Averaging 2 25 goals a game and conceding an average of 0 4 Damn
Wow the next best after Parma s 10 goals allowed is 25
looks like Ligue 1
Still more competitive than Ligue 1
Literally it s a nine point gap at the top
Only a more competitive title race though In the CL race EL race and relegation battle Ligue 1 is the most competitive of the top 6 leagues
Basically I have a tiny dick but at least my arms and legs are nice
Does this have to be brung up in every thread on r Soccer PSG are ruining football we get it
do you have to be butthurt I didn t say shit about PSG it s just funny how the Ligue 1 table is Tbh pretty much same thing is in Bundesliga aswell
It s good to see San Marino doing so well too after their poor performances at international level
I think the club was actually relegated last year
I realise of course that it s actually a club not the international team but they are actually from San Marino and are they only team from there that currently take part in the Italian league system and so are one of only a small number of clubs that play in the different countries league to their own https en wikipedia org wiki List of association football clubs playing in the league of another country
Yeah I was just speaking to the form of the club Love that list IIRC Vaduz regularly plays in the EL qualifiers as the Liechtenstein cup champions despite playing each season in the Swiss Super League
Similar to how Montreal Impact qualified for the Concacaf champ league and got to the final via the canadian cup despite being fairly shit in the MLS during that time
It s actually one of the most fun challenges you can do on football manager since you get a lot of regens with the San Marinian nationality so if you are also manager of the national San Marinian team you could improve it immensely if you also improve the youth and training facillities at club level with the money you get from going up the leagues
One of the most tedious and frustrating you mean Oh hey excellent regen in a position of need let s see how that goes oh Italy caps him once in a 2 minute substitute appearance and then never calls him up again Awesome
Yeah sometimes it can be I guess you have to be lucky sometimes for the regen to only have San Marinian nationality I usually just neglect him or sell if he doesn t want to play for the national team But despite this it s still one of the most rewarding challenges to see your little San Marino beat decent european nations like Czech Republic or Poland and eventually qualify for the EC and start beating really good teams and maybe even win it
FM is love Took me 23 seasons but I won the Europa League with Izegem
Impressive but that going to be a lot harder when FM implement those shitty new rules thought up by our FA
Stad van bustels en skoens
No Irish clubs mentioned Not to drag up that debate
There is an entry on a Northern Irish club in a RoI league but maybe that s not what you re talking about
That must be what he s talking about we don t have any teams that would play in England Scotlad Wales so it must be that On that topic though I m sure there are plenty of Republic of Ireland teams that play in Northern Irish leagues and vica versa at amateur level
I missed it Probably Derry City
Yeah From your wording I thought there might be some controversial situation that wasn t public enough to be on the page
Anyone know how Lucarelli is doing I love a captain who stays with the ship Real respect for the guy
He is doing well he gave an interview saying that if Parma were still in Serie A he would be forced to retire but by going down with them he ll be able to continue for a few more years
What a legend
plot twist he secretly orchestrated the whole thing to bring down Parmalat in an effort to extend his footballing career
Probably bossing Parma s defence and transforming into a legendario for them
Sounds like a football manager dream
I want to do a FM challenge and bring them back to Seria A
Easiest challenge ever
In a game perhaps in real life it will be difficult Serie B being their natural level
In the game it s a pain in the middle of the ass In FM16 they start in Serie B WTF and they re extremely shit They go down no matter what you do unless you loan in a million new players No matter which they ll upgrade the team anyways Never has a challenge been more of a pain
That s weird i just checked and in my game Parma are in Serie D you can t even manage them without a custom database Their team is more than enough to easily get promoted from Serie D at least
What the hell I do have a league pack The one at sortitoutsi and they start in B
I have all the Sortitoutsi packs and Parma start out in Serie D for me
What the fuck tho I managed them for the first season in serie B
I wonder if there was maybe some patch update that fixed that
Check your start date It might impact which league they start on I also noticed that sometimes in FM if I pick too early a start date all sorts of weird things happen like players who weren t at a respective team are all of a sudden there Also noticed some of those players have ridiculous salaries compared to the team average Also I only got FM around christmas It s possible they patched their database later on
Yeah I m doing it and got 3 promotions in a row Your wage budget and transfer budget are way higher than anyone else in Serie D B except for a team or two that got relegated from Serie A
Easier than Rangers to SPL in 2013
CSKA Sofia who were relegated to the third tier of Bulgarian football last year for financial problems have won all 16 of their games so far and have a goal difference of 65 1
And even the lone goal they allowed was an own goal Also they are through to the Bulgarian Cup semis they could qualify for Europa League as a 3rd tier club
Which would be awesome
That would be like Burton Albion qualifying Would be insane
It s more like Man U got relegated to the third division and won the FA Cup Sofia has won 31 Bulgarian titles and made the Champions League quarters 4 times and semis twice
would the league allow that
Don t think it s up to them
Haha so basically fifa manager mode That s crazy
Turn up that difficulty brah
if they qualify for Europa by winning the Bulgarian Cup the difficulty goes from Semi Pro to Ultimate
Also Hereford FC the phoenix club of Hereford United they were in the Conference National in 2013 14 then were expelled from the league and went under during the 2014 15 season are now top of the Midland Football League Premier Division 9th tier with a 10 point lead a record of 20 2 3 and a 57 goal difference
That may be true but Parma wasn t relegated just because of performances they were bankrupt and a lot of players left not to mention the other players that were unpaid and everything So they re basically starting from scratch
That is the exact same as what he just mentioned It sounds like you took his comment to sort of one up Parma which probably wasn t his intentions
My bad then
Yeah I didn t mean to one up Parma
Copa90 had a pretty good minidocumentary on them https www youtube com watch v zHCD7tfJmr8 Glad theyre doing good
Well
bene
Fewer
Interesting accent the head of communications had is that a Parma accent
Probably a stupid question but where do relegated teams go after Serie D
They go to a lovely farm in the country where they spend the rest of their days with all the other relegated teams and spend all day running around and having fun Don t worry so much about it champ Now run along there inside dinner is ready and your mother is waiting That s a good boy ruffles hair
shoots Parma
I don t know what I just read but I enjoyed every word of it
Eccellenza is the 5th tier Serie D is the top semi pro league promotion to the 3rd tier Lega Pro is the lowest professional league in Italy
Cheers
I can only imagine how Juve would have done if we had been relegated to Serie D
Can t really compare I m not sure so many talented players would have stuck around for a multi year haul Maybe Rangers would be a better comparison of a top club immediately dropping to 4th tier Two promotions in three years
Is there any players left in the team from last year
Oh understandable Would be cool to see player stay but yeah Hope lucarelli stay with them and they get back to the top division
Well to be fair the club wouldn t be able to pay them even Lucarelli on his new much smaller contract earns 5 times more than the next in line
Yeah i understand why they did not stay at the club or why the club could not keep them
Damn if only Pompey could have done that
Falling and hitting every branch on the way down is worse than falling straight onto the soft grass but there s always the chance you can grab and hold a branch
Wait San Marino play in Serie D I always wondered how they stay match fit but you learn something new every day
IF you re not joking it s a club called San Marino
Well what Parma is for Serie D is what PSG is for League 1 lololo
I don t know I think we would be dominating even more if we were in the third division of english football
You ve clearly never played against Coventry City Joe Cole plays for them
You re right my calculations are definitely off
Well played
Is there a serie E
The 5th tier is called Eccellenza So in a way you could call it Serie E
The one below Serie D is called Eccellenza
Meanwhile we went from almost getting promoted back to Serie A to being a middling Serie B team fml
When I saw your comment just now on mobile I thought you d have Pescara flair but this fits even more
Thanks cries profusely
If they draw their next game then their form for this season will be a palindrome
Great observation but unfortunately it s read bottom up not top down Bugged me when I saw it too Which means that without their most recent match a draw a few days ago it was a palindrome
Apparently I completely ignored all the dates on the left hand side there Weird way for them to sort it though
Good to see hoping they come back soon Such a shame they went down as they had a great history
They don t have any history just did well in the 90s bankrolled by a billionaire
They do just relatively recent history what suddenly the 90s doesn t count as history any more They were an incredible team filled with many players who have since become legends
They were good to watch in the late nineties when Crespo was there
Not to mention Veron Thuram Cannavaro Buffon Adriano Mutu etc
That team in its day man I used to have a Crespo poster up on my wall
Yeah but that team was kinda built over frauds
It was always my impression that the fraud occurred sometime closer to 2005 The Parma teams prior to the fraud were already incredible
Ah thanks for the clarification not Italian so the translation was useful
You of all teams to show no sympathy
Read my other comment instead of downvoting and judging me Juve wasn t built on the ruin of so many families
All I said is to have some sympathy You clearly don t Btw match fixing isn t exactly with victims either Anyway whatever Have a good day
No offense but we re talking about something bigger than football here Biggest bankruptcy in Europe s history which caused thousands of workers to be out of job overnight and thousands of families and pensioners to lose their investments with the company It s hard to empathize with a club whose success was based on all that
Couldn t have written it any better than that
Have some respect since the club you support is affiliated with Juve
Supposed billionaire company P
Surely Leeds will return to form as well
I fucking hope not haha
Don t worry Leeds fans have been saying they ll get back in the Prem for years Hasn t happened yet
In a way I wouldn t mind them back in the league Our Arsenal rivalry has gone a bit soft but bloody hell the away days over there would be incredible Wouldn t them getting up and then sending them back down again
I want them to come up break Derby County s record and then never come back
Living the dream
I very much doubt it
still isn t this like the third time it happened to them
They are coming back
Wait they didn t disappear completely
I don t know anything about football but in English you say series even when it s singular Hope that helps
Serie D is the name in Italian for the third division
How confusing Thanks
Serie A B C is the name of the league not an attempt at a translation For comparison the Spanish league is called La liga and not The league which is obviously the translation
Ah I m used to a Dutch friend who would always say that Thanks for the correction
Then why are you on r soccer
It was just fairly high up in r all
And there s an example of the two kinds of responses to things You are a shitty person Good luck
Yeah the smug asshat who goes around lecturing people on things he admittedly knows nothing about is clearly the one who should judge other people s character
I was never smug It s a common translation error due to the quirks of English A Dutch friend of mine frequently had trouble with this when talking about a TV series I tried to be politely helpful and someone corrected me because it turns out the quirk here is that it s being used as a proper noun I thanked them for explqining and moved on Then you come along to be rude to people you don t know Maybe you ve had a bad day I don t know I m sorry if I offended you but good luck and have fun
You were both smug and rude Lecturing to others always is especially when you begin your sentence by mentioning that you have no idea what you are talking about If you don t want people to be rude to you you could start by not treating them like they were idiots
I wasn t lecturing dude Like I said I ve known other people who have made the mistake and were glad to learn how to improve further I was trying to help and nothing else That may not have come across and as I have already said I am sorry for that

Well Fewer Is there any players left in the EL qualifiers as the Liechtenstein cup champions despite playing each season in the middle of the top 6 leagues
What do you mean
If anything I d say that s underachieving
How All their players were released from contract apart from Lucarelli who stayed on at much lower wage It s not like the same team from Serie A last season stayed together and is winning Serie D
Just to add to that in case others made a similar assumption even a few stars from Juve left when they dropped to Serie B a decade ago including Thuram Zlatan and Cannavaro And Parma s drop was much much more drastic
What I love about when Juve was relegated was that Trezeguet stayed and helped them go up again When we got relegated Trezeguet moved here divorced his wife when she didn t want to move here joined us out of the blue and gout us up again Such a shame Passarella was well Passarella
Trez was a hero
Indeed
Lucarelli s a legend for staying Good man
Oh you would know a thing or two about underachieving don t you
Yeah we finish in division 4 all the time
4th in your division
4th 4th division Just because you support a Championship side doesn t mean we all have to put up with such dross
Man you don t even know the teams in your own league How sad is that
didn t know 9th in the prem is the championship mate so Arsenal must be a Europa League team being only UCL knockout stage quality yeah you fucking grade A idiot
We re just as much of a Championship side as you are
You re the reason everyone else hates the big clubs

People can criticise and moan all they like but at least some people are trying to do something about it Ticket prices in England are a fucking joke not just in the Prem not just for Liverpool all the way down Half the people here aren t affected by any of this anyway so are always quick to jump on the lol want to be a big club then u have to pay big prices bandwagon but if you can t see how paying 77 to watch a football match for 90 minutes is a joke then there is no helping you And that is by no means the most expensive in the league either Edit for reference ticket prices for a Category A game top teams at Upton Park for non members vary from 70 at band 4 seats to 95 for band 1 If any of you can justify 95 fucking pounds for a game of football I will be absolutely amazed
This was a junior season ticket But when Portsmouth were in league one I paid 70 for a SEASON ticket Puts 77 a game into perspective
I hear season tickets for Bayern Munich run about 330 Euros
But supply and demand says the clueless helmet who watches matches behind his screen with his belly button full of Doritos crumbs Supply and demand is one thing ripping off the people that make your club worthwhile is another Fans are customers yes They are also the ones that make the sport what it is
When Boro were still in the prem my mate got a junior season ticket for 95
For comparison im considering buying a season ticket for my club biggest in norway that s in some financial trouble and have been for some time It ll cost me about 160 which will include the expense of buying a membership to the fanclub
Spot on I paid 250 when we were in the Championship but that was purely because I was under a certain age As soon as you re an adult it jumped 400 in price Now I get paying more for better football but it s beginning to take the absolute royal piss And we re the mugs because we all still keep going myself included
Well 400 isnt too far off what you have to pay for the priciest tickets but my club also has the cheapest tickets for the tickets alloted to the fanclub
Sorry meant it jumped up by 400 from 250 up to 650 And that s the lowest price band too
well shit I read your other comment and was about to say that I d probably be just okay with paying 400 pounds for a season ticket to PL football
Just shy of a grand a year I could justify that for myself Not so much for a family
For comparison at Liverpool it costs about 30 a year to be a member something that is basically essential to do to have a chance of buying tickets There are also plenty of people who pay for these memberships and then don t even get to buy any tickets because demand was so high FSG have done a lot of good for the club but there are justifiable reasons that fans have started to feel more like customers
So the exact same shitty setup as our club then The only way out of the membership is a ST
Are you a member of the club or the fanclub At rosenborg those are two different things with the fanclub being an independent organization
Maybe they d be in less financial trouble if they charged more for the tickets Norwegians can afford it
We re in financial trouble because we relied on money coming in from champions league group play every year when that gravy train ended we took a big hit We re not in immediate danger though and have everything under control as far as I understand it but we are having to cut a bit over 10 of our operating costs this season on top of other cuts weve done allready before our CEO will declare us as financially healthy
Should see the way some people on our sub are trying to justify it it s sickening Someone put it best when they said that FSG would be receiving a lot more criticism if they were from China or the Middle East
Agree with that The fact that chap in the top comment screenshot their website which literally calls for converting supporters to customers is a joke
I mean like it or not that what pretty much every professional sports team this day in age wants Just for some silly reason they put it on their website for everyone to see
Not trying to get into a whole Americans vs local fans thing but Americans by and large have far more disposable income than most people in the UK A lot of football grounds are in extremely deprived areas as well where the difference between 50 and 77 is a complete deal breaker for them If you only go 1 2 times per season a net difference of 30 or 60 quid isn t that bad but these people shouting about the pricing scheme being fine and reasonable aren t local and therefore aren t extrapolating that price bump across 19 home games and then the variable prices of 19 away games
The prices for NFL tickets are also ridiculously high So it s I can watch Liverpool for only 77 What a great deal a ticket for the Dallas Cowboys costs me 200
The NFL is set up almost intentionally to be a television first experience Going to a game is generally miserable expensive cold and takes all fucking day I do think a big part of the reason teams can charge so much for tickets is because a lot of people are only really interested in going to one or two games a year
And the season is 14 games 16 games a season
But every game takes about a month to finish so it all evens out
My friend offered me a free ticket the other day but it s hard enough sitting through an NFL game on TV can t imagine actually driving 2 hours to watch the game plus sitting in the stands all day just to see 11 minutes of actual sport being played source
The whole 11 minutes of action is not really a valid argument If you have an understanding of what is going on in between plays and before the snap there is a decent amount of action
But all other sports I can think of have that too but way more playing time It s just a boring sport to watch
Calling either sport boring to watch is borderline moronic considering the fanbases and viewership of each sport You just don t understand one of them
And people say the same thing about footie I love football and soccer
16 games But there are only 8 home games a season so tickets are at a premium Even if your team makes it all the way to the Super Bowl at most you ll see 10 home games
16 games with only 8 home games per team Unless of course they re one of the teams that plays a game in London edit plus 4 preseason games of which two are home games and the season ticket holders are forced to purchase tickets for these games if they want to keep their season tickets
and you can t resell preseason game tickets No one wants them I can t even give away preseason tickets to people
I cannot agree on this Attending NFL games is awesome if you are a fan And they also have a large number of season ticket holders A lot of people are more interested than just going to one or two games A big difference is that the local fans tend to consist of a whole state rather than part of a city Edit Am I the only person who can watch football and american football without bashing either Being from New Orleans I had to deal with soccer sucks and soccer is so boring my whole life Everywhere else they say the NFL sucks which I disagree with also
Ah agree to disagree mate I hate going It s normally freezing and it s really hard to follow what s happening on the field from the seats I enjoy it much more watching on TV That s a good point about the local fans though larger support bases and catchment areas plus far fewer games equal high ticket prices
I don t understand the whole freezing thing There s a lot of warm games Now if you re talking Vikings Bears and Patriots I can agree
Surely the Packers Green Bay Lions Detroit and the Bills Buffalo also have a lot of cold nights while at home Lambeau field has quite the reputation for winter games That said a large chunk of the NFL season is in the fall and winter which leads to cold dreary games Anywhere north of Washington DC is bad primarily in the central and Eastern US and this includes the Giants Jets Steelers Bengals Browns Colts Ravens etc Sure this winter has been mild But the previous couple of winters were quite the nightmare It s not too ridiculous an opinion to have
It s hard for me to take someone that supports a team from Glasgow complaining about the cold seriously A cold Tuesday night away in Inverness can t be much better than an NFL game
So to bring people to the matches they prevent anyone else to watch the match on local tv unless it s sold old Really
Up until this last season yup
yeah but i called their bluff in the process i discovered that watching a blank screen is more entertaining than a San Diego Chargers game
I think there was a threshold you had to break not always sold out but yes If you had the right sports package with your provider you could still get the game If you didn t every bar would have it
That s bizarre logic If people only wanted to go to one game a season then demand would be less and the team s would be able to charge less Simple economics really
Chicago Blackhawks cost me 250
The Hawks I mean yall have been good for a while but that s insane That s like Mapple Leaf territory
Ya I think the absolute cheapest tickets you can get are like 60 I should add I pay 250 for lower bowl center ice But its still insane They jump the prices like 20 every year
Dollars to Euros that is pretty much exactly what my season tickets cost
That s crazy We have 4 season tickets for the Blackhawks and they are 10k each I am able to buy season tickets for the mls for like 150
Well at least the soccer is still affordable right I couldnt imagine spending 10k on tickets for sports games for me the price of a game is about the same as the price of a movie and that feels about right to me
Well one of the reasons I spend 40k on tickets is I give a lot away to clients customers as little gifts Also sell them to friends from time to time So its kinda a spend money to make money scenario for me I do have friends though who spend 20 30k on season tickets and go to every game and don t sell any Its pretty crazy
As a business expense it makes sense as long as it s worth it But for my own personal hobby It wouldnt feel right even if I could easily afford it
200 dollars lmao thats cute its like 400 for nosebleeds
I m not American so I don t exactly know how much tickets cost Only that the prices are significantly higher than PL tickets
No worries Its just kind of funny I look at a thing like this and im like damn 77 quid aint even that bad When in reality it is really bad ive just been so desensitized to the bullshit prices
I used to pay equally outrageous prices when I lived back in Canada The only solution unfortunately is to boycott It s a shame that it s so hard for people to organize to force some change
Are you talking hockey or soccer Because in Montreal you can get away with 20 dollars for an Impact ticket and I doubt it s that much more expensive in the RoC
What you basing your belief that Americans have so much more disposable income All the data I have seen says they are comparable http www businessinsider com disposable income infographic 2015 3
When we were in the Conference last season we were selling tickets for 25 25 Absolute joke whenever the big clubs raise their prices it causes a ripple effect down the divisions
Exactly You can go see Bayern for 27 if you want to sit even less if you want to stand Things are out of control and have been for a while now
Ten quid admittedly for a student at a Pats match 15 for the cup final in the Aviva which is Ireland s international stadium
most people on here see ticket prices as a minor surcharge on top of their plane ticket and hotel
I don t think most people on here plan transatlantic flights to catch West Ham at Stoke
You act like high ticket prices are only exclusive to England High ticket prices suck for everyone regardless of where they are from The NFL has absolutely ridiculous ticket prices as do top teams from Major League Baseball NBA and the NHL
Baseball is the only affordable choice in many markets
Well that and soccer DC United tickets never run me more than 25 or 30 dollars and with how many promotional deals they do to try and boost attendance they end up closer to 10 or 15 dollars in a lot of cases
It seems every MLS fan wants the league to become one of the top leagues in the world but I am totally fine with the current quality and 15 tickets
Indy Eleven tickets are as low as 10
Someone hasn t been to the new Yankee stadium it seems Here in the NYC area Mets Yankees tickets are both extremely expensive and in high demand Soccer is the only affordable sport unless you fancy going to watch the WNBA
We pay 250 for Chicago Blackhawks tickets 250 for a hockey game
Honestly that s fucking appalling If West Ham started charging that they d get a solid fuck off from me Absolute joke
I m so used to american prices that 77 pounds doesn t even seem that bad to me
Cool Doesn t take away from the fact that these price increases are ridiculous and not needed
I m not saying they aren t I m just saying its interesting with the sports culture and prices in the US vs England
I ll try explain as best I can and correct me if I m wrong about any assumptions I make about US Sports teams The general attitude in the UK is that football has always and always should be the peoples game with rugby and especially cricket the sport of the upper classes generations ago obviously it s not quite the same now A lot of premier league football clubs e g Man Utd began basically as people who were working together and Everton began just so some lads could play sport through the winter yet by incredible circumstances they have become global powerhouses Whereas I believe that most American sports teams have mostly been set out as large scale teams and businesses from the off set In England the football teams almost started just as a little community with a relationship with local people That s why there was a huge opposition initially to football even being shown on TV as it could alienate the connection between the fans who live locally and the club itself 50 years on and it appears that the doubts people had aren t exactly miles away from fruition Liverpool and many many other clubs have clearly forgotten what the club was initially about and are selling tickets at a higher price because they know they ll be sold to people who are willing to pay a premium for their one or two games a year and they re honestly not fazed about severing ties with the local community despite what the club origins were It s taken decades for each club to create their certain characteristics and personality per se and unfortunately it s not taken very long since the Premier League era began and the huge injection of cash into the game for the executives and the like to force changes that move towards losing the identity of the club that took so long to build up TL DR A the price for 77 for 90 minutes of football is absolutely ridiculous anyway and B it looks even worse when considering the context of the club and how distant that is from today Of course it is completely the prerogative of the executives of Liverpool Football Club and others to make as much money as possible as that s the world we live in today However that doesn t mean that the fans should just lie down and accept it as before any American investment group came along it was their club
Yea you re wrong there The NHL is almost a 100 years old and started out as a couple of good ole boys just playing the game with 6 teams The ticket prices between teams in the same league are VASTLY different based on market size and how good the team is It isn t anywhere near the similarity between prices of tickets like Aston Villa vs Liverpool Avg Leafs ticket is 120 Avg Florida ticket is 34
Yeah my bad on that one I looked up the Blackhawks and they seemed to have spawned out of a large business venture and just assumed others were like that Exactly the premier league is just ridiculous A list prices to watch B list players playing C list football at Anfield at the moment
Makes me wonder if the only reason my season ticket per match is still only 38 quid is because of our attendances I would certainly not renew if they were 77 Insane
Wouldn t surprise anyone to see price hikes I bet Ed and the Glazers I m sure have no need or want to appeal to locals as OT is such a tourist attraction Not there s anything bad going to watch the game occasionally and not die hard but it s just a fact that they re willing to pay a premium
Yeah Caps tickets are routinely around 100 150 and they haven t won 3 Stanley Cups in 6 years At this point I d rather watch games on TV or the web
In Chicago I bought tickets for when they play in my city and they were 60 a piece Expensive for hockey but they re both really good teams Granted I m bringing extra tissues because of the nosebleed I ll have in these God awful seats
Tbh I like nose bleeds just as much as sitting up close You can see the play develop a lot better
My buddy and I have been working in Ireland for a while now and now that Bilic is West Ham coach we wanted to drop by for a game or two have some fun etc After we saw the prices it was just nope not gonna happen any time soon And we weren t even watching some big games we actually wanted to see a game vs some smaller team One day one day
Spot on mate It s fucking disgusting
You re talking to the wrong crowd Americans routinely pay 200 300 per game for NFL tickets Canadians and some American markets are paying that much for hockey tickets The expensive tickets for MLS matches are around 50 pounds I ve always wondered how tickets to soccer matches are so cheap in England actually
their are only 8 home games in an NFL season big difference from 18 and yes it is still ridiculously expensive
Also I d imagine that the fact that there are so few teams in the NFL plays a part too Especially considering the population size of the US
Difference is that Britain is more left leaning than America and football is seen as a working class game that is being ruined by capitalism kind of American s pay so much but so many facets of your country is based around money that it s seen as ok whereas in England there is a view that football is ingrained in society and money should no isolated a large percentage of the population to participate in something that has been traditionally so ingrained in society
I lived in Indianapolis for 3 months last year and the games cost me about 80 a ticket One of those were against the Pats too who the Colts hate Also went to a prime time game against the Jets
I ve payed less to see The Who
Just cause one thing is over priced doesn t mean everything should be
I may be making a very large generalization so please tell me if I m wrong but from what I have read Liverpool isn t the most wealthy area so making working class fans pay 77 pounds is pretty messed up
Seeing an NHL game in my hometown can cost you well over 200 100 a ticket And these seats aren t even close to the ice those ones can run at at least 400 a ticket It s insane here too with our leagues
Yeah that is completely outrageous Don t think I d bother more than once a year if it were me
World cup final
Fans boycotted the away games under Hodgson the only thing that did was make the club open it up to members who were willing to pay if the core supporters did not purchase anything the club would happily sell it on to day trippers and tourists which would reduce the atmosphere further Although this isnt the best solution it s better than doing nothing and accept what s happening
There is a difference between away and home though I don t know how many season ticket holders you have but I d guess at least 25k probably more If enough of them stay firm boycott and don t sell their ticket on then there s nothing the club can do in terms of opening those tickets up At least I don t think the club can sell a ticket it has already sold Problem comes with the super fans who won t go against their club no matter what
If you re going to protest at least do it the proper way like AC Milan and just dont turn up Edit Just adding that I 100 agree with the sentiment to protest as the prices are ridiculous but think it s the wrong way to do it especially when the owners have this on their website
Milan didn t even stick to it they should learn from Lazio fans who boycotted for 21 games
Or the Lazio team who didn t turn up all season
Our ultras went only to amateur matches for a whole season long simply because they thought that the president was being a dick
Was noch kannst du ber das erz hlen sorry for butchering your mother tongue I m trying to practice
Roma have been doing the same for the youth team
Lazio came 3rd their best result in years
did anything come of that
Its kind of an awkward situation because in a way both sides got what they wanted and the boycott stopped Although that was shortlived as the city decided to split the curva end section of the stadium and place a barrier right down the middle of it which has spawned an entirely new boycott but this time from both Lazio and Roma ultras Its a huge issue for both clubs and the city because they are all losing money and now its just a question of who will blink first and it won t be the ultras But historically there have been countless occasions where the fans ultras have forced a club or the league to change something or repeal a recent decision not sell a player etc because of protests I m certain the same tactics could work in England if there was more unity among the fans but I also acknowledge that given what has already happened its quite late in the day
Sorry for my ignorance but why is the fence such a big deal e also why did they put it up
They changed this to this now

Actually no Here is how it was in June 2015 Here is the recent article confirming it
haha i actually just looked it up for myself and yep i was wrong Should have checked the waybackmachine instead of believing reddit comments
The problem with football in England is that it s such a big tourist attraction If a regular going fan didn t buy a ticket then somebody else would The only way would be to buy a ticket and then not turn up at all but most people can t really afford to just throw that amount of money away
The percentage of tourists at games is so ridiculously overstated on this sub a widespread boycott would massively impact the attendances Most of the match going fans will be season ticket holders anyway if they didn t attend nobody would take their place
I don t think the amount of tourists is overstated at all Last match I went to I wasn t sat by a single scouser
Say a whole fan section was missing Most of them are season ticket holders That s make an impact no
Sounds heavenly
I wonder how much extra he paid for that ticket
are you American because they segregate the Americans off into a separate section
Nope I m a scouser
Well that s retarded I want to be in with the regulars and have fun Not sit and be quiet with tourists
not really you are usually with an American supporters group which is how they segregate you off If you buy a loose ticket that wont happen
I mean Arsenal sold 40k season tickets for their 60k stadium If none of those season ticket holders went it would make a huge impact even if they sold literally every single other ticket to a tourist
Tourists go to the games because they think they ll get a proper footy feeling there Probably shouldn t go to those stadiums in the first place for that but either way if fans would outright stop going to any games of Liverpool or Arsenal or Chelsea the tourists would do so as well since it s no longer an experience worth making and even less so for those prices
That makes no sense If it s for one game then all the tourists will still go since they likely bought that ticket way in advance
A lot of season ticket holders will sell their tickets to tourists for less popular games There are loads of tourists at Anfield probably more than any other stadium in the PL
Not sure they would sell their ticket if it was an organised boycott though
Do you know how much Norwegian supporters are willing to pay for a ticket for a Cat B or C game I know many season ticket holders that have profited three or four times over from the amount they need to spend for their renewal I only mention Norwegians because a guy I know has said that he has got up to 200 a ticket from some of them and that they usually pay the most
The main problem is the vast majority of Liverpool PL home tickets Like 90 of stadium revenue are already sold They sell them at the beginning of the season So you d have to boycott a at the beginning of the season and pick a game to do it but it wouldn t work because the demand is so high that there s probably 45k Liverpool fans who would go regardless
You should see the amount of Koreans there are at WHL now that Son is playing for us
Absolutely mate I wish talks would be more productive before the match but this seems the best way right now
What s the alternative then
The best way would be to start a protest group and physically stop people from entering the ground on match day
There s a reason you see season tickets sold out sign up for the waiting lines ads all the time The clubs are hugely dependent on the regular fans
Out of interest how easy is it to buy a ticket to say anfield or old Trafford for a prem game as a tourist Its always seemed a difficult thing to do via the main channels Or is it mainly a stub hub thing
I liked the way we AIK and Djurg rden protested against SvFF Swedish FA a few years back Here s a link We stayed silent for the first 10 minutes of a derby showing SvFF how boring it would be without the fans they were so dead set on opposing
Nobody would notice the difference if they did the same thing at Anfield
Point
That s awesome Did it work though
It spread awareness Christ it sounds like I m talking about a charity and I do feel the dialogue between the fans and SvFF has gotten less hostile and more productive apart from the pyro fiasco but it didn t change things overnight of course
That s good to hear Are there any similar protests planned or is it good enough that you won t have to resort to that level of protesting It was quite a change from silent to loud they managed to pull off Very impressive really Would love to see something like this over in the PL but doubt any of the big clubs would
We will probably always pull out the occasional SvFF football murderers song when times call for it but nothing like this planned no I m also not as close to the supporter culture now that I can t attend every game anymore but at least I think so Being there was surreal as fuck you would hear the occasional voice followed by thousands immediately trying to quiet it down in as quiet manner as possible Also hearing the players shouting for the ball etc was a new experience
Cool thanks for sharing
No worries
Well it s a bit easier to make a 80 000 seater stadium seem empty than a 45 000 one
Is that transforming fans into customers image genuine Fucking hell People like me have been saying that for years about the contempt in which supporters are treated by their clubs in England said the same about my club too and here are owners of a high profile Premier League club openly proclaiming it with no shame Fuck me Football has gone to the dogs
Fucking hell that s real
I pay 36 and already think that is stretching it can t imagine having to pay 77 what a fucking joke
PL getting the biggest TV deal in history of football and how do they thank their fans raise the ticket prices which are already obscenely high good job lol
Perhaps I don t understand but i thought there was just a post that Liverpool was lowering prices
Yup a very clever PR move by the club to usher in the new pricing structure 20 000 tickets a year not per game will be 9 but pretty much all the rest will be rising quite considerably
That s not true at all it was bad enough you don t need to exaggerate it They lowered a shit load of season ticket prices match day tickets also got less generous pricing in the same seats but the rises they put in place in some of the seats that didn t get cuts were huge and unwarranted
It was sugarcoated PR
it wasn t Ticket prices have been tiered so that people who go to more games will end up paying less and those who don t aka foreigners and Londoners more
If they want to protest why not pitch invasions That d cost the club some money
And risk getting banned fined or even worse Not the brightest idea
Expelled
I got it Hermione don t worry
That s more than an U18 Bolton season ticket when we were a top ten PL team
Better idea than the silent protest they ve been doing all season
actually since klopp the stadium has been pretty buzzing unless we re playing awfully boring football then thats fair
We are that awfully boring team
Hey
Wait I m confused They re going to buy the tickets at that price then walk out of the stadium
That ll show em
Oh dear
A big selling point for Liverpool s brand is the passion and loyalty of the fans They won t want TV commentators talking about how they re driving away supporters
But if the bad publicity won t bring down revenue because those fans are still buying everything it won t change anything They will simply wait out the storm And let their PR team patch up the bad publicity after it s over
A walkout is not the final step it is a warning to let the owners know the fans are unhappy and are serious about it
By buying the very same overpriced tickets Time for FSG to raise prices to 95 so fans will protest in the 95th minute
There s loads of tourists willing to fill up Anfield I m sure
Not just tourists Liverpool fans that go once or twice a year will take advantage of others staying away too
If I m honest I d happily pay a one off to go see Liverpool as my SO is a fan and I will see any game But paying that even once every two years for a game would sting for me Paying for Arsenal tickets feels like they have a vacuum cleaner in my wallet
Normally I would agree but the article stated that this is in protest to the next seasons ticket price structure not this season The protest will take place this time round because it has already been bought Nobody has said anything about paying into the new prices next season Please for the love of fuck sake read the article before you comment
If they didn t buy the tickets someone else would
The club would make more money from day trippers anyway
People criticising this are idiots People are really suggesting that fans who have forked out hundreds for season tickets should stay away for the rest of the season to prove a point
Klopp is going to love this
Well to be fair if he doesn t want it to happen then he s got to throw his weight around behind the scenes He s a big believer in the fans and club being as one If he wants that here then he has to do what he can to ease the transition
There is absolutely fuck all Klopp can do about ticket prices
Well he has more say than me you or any of the fans
Fans have a lot of power the problem is the amount of fans who aren t doing anything Sure you can get thousands of people to boycott and not buy tickets but then there are thousands of fans who are going to keep buying tickets If everyone actually did boycott I mean every single fan then prices would plummet but that s way easier said than done
which isn t hard since we can also do fuck all
Sorry but a manager who has been there for a few months has absolutely no say in these financial decisions
Not real surprised about high ticket prices at LFC FSG just raised Red Sox ticket prices and they finished in last place last season They will set ticket prices as high as they can sell them
Wouldn t be the first time this season Liverpool fans did that
Anybody criticising this is either on the wind up or doesn t get it
Correct me if I am wrong but wasn t there a post a few days ago that said liverpool tickets would be a lot cheaper and it would be almost free for students
Yup a very clever PR move by the club to usher in the new pricing structure 20 000 tickets a year not per game will be 9 but pretty much all the rest will be rising quite considerably
no they aren t 45 percent of seats are decreasing in price
A lot of tickets did get a price drop but the ones that didn t more often than not got huge price rises
You ll never walkout alone
Sorry folks If you want non commercialized football go watch the lower leagues It s an unpopular sentiment and believe me I don t like it either But there s too much money to be made in football it s a business and ticket prices are a cog in an economic model to make profit for the club
Could an implement ticket pice cap be beneficial
No Basic economics tells me that that would just open up the market to touts
Didn t they recently announce 7 tickets and stuff
why do a walk out protest The owners will not give a shit you have already paid for the ticket Do a do not walk in and pay protest

Oh I m sure he s just there to recoup Neville s spirit
He s on a bit of tour around Europe he was at Milan vs Inter on Sunday
Saw a video he posted of his son playing keepy uppy in the centre of the San Siro pitch Not a bad day out
If you ever get the chance go to the Milan derby I went post Mourinho era when Seedorf was managed they won 1 0 the atmosphere exploded
why
He was at Milan vs Inter last week think he s just going around Europe for something tv related could be wrong
Trying his hand at being a journalist now
Cause he s tired of watching Liverpool players train More likely Thursday s poker night with Mascherano and Suarez
From the look on Suarez s face he still can t understand a word Carragher is saying
Nobody does really we just nod and pretend
This is the perfect video for you https www youtube com watch v hJ8C AAwf7A
This one is my favourite
Reunited and it feels so goooood
Careful Messi He will break your legs
As if a 38 year old Jamie Carragher is fast enough to get within tackling distance of Messi
never discount the speed of a scouser he could nick the studs off Messi s boots and Messi wouldn t even notice
He was slow for a long time and was able to takeout loads of fast players
Defenders are usually slower than wingers and strikers but they rely on their positioning and intelligence to intercept and make tackles
Positioning and Intelligence were Carragher s strong points
Sometimes timing is more important than speed
Visiting this sub must be exhausting if you take all the comments literally
Not as exhausting as it must be for someone who doesn t know what a joke is
So it s Mascherano Suarez some argentinian bloke but who is the fourth aside from Carragher x4 Don t recognize him at all
Ivana
Ivan Rakitic
deleted
Well at the very least Mascherano and Suarez know him given their affinity with Liverpool But honestly I guess anybody worth his salt in European football should in some way know who Carragher is
never knew Neville was playing yesterday to get wrecked xD
Out of interest did you envisage this comment going down well
oh no absolutely not haha I was angry at the title being directed at Neville as if Valencia s players were of no blame for the defeat yesterday and had to type something out to vent my anger
This is either just horrible timing or he is being a cunt on purpose
As if probably doing something for sky or his column you donkey
Best use of as if I ve heard in 10 years
Can you tell us about that fateful day 10 years ago
I m sure he was a bit extra enthusiastic though
That s why I said it might be horrible timing you donkey
Ohhhh you got him good there

It is so infuriating to watch a talented player being treated like that Glad he could still show great defending thoughout the game I really hope the dicks who were chanting can get picked out and punished
If they heavily fine the club the club will suffer and the offending supporters might just realize that they re hurting the very club they re there to support It will then be in both the clubs and the fans best interest to put an end to it I imagine they d stop if they were fined frequently enough and with large enough fines that they would have to sell players to be able to pay performances dipping maybe even in danger of being relegated If not they deserve everything they get Of course there is potential for sabotage Rival fans could find their way into the home fans stands and be racist pricks on purpose to get the opposing club in trouble and I don t really have a good solution on how to deal with that
They won t see it as we are wrong they will see it we are being punished unfairly and will rationalize away their racism What Lazio and clubs with repeated offenses really need to do is crack down on security and increase the amount of security in the stands If someone racially abuses players give them a lifetime ban
To clarify I am not talking exclusively about punishing the club with fines but the people in the stands that are caught on tape for racist abuse
You re completely right Look at the Russian league black players cant even play and win for their own fans without getting the same abuse Its absolutely absurd that its 2016 and these fuckwits with no respect are still getting away with it They have put sanctions on the club before but that will not stop the few that are the problem And the older generation say that the millennials are the ones without respect PFFT Also why does this not happen in America Because there are more black people maybe Or maybe because growing up we are taught all about our history and how we need to view each other equally now Not sure but this stuff seems to happen all over the world in soccer except for the United States from what I ve seen And why the fuck is the world cup still gonna be held in Russia lol a bunch of players are planning on boycotting it but the money talks i guess more than the players themselves
A good solution is the real fans putting a stop to that shit as soon as they try it A few saboteurs won t matter if the thousands around don t encourage it or join in If the fans are still such shit people that it just takes a few to stir them up then I don t really care who the ringleader was
Completely right Here in the US if you tried starting a chant like that everyone would look at you like you re crazy and a lot of white people would kick your ass like a few of my friends would Don t know why these fans accept that shit and allow it to taint the whole club s image but you re right if anyone is going to have a significant effect it will the surrounding fans
Idiots will always be idiots Collective punishment isn t just immoral it also doesn t work
The military is so out there in so many different ways it s almost never relevant for normal life I also hope it s more difficult to join a army than go to a football match
However if you re part of a group and someone in that group does something which gets the entire group punished the group is gonna make damn sure that he doesn t do it again If there s 19 of you who behave and one idiot who doesnt there s a lot 19 people can do to get him in line
Exactly I have a feeling that a lot of people would if it had a direct impact on the club itself And if they don t I hope their club fucking rots and dies in the lower leagues because then they deserve everything they get
Hahaha thats complete bullshit and you know it the military MAY be the only place where that shit SOMETIMES works is because many times if someone fucks up someone else dies The fucking stakes are not that god damn high in this situation Also you forget to acknowledge all the fucked up animosity that shit can create what you never saw Full Metal Jacket Act like that shit doesn t happen in real life My buddy in the corps and got fucking drop kicked by a superior literally for no fucking reason Dude had to just stand up and get back in formation Stop talking like the military s old school way of dealing with shit is the solutions to racism is fucking football How drunk are you right now
Believe me when you re out doing PT in the middle of the night because some muppet didn t lock his footlocker and your sergeant took his rifle the whole group is gonna make damn sure that he locks it every time from then on You succeed as a group you are punished as a group Your buddy being drop kicked is utterly irrelevant Had the superior drop kicked every guy in his platoon for something your friend fucked up then you have a comparable scenario What you described isn t Also Full Metal Jacket Because movies always portray real life accurately I m all for trying other things first but if they don t work and they haven t so far you need to escalate Racist supporters Club punishment Club struggles This gives them a choice do I want to be racist or do I want my club to do well It holds them accountable for the clubs survival As it stands they re only accountable if they re caught red handed and from what I understand they rarely are
My military service was in the Norwegian army and I have never been in a life or death situation in my service However I have still witnessed first hand how your teammate fucks up you ve fucked up by letting him fuck up does actually work Your friends situation is irrelevant for the simple reason that he got punished for no reason That s like police arresting some random dude in the stands just because This is completely different from everyone being punished for something he did Of course there has to be an escalation and I m not saying it s applicable to every situation However obviously nothing the Italian FA or Lazio do gets the job done When it comes to Full Metal Jacket in your own words the stakes aren t that high The Lazio fans aren t going to war they re not being shouted at for three months by a snarling spitting drill sergeant We re talking about the possibility of their club being fined If that s enough to push someone over the edge to become a crazed cold blooded murderer they weren t right to begin with
The clubs can do a lot more than that They can keep a data base track and identify people who do it Make sure tickets do not get to these people etc
I ll have to agree Lazio is a repeat offending club should really be hit harder then a 50k slap on the wrist
really nice to see all the kind words on his twitter from fans and people in general https twitter com kkoulibaly26 I think it s something we ll have to deal with until all our older generation europeans are gone we all have them in our families unfortunately Seems society is moving in the right direction with time though
Dude it s not going anywhere any time soon Just look at Reddit
You know whats funny is its the same here American The younger generation is very progressive but the older generation is so stuck in their ways The funny part is that the older generation tells us that our generation is the one with no respect HA
I know we do especially for away games When one of our fans threw a paper bomb at Torino fans last season our club investigated and discovered that the fan was not registered to travel with our away supporters did not have a ticket to the match and was illegally allowed into the stadium Our club argued that they did their due diligence and Torinos stadium security failed to prevent this
I m pretty sure all clubs ban fans for a lifetime when they are caught When there are tens of thousands of fans in a loud stadium it can be difficult to identify who was behind it and it d be a real shitty possibly life ruining mistake to permanently ban a passionate local fan who had nothing to do with the chants just because they were in the general area
That would be very illegal here
In civil court in the US juries often choose to reward massive punitive damage settlements to individuals not to compensate but instead to punish the bad actor that caused the damage The thinking behind this is that money is about the only thing that talks and if you want a business entity s help to change behaviors standards they are at least partially responsible for you hit them where it hurts I think the same idea applies with fines for racist chanting or forcing closed matches to punish the club These punishments hurt club coffers and soccer is a business like any else If racism costs money then we ll be willing to spend some money in programs to prevent it is the underlying cost benefit analysis you want to enable Of course you can t prevent all bad behaviors but clubs ought to be doing more to police their own venues and fans It s 2016 The powers that be ought to at least try to enact a change because this ugliness really takes away from such a beautiful game
Shouldn t matter if he s talented or not or even an athlete He s a human lol
Very true
Lazio has black players too the fans who racially abused Koulibaly must be retarded
Isn t that the case with most racists
Racists are really weird when it comes to their chants and yells I don t have the book with me currently but I remember reading in David Goldblatt s The Game of our Lives in his chapter on racism in English football he quoted an incident from an Arsenal game where some Arsenal fans were racially abusing the opponent s players well within earshot of Ian Wright who was warming up Wrighty looked up to them and one of the fans said something along the lines of Not you Wrighty you re alright before in his next breath continuing to racially abuse the other teams black players So yeah it s a fucking weird thought process amplified by the sometimes aggressive hivemind mentality of a football crowd
That s what I find so ridiculous about it all If I was Wright in that situation or say a black player playing for a Russian club that is playing Zenit and the fans are making monkey chants at Hulk I wouldn t want to play for those supporters I respect the thick skin these guys clearly have I find it admirable in fact but sometimes I wish they d deprive shitty fans of the privilege of watching them play until they learn to behave
There s a segment in Fever Pitch about this exact same thing Idiocy
there is zero logic in racism so yes it totally is
Racism isn t rational
Man Lazio really cant catch a break Even when all those current racist pricks grow up and go on to different things younger racist pricks will have heard of the reputation of Lazio and will join the ranks soon after Cant really see an end to it
you act as if it isnt the general sentiment in the curva They are proud to be racist and fascist
I mean even if the entire ultra culture changed Lazio is still the team of Mussolini and thus the cycle will repeat itself
Lazio was actually the only club to oppose the facists when they wanted to merge all clubs in Rome into one club The other clubs became Roma
Woah woah I m assuming you read the wikipedia because what you commented is word for word But they didn t really oppose the fascists They avoided being merged because they had a Fascist General Giorgio Vaccaro at the head of the club He alone is to thank for that It s not like they said fuck you to the fascists quite the opposite really they had help from the inside of the regime If it wasn t for Vaccaro Lazio would ve merged just the same as the other clubs Tldr Vaccaro was the one who told them to fuck off but he was a fascist general
You re right my bad I just get annoyed when Lazio gets branded the racist and facist club by people
I do agree that the hate Lazio gets is a little undeserved it s become more of a stereotype But you also have to call it like it is sometimes We have a saying in spanish agarra fama y acu state a dormir It means create some fame and go to bed Basically you re doomed by your previous reputation
Its not a racist and fascist club its a racist and fascist curva
Will Lazio be fined for next home game Like empty stadium or so
50 000 euro fine The curva is closed for 2 games The distinti are closed for one game
Thanks
The fine is 50k euros and the curva will be closed for the next two games
Thanks Good to hear
Why do black players agree to join Lazio when the club s supporters are so racist
Thuram famously didn t
Same thing happens in Russia They get convinced to sign this deal that seems much better than their other offers and from a business perspective its usually the right choice Now that I think about it it would probably be a good idea to read what the club s supporting groups are saying about your possible transfer before making it happen I remember reading something from a Zenit or Moscow support group i forget which one telling the admin that they didnt want any black players more or less And then Hulk or someone joined he received abuse from his own supporters So yeah that could be something to check for before signing which im sure no other footballers would have to do which sucks but after his Zenit experience I m sure he ll be more cautious now
Typical Lazio fans
I mean if you take a step back from this and look just at the people doing it it s grown men jumping up and down hooting and hollering What an absolute embarrassment that is
I mean the Curva Nord wasn t even at the game all the Lazio supporter groups on FB are flooded with photos of Koulibaly apologising and saying that they have no part in all of that And this photo in particular http www romapost it wp content uploads 2016 02 keita 700x545 jpg we love all our players and the fans who were making those chants are a disgrace to the rest of us
SS Nazio jokes abound
If I was the Lazio captain manager I d be tempted to just forfeit the game the pricks in the stand don t deserve to watch their team play if they re gonna act like animals make a point that you re not willing to play for them Fair play to the ref though must ve taken balls to do what he did and ultimately was looking out for the players which should be his first and foremost priority
It would send a better message to the fans that the club won t stand for it a message that just accepting punishment from the League UEFA wouldn t send
Lazio should be deducted points
They really shouldn t
They absolutely should Their fans behave like troglodytes far too often the club should start suffering for not doing more to prevent it
And they are as they are forced to pay a 50k euro fine and a section is closed off
So what is stopping these idiots from doing it all over again when the section is open again What are the club doing to ban them It really shouldn t take the governing body to take action Lazio should be taking the strictest possible actions themselves to ban every one of these idiots
I completely agree with you money only harms the people that work for the club and play for the club taking away points hurts the fans hopes and shows them that if they want their team to do well they have to behave If Lazio were a Serie D team then yea 50K would mean something and be harsh but taking away points from a team who s ultras are fascists then you would see a difference
lol no one here gets it These arent a few pricks this is the whole curva Most fans at lazio in the curva are racists and fascists This isnt to insult them they are proud of it So the reason the club doesnt go after them is because if they did they wouldnt have a curva anymore
Yes they should be banned but it really isn t so easy but Lazio should do everything in their power to do it My only point is that Lazio shouldn t be deducted points for something they can t 100 control
And his point is that these punishments need to be made even more severe until this bullshit stops
I agree that the punishments could be more severe 50k euro is nothing But point deduction is not the way to do it
Some people come to games just to be assholes Why should a club be penalized for the crowd taking a mob mentality and doing stuff like this I just don t like point deductions for something that had nothing to do with play in the field My point is the people that do this could probably care les about a point deduction they aren t the most intelligent
Few things the club doesn t own its supporters and doesn t own the stadium There s not a whole lot the Club can do except denouncing the idiots who do this The prefect of Rome tried to add more security to the stadium and his measures led to fan protests somewhat justifiable too from both Lazio and Roma fans to the point that 50 of the stadium has been empty for over 3 months now Now I m not saying the club has zero responsibility but I m not sure they have enough for points deduction here
I don t agree with point deduction but a club can do more than just denouncing the supporters I don t know if Lazio is already doing this but they can implement a system of cameras which is able to identify abusive fans and press charges against them if the behaviour is severe enough
That seems like such an easy thing to do Too easy Here in America at least there are cameras on every street corner in every parking lot and in every building The fact that these people cant afford a simple camera system that watches the crowd is ridiculous of course they could implement that The question is why haven t they
The ref whas dumb he stopped 2 minutes then continued made it only worse should have stopped the match permanently

Did FSG update the site Cos right now it says turning consumers into fans
PR Disaster makes you move fast
yea they changed it
Pathetic glad they got caught out
The OP isn t real Their marketing website has nothing to do with Liverpool
FSM is owned by FSG They are not directly linked with LFC but they are connected
That means jack shit Nobody working on the FSM website has any contact with the higher ups at FSG it s literally just a throwaway marketing slogan on a random web page
Obviously a mistake No one is that thick
You d be surprised
Is this about the fine bros
yeah I assume they are Americans
American ownership of sports franchises has evolved to this level of thickness It s unbelievable what they do to fans here in the USA I m not surprised its picked up in England
That s too much of a blanket statement for Corporate America It works for sports but honestly with the 2 big banks and now a private equity firm its been pretty great Gracious with time off benefits negotiation of title changes and salary they ve been incredibly upfront and honest in many respects Really the only problem I ve had is them determining bonuses salary for the employees that work for me even with my reviews and assessments I know I m a minority but you re making a gross generalization
They definitively are our fans have been asking them to drop ticket prices for nearly a year and a half and they upped the majority of them
Which I must assume was what it was meant to say the entire time I mean in fear of sounding naive that s what companies want Consumers are good fans are great
It doesn t really make sense that way round though In the context of a football club you re not really gonna have many customers who aren t fans You ll have millions of fans who aren t customers though
Not really it s easy to be a fan I m a fan of my club but I m barely a consumer
You can see it here https web archive org web 20150623192413 http www fenwaysportsmanagement com portfolio
Can someone actually confirm and prove that this was real and not photoshopped please Everyone in this thread is jumping on the same bandwaggon while many who are claiming it was photoshopped are being downvoted Plus on their actual website it says Customers to Fans whereas what s linked by OP is simply a screenshot So yeah can someone prove it s not photoshopped please Did some digging and apparently in June 2015 it did say Fans into Customers which is pretty fucking embarrasing

Yeah I just saw that from the other thread I was skeptical at first and thought it was shopped because I didn t think anyone would be that stupid to put that slogan on their website Sadly it seems I was wrong
You are naive if you think LFCs owners are the only ones who think like that
But you re also punching yourself in the balls if you say it out loud Everyone thinks someone they know is a bellend but only a true bellend says that in a public forum where he s also the audience
Exactly It just shows ignorant contempt for the fans that you re proudly gloating about exploiting the loyalty of these people into hard cash for yourself At least pretend you understand the soul of the club and you re all in it together
Shhh nobody can sell pitchforks if you put logic into this E
I like how fans of every other team are downvoting you for saying that Newsflash any team that isn t some usually corrupt billionaire s prestige project is a business that s run with the same general goals
Or in our case owned by a consortium of local boys done good who are fans of the club and have its best interests at heart
with a 36 side helping of Yank cash
Well now yes Although given they ve been very clear about Parish remaining in charge of decision making and such I m rather pleased with them Seem to have their heads screwed on
agreed You never know what the future may bring though
There s a difference between running a club like a business with goals to maintain financial stability and make profit and what some other clubs are doing namely bleeding the fans dry Bayern Munich is a prime example Run like a business on a sensible financial footing but with respect to the fans that make up the backbone of the club
We still have some time left with Bill and the board who judging by their marketing techniques don t care at all about earning money or getting new customers
It s exactly what our CEO said a few weeks back She also said that our feeling of ownership of the club was weird
I think the point is that it s not smart to express it openly In front of investors in a semi private show sure In the public website not so much
it s not like we need to make money is a secret it s literally the prime directive for capitalism turning fans into customers is marketing 101 this is not secret philosophy
Isn t that the whole idea of sponsorship everywhere
Well that is what they are no
Yep exactly It s all just semantics I don t see the outrage we are customers and people need to accept that
I can t believe this got in the news it s obviously just marketing bollocks for sponsors who cares Be outraged at the real outrage
If it was about high ticket prices being beyond the reach of everyday fans then it could make sense and sound good As in These prices are so low anyone can afford them We re turning all our fans into customers rather than just the wealthy That would have maybe worked Maybe
Knowing someone that works in marketing my bet would be that someone THOUGHT this would play well Most likely an older PR person Then it backfired and they had to backtrack I ve seen a lot of older PR work that doesn t click in the 21st century I m glad they were called out on this though
I don t think it s that I mean look where it is Under the sales representation section of the portfolio page on the Fenway Sports Management website I doubt anybody ever thought this would play well with fans they just didn t think about how it would play with fans at all because it s they were focusing on something that will play well with business people

Autocorrectc s
It s a poor choice of words not some nefarious plan that we weren t meant to catch on to And I don t see how this is bragging it s a line on their corporate website
In a day and age where most people misappropriate their digital media companies outlook should be trying to turn fans into customers as most fans think they re above paying for media
If the Yankees Detroit Red Wings Steelers or some other storied US sports team had leaked something similar people here would not even treat that as news It s taken for granted that these are businesses now
This reminds me of Stephanie McMahon s Philanthropy is a the future of marketing tweet Sure deep down everyone knows its true but it makes you sound really scummy if you say it Although with Steph she s supposed to be a bad guy so maybe we were worked
I think what some of these owners don t realize is the power of the 12th man AKA the crowd If you fuck your fans over you will destroy the atmosphere in your ground I think a great crowd and an atmosphere can drive your team and actually win you more points over a season This week in Alan Davies Tuesday Club podcast they talked about this in relation to Arsenal but also touched on Liverpool and Man Utd as well Here s the link to the podcast He starts by mentioning the atmosphere at the Arsenal ground at about 15 20 and then mentions Liverpool at 17 10
Dear Liverpool fans Welcome to life under Fenway Sports Group You will be fleeced for every penny you have or you will look on from the outside Your traditions will be raped for the sake of commercialization and profit and your hallowed old stadium will become a shallow refuge of bandwaggoners and suit wearing corporate asshats Believe me I d know Sincerely a Boston Red Sox fan ps At least we ve been appeased somewhat with three World Series titles in a decade So that makes the corporate assault of our traditions a little better But not much
On the flipside you guys finally won a championship right
Did you guys just sign a guy on a 217 million dollars deal correct me if im wrong but thats pretty good investment
What do you think they re smoking over there at Fenway
Fucking awful
serves you well for selling your clubs to foreigners left and right
You could argue that FSG are really just being loyal to the basis that the club was founded on to make money
Sure but McDonalds slogan isn t let s get filthy rich even though that s their aim

You dont belong at any club unless you follow the orders systen of the manager in charge
What about AVB at Chelsea with Terry and Lampard
That happens a lot at clubs with superstar players The manager can t handle their egos and things quickly spiral out of control as a result Look at Klinsmann with Bayern Moyes with United Benitez with Real Madrid And AVB didn t exactly endear himself to the players if the stories about him taking down pictures celebrating the team s achievements under Ancelotti and the forced hug are true
It s the reason Louis van Gaal has so many star players on his shitlist Instead of letting things spiral entirely out of control he finds it easier to get rid of them rather than tolerate their bullshit
Yeah but fuck AVB I m sure you re a lot happier with your current manager than him
You could say that
Imagine Pochettino with Bale
Tbf I think AvB did an absolutely excellent job when it came to using Bale Just because Pochettino is seeminly better at other aspects of management doesn t mean he d have done better with Bale than AvB did
Yeah so Whatever you think of the manager it is a matter of principle regardelss of who is appointed
Basically if ElDingus is right in that Terry and Lampard helped get AVB out then we have to make a decision Either side with the Chelsea boys or AVB There s no way of telling who was in the right or wrong AVB might have been worse than Mourinho towards the players Who knows I ll side with Terry and Lampard who are natural leaders If I m wrong then I m wrong There is just too much information missing to make a great decision so I m going with that one
How about not making a decision if there s heaps of information missing Seems more reasonable
deleted
Was on camera loads if times during games when they kept instructing the players and even AVB from the bench
That happened once under DiMatteo in the Napoli game Only John Terry could possible be criticised for trying to help his team from the sidelines
Agreed but often it s a case of selling that idea to the players and having them all buy it this is where many managers struggle The vision and idea might be perfect but getting people on board can be hard work if you can t communicate it in terms of words and results
Exactly and Pochettino has been fucking ruthless with it Even his own signings have been kicked out if they don t fit Stambouli s arse barely evengot out of his plane seat
Funny how this is upvoted until Valdes goes against LVG and then it s all about what a cunt of a club and cunt of a manger we are
Wasn t the talk mostly about how LVG went about getting rid of Valdes announcing it at a press conference
Well the players should follow instructions but the coach has to sell it too When rumors abound that you ve lost the dressing room it s only normal that people start doubting whether you re a suitable person to be leading the team
None of the other Man Utd players have any problems with LvG s stance on reserve team football
and the Valdes fallout happened towards the end of the last season when there was no talk of losing the dressing room That guy has no valid points
There s not even talk about him losing the dressing room now even The players seem to have his back despite the media hounding him for months
Yeah because we all know the dressing problems history that Ponchettino has Oh wait that is LVG so no surprise people are against him
So its one rule for one and another for another Great input
If that is what you got from that then you are an idiot
Chelsea players disagree Time and time again they ve tried to prove they re bigger than the manager AVB and Mou are two examples of that happening
Really impressed with Spurs this season You can t doubt Pochettino s credentials as a top manager now He took Southampton to the next level and he s taking Spurs to the next level now I only hope that Spurs stadium redevelopment doesn t dampen their performance like it did with Arsenal for a decade because I doubt Pochettino will hang around to steady the ship on a shoestring budget like Wenger did I hope he takes Spurs to the next level and turns them into contenders for the Premier League and I m interested to see how they fare in the Champions League next season
Imagine if a full changing of the guard took place Man city already took Liverpools spot Leicester for Chelsea spurs for Arsenal and someone for man United probably Southampton because they re pretty cool
I reckon arsenal would still cling to 4th they ve got a couple of mesmeric players
And Chelsea don t Lol
I feel like Hazard and Willian are their only standout players Who can tell with Costa Dave too Fine they have plenty just feels like they don t right now
Courtios Zouma
Matic Fabregas
Begovic Oscar Before this season our players were considering world class A run of bad admittedly god awful form and all of a sudden we re a League One side
Arsenal would have to completely collapse post Wenger for that to happen
That s not really out of the realm of possibilities Looking at United post Fergie they could go through a similar rough period of time once Wenger decides to hang it up
I can t see Wenger leaving the same shambles of a team as Fergie did Sure they won the league but just look at that squad with van Persie out of god mode
Shambles that win the league with 5 games spare Moyes greatest achievement is convincing the world that he inherited a poor side
I felt had I addressed that already Just look at Chelsea this season things can change over a summer You hadn t had a proper midfield for four years and with van Persie unable to carry on in his stalwart form it finally showed
Yeah the side was great and it s not fergie s fault that moyes failed so dramatically in the summer transfer market
Not Fergies fault it s stupid to blame him but I think people forget what a difficult task Moyes had How many of the players did Moyes inherit who are still in the team He had a massive rebuilding task and he didn t get given the time money or expertise to do a good job
O god yes please
Bit of a coin toss really
We ve only finished 6th once in the last 6 seasons and have finished 4th or 5th in 7 of the last 10 seasons I don t necessarily think we re going to be consistently winning the league or anything but we ve been pretty consistent for awhile now
Just ignore these people Most of the time they get biased like hell and it s ridiculous You guys are playing fantastically Now go on and get relegated please
No fair you have a head start
We ve spent 53m in the last 5 years Spending can t get worse
Yeah we re already on the shoestring
I imagine it might curve spending a little bit But with a manager like Poch we aren t going to be spunking massive amounts on players anyway The difference between when Arsenal did the Library and us doing our new stadium are quite big the new TV money is obviously a huge boost but we also have the NFL deal
curb spending
Curve kinda works too though haha
Helps that you got a world record fee for a player
We already spent that money and wasted it tho
Not all of it Eriksen has definitely been worth at least twice his price and lamela has come good
Chadli has been extremely solid too Capoue wasn t even bad for us either just didn t fit under Poch I d say that our window turned out to be fine much less worse than everyone seems to think
Levy also made 2m on Stambouli and recouped almost all of the cost of Paulinho Capoue and Chiriches
Yeah soldodo just flopped so bad he stood out Also lamela started pretty bad so that idea remains
Paulinho as well who I d argue flopped as badly as Soldado Liverpool s spending of the Suarez money seems to be worse though yet spurs are always talked about as the pinnacle of failed transfer windows Lallana Lovren Markovic Balotelli Moreno Can Lambert is a pretty poor window as well
Yeah that is way worse
No you didn t Any players you bought with the Bale money and sold on afterwards is money directly related to Bale The money you got from selling likes of Paulinho Chiriche Capoue and Soldado is related to Bale since they were bought with his money then you have the fact that even with those factored in you had about 10million of Bale money left over So with the transfer fees you got for those players and the 10million you had left over that summer from Bale he s netted you something like 40million Take that away and you re in the red like everyone else Then you have Chadli Lemela and Eriksen who you still have a play
And all he signs is kids The stadium has been well planned for imo
should bloody hope so tbh The plans for it originally came out almost 10 years ago
Everyone in the league gets more or less the same TV money so it s irrelevant And the TV money won t help you compete with the likes of Madrid Barca Bayern etc NFL deal is also being trumped up massively It s going to be what 2 3 games a season It s not significant in this day and age
There s a lot more to it than just match day revenue
List them Take a rough estimation of how much money they ll bring in Go on Match day revenue is by far and way the biggest and it s still pennies Anything else will be laughable insignificant
Well the biggest the NFL one of the biggest sports organisations on the planet paying us for the right to play in our stadium Concerts make stadiums a significant amount too
He was also amazing with Espanyol
He started off well but he eventually got sacked amazing is a stretch
I think he s very good but you can t call someone who hasn t won anything a top manager So far he hasn t proven himself at the very highest level like the Champions League
going to be a cracking match in a few weeks defoe s miss a few years ago at the etihad still haunts me
Do you think Martinez is a top manager What about Laudrup Or Gary Monk They all took their relative teams to the next level I agree that Poch seems to do differently than the ones I mentioned but he s yet to achieve anything extraordinary to cement himself as a top manager Consistently is a big feature for a top manager esp the ones with convictions like Poch s Or maybe my standards are not reasonable
He could have picked any season he liked and he chose the last one Nobody called for Pochs head it was pretty universal we would be content with Europa as long as we saw stability
http talksport com football pochettino out tottenham fans call managers head 141026120914
What a pathetic article It s actually basing that on select tweets from fools Surely you aren t foolish enough to use Twitter as an appropriate gauge for fan opinion
You re talking to a guy who can t get through a discussion without calling someone a retard or telling people to kill themselves He s a waste of time even when he does stumble upon a good point
I mean he s right Wilshere is regularly England s best player and Drinkwater has never been good enough for England
If you look through his comment history he s gobbling Wilshere s knob incessantly and shitting on Spurs I only attempt to point that out to put his analysis on Spurs here in context
I don t agree with some of his points but I don t really think that statement is outlandish by any means Sure you can doubt wilshere is England s best player but he s definitely better than Drinkwater
I don t even think you can doubt that Wilshere is England s best player He s outstanding every time he plays for England while very few others step up bar like Welbeck and Hart
Really hard to be considered England s best player when you re hurt so damn often
I d rather have an on form Drinkwater than Wilshere on crutches though which seems to be his default state at this point
You can tell r soccer is predominantly made up of people who have followed the sport for barely any time at all if they believe shit like Drinkwater being a better player than Wilshere and that Spurs are now a world beating team
Buddy judging on the last few months Drinkwater has been outstanding and Wilshire has been on the injury list Also Wilshire s record for England is very very poor for someone to proclaim him England s best player At this point I d probably say that s Joe Hart as the only consistent performer for England over the last 3 years
I mean we are saving the national team Have you heard about our Lord and savior Harry Kane and his prophets Eric Dier and Dele Alli
Wilshere has been great for England but you can t count on him to be healthy so everyone is right to start looking at alternatives
Yeah if he can finish the season fit and performs to standard then by all means tally him up in the team sheet but I don t think it s stupid at all to consider someone that s been on form all season like Drinkwater over Wilshere if he can t even string two months without injury together to end the season
Don t see a struggle when we built the stadium for them especially if we get Dele Alli s
I m honestly expecting Real or Manchester City to make up most of the 150 million pounds or so that are still needed for the stadium
There are though Lloris Toby himself Eriksen and Kane
Is that an indirect to anyone or just the general phrase you hear everywhere
Addressed to the league as a whole You fuck with Poch you re relegated Something like that
You mean transfer there from Southampton
And that s why Tottenham are doing so well this year I d go as far as to say that Pochettino is the best BPL manager this season
Ranieri
Definitely Ranieri I love Poch but what Ranieri s done with Leicester is unprecedented
It s so ridiculous that even feels unrealistic With Pochettino it s easy to say see here s what he did in Southampton here s the results this lead to here s what he is doing at Tottenham and we re currently seeing the results of that With Ranieri it s like see he made Leicester fight for the title And it s so unbelievable that it s almost easier to say nah it s just a lucky set of circumstances
It s not even that for me Even if you believed in Ranieri s quality as a manager it s still fucking ridiculous When people argue that Guardiola and Mourinho are overrated managers because they ve never taken a weaker team to silverware they mean like a Tottenham Liverpool Everton tier team Ranieri is doing that with a team that was pipped for relegation This season is all of my what Ranieri is literally working miracles before our eyes Water into wine is one thing Leicester City into title contenders is another thing entirely
I guess you should look up Mourinhos history at Uni o de Leiria which ultimately landed him the Porto job
Then you would have guessed wrong I think framing it as other people s arguments should have made it pretty fucking clear that I m not in that camp I m not the person you need to be telling this
After re reading your comment I suppose you are right Have an internet apology
You realize that Spurs have finished above Everton and Liverpool for the past 5 6 years right
They ve also generally finished in very similar league position Which is why I said tier As in the group of teams that tend to finish in the spots just outside CL qualification If you re not going to group Spurs with Everton Liverpool where are you going to group them With the regular top 4 I m a Tottenham fan but that s still ridiculous until Spurs make it back to the CL
He s just kept Leicester performing at the level Pearson had them at since January 2015 I ve got no idea what s going on at that club
drugs I mean just look at Vardy he s on something recreational if nothing else
That s my secret I m always off my nut
in all seriousness he has a ridiculous amount of energy for a 29 year old I m 30 and can barely walk without pain
I think that has to do with not playing regular high level football until he was a little older than other top players Look at Carlos Bacca for another example Another 29 year old that keeps running around fine too Not the same speed as Vardy of course
In any other season easily but when Leicester fuck City are sitting top in February the other managers are just competing for silver
give it 2 years and he ll be sacked for finishing 6th
I m honestly so impressed you ve got 12 000 comment karma i ve never seen one of your comments above 0
He s one big bitch
Who gives a fuck about karma
At the end of the season I will be proven right yet again Spurs fans are so deluded it s unbelievable
You are obsessed with Tottenham Just come out as a fan already
Sounds awful cultish Path to Pochettino s Gate like
Tottenham isn t a cult it s a mob family Toby is just Don Pochettino s enforcer
He ll have a self portrait in his house next
Really totalitarian huh
There s no other way to prevent big egos and dressing room revolts Players should always have massive respect for the manager because 9 times out of 10 they know better Pochettino has established a perfect hierarchy at Spurs
It s a football team not a country

Sure and while we are at it contact Ayala to replace Abdennour in defence
Also Baraja and Albelda in midfield Morientes and Villa in attack Contact them all
Canizares Angloma Ayala Pellegrino Carboni Baraja Mendieta Angulo Aimar Vicente Mista Palop Torres Bjorklund Djukic Aurelio Albelda Sissoko Rufete Zahovic Kily Carew To bad Benitez had two teams better than the team we have now
Good old times
Where s Joaquin
He wasn t there during the Benitez era Still on Betis Benitez left in 2005 i think
Didn t Vicente end up with you guys at some point
Gaizka was there too or did he left before that
I may have fucked up with Mendieta as I see he left the same summer Benitez took over just as Zahovic did so throw in Juan Sanchez and Carlos Marchena who I completely forgot instead
You left out Aimar you philistine
Mendieta is still around as well
Villa would still be better than Negredo and Rodrigo
Has he been that shit We were linked with him in the summer and I was pretty gutted he ended up not coming
Boumsong Bramble and Ramage laugh when they see Abdennour defend
fuck me didnt know he was THAT bad what happened to him wasnt he solid in Monaco
Some players can play solid even when the rest of the team is shite Abdennour doesn t seem to be one of these players
That s sad he was great for Monaco and their team clearly took a dive defensively when he left
I thought he looked solid in the only match I watched vs Barcelona I guess that was just a 1 of
Abdennour is like Rami was before him He looks brilliant but then you watch the highlights and realize how often he is involved when the opponent scores has chances And a lot of what he does good is to fix up in his own errors And terrible with the ball in his feet mixed with a lack of understanding of his own terribleness
So Benitez comes back to Valencia and the first person to greet him is Cheryshev Benitez is like OMG no no no NOOOOOO wakes up in cold sweat
https www youtube com watch v 31g0YE61PLQ
Would be a great choice for Benitez Given the dreadful performances of Valencia this season I think he will be cut a lot of slack if he fails There is way less pressure there compared to Real Madrid
This seems both believable and probable Means it won t go down
Benitez is an improvement obviously but he s washed up hasn t adapted to this generation All you have to do is look at how napoli and madrid are doing without him I would just scrap this season and try to get Pelligrini Talk about someone who deserves job stability
Pelligrini would be interesting at Valencia
Sure
same ol coaching shuffle top kek
What are the odds we hire Benitez and buy Cheryshev from Madrid and win the league next year with Cheryshev our top scorer I d kill to see the faces of Madrid fans I really hope we don t hire Benitez it s not 2005 anymore I want either J mez Sampaoli or Quique Flores
Watch Benitez Valencia beat us
Valencia vs Spain
madrid
that would be something
With Cheryshev scoring a last minute goal Absolute scenes
Cheryshev won t be allowed to play against Madrid
Rules haven t stopped him before
That s an actual clause
Yes especially after the whole Morata thing complicated by Juve being Italian Perez is always going to have a clause saying the player cannot play against Madrid In the last game vs Espanyol both Marco Ansensio and Burgui both on loan from RM were not allowed to play
Does that stupid rule also exists in Spain
It s not a rule as much as just something some teams do
How is that rule stupid It s obviously a conflict of interest to play against the team that you re under contract for
It destroys the integrity of the league if Valencia can play Cheryshev against every other team but not against Real Madrid
Not really how is that remotely true Just play another player
How is it stupid lol Why would the parent club let their own player play against them
Experience And other clubs dictating your line up against them is stupid If a player throws a game because he plays against his parent club then he will not go far in this sport Those people are professionals You should estimate that they act like one But i understand that the English audience doesn t get why it s a stupid rule
I wasnt suggesting that the player would throw the game more that the parent club would not like to be knocked out of a cup or lose an important match because their own player scored
Dude what is wrong with you Why would you try to bring that bad juju on us
Football is cyclical
I love both Valencia and Benitez but Benitez will risk to tarnished his memorable status among the fans there I saw Valencia play against Real Madrid the other day and i doesnt understand the hate for the team They wasnt that bad to me They had potential but low on confidence and lack of concentration at times This is due to form rather than quality of the players My only complained based on Real Madrid games is their midfield that need to be sorted out asap They should ve had more control of the game in the middle of the park rather than spending a lot of time in the final third not finishing chances and get caught off guard by instant transition of attack by the opposition and drain their energy by tracking back because their midfield and defense unable to handle the movement of opposing team Getting G Neville there is a disastrous i think because he wanted to implemented the Ferguson s way of playing but that couldnt work well there at Spain Same as Klopp s trying to play his agrresive pressing style but the players just cant keep it and it wouldnt do with most Premier League except the possibility of the club that exposed to continental style of football via Cl such as Man City Chelsea or Arsenal I heard they try to get Pellegrini and i think he is the better option for Valencia than Rafa Benitez but i ll be very happy if Rafa back at Mestalla though
Nah man they just need a pundit from another country What about a German pundit instead
Lol so he can field an ineligible Cheryshev once more in next year s Copa del Rey
That wasn t his fault at least not fully
Cheryshev won t be there next year
LOL L O L Hope the Fax Machine works over there
You guys ship the fax machine between Madrid and Valencia when someone is expecting a fax
deleted
He wasn t utter shit He was poor for Real Madrid standards but if you want to talk about utter shit that s Gary Neville and Nuno Benitez is leagues above both of them as a manager
What a crazy hyperbole he wasn t great but you re talking about a man who got sacked 2 weeks after winning a game 10 2
He was not utter shite He was just not Real Madrid level He will do fine at Valencia
Real Madrid level What the fuck does that mean Given time Rafa could have done wonders with that team And as if Zidane is Real Madrid level STFU
I didnt say he is a bad coach but it was obvious he isnt the best at the moment plus you know F Perez he is not the most patient man in the world Benitez didnt do wonders with Napoli didnt do wonders with Chelsea and didnt do wonders with Inter Real Madrid is not the club to slowly build up your reputation No results means you are done Dont fking STFU me yes i remember he won Champions League 11 years ago with you
Real Madrid is a world class team Real Madrid level World class manager Rafa Benitez is not a world class manager

Now thats a good fact
He went to Inter won their first European Cup
First and second actually
Yes When Real Madrid and Benfica were downed
Won Euro 1964 with Spain Won the Ballon d Or
Only Spaniard with a Ballon D Or
Luis Suarez is clearly a good name to have for soccer
Ronaldo Suarez
Pele Savage
There s probably several hundred kids named Ronaldo Messi
We have a player in our academy called Ronaldo Viera
Might be Ronaldo Vieira If he s Brazilian that s a rather common name
Ah yes he is I think he has a brother called Romario too
we needed to sell him to pay Camp Nou
He does the barca games for cadena ser But maybe with him Barca wouldn t be the same as they are today They might have ruled europe for a bit back then but they might no have brought on Cruyff the next decade as Luis Suarez might have change that long drought Barca was having
I know If any of the MSN leave it ll be because of this incompetent board
now in the newspapers the dad of neymar says he has an offer for 180m
They say whatever they want cause Neymar wants a new and better contract which he will get But he won t stay forever with Barca I m sure he ll be gone in 4 5 years
You can go to a better club than barca
Possibly in the future no one knows but he can get more money in china doe
Jesus dude Neymar will never leave Europe you have no idea what the fuck youre talking about Leave Barca Maybe But only to go to an equally recognized team While MSN is all there however i really do not see any of the three wanting out Theyre playing in the best squad they will ever play in with some or their closest friends MSN was a genius investment by Barca and I think theyre practically priceless at this point
The thing called future is never certain dude what if china able to offer 5x the wage barca able to give I don t say he will but the possibility is there I never want to say anything for certain because anything is possible
If Brazil wins the World Cup in 2018 I can see Neymar leaving Europe after that
Wtf are you talking about Neymar will never leave europe Wasnt Kaka the best player in the world at some point What about Ronaldinho Didnt they both leave Europe for all we know Neymar becomes shit at 28 and wants to retire in Brazil or even making a shit ton of money in China dont talk about the future like youre certain of it m8
Many people said the exact same about the line up that beat United in Wembley But Messi Pedro Villa hit their highpoint at that exact moment You never know what will happen in future I really can t see Neymar being happy for too long at not being THE focal point There are plenty of clubs would build everything around him and make him the face of their club
I can t stand his father
The Sun oh please It will be a case when his contract ends
he said that to the judge it is now in a lot of newspapers
But Inter cheated
Wonder if anyone actually checks these facts I might start making some up to find out
We should have Neil DeGrasse Tyson say it to us so it sounds cooler
Truly the most astounding fact
is the knowledge
He d just spoil it with a series of tweets about how scientifically unrealistic it is
At this moment I m euphoric not because this is a very specific fact but it s also a good fact
who is this bloke I see his name mentioned on this site all the time
or jonathan frakes
I love a good TNG reference D
actually that was a Beyond Belief Fact or Fiction reference
What the Fact
how do we know this is true wheres the source
You should know better He s an Inter legend after all
The only spanish player to win the ballon d or What an honour to be named Luis Suarez
Luis Suarez on Luis Suarez With that name he can t go wrong
No way proof
Back then and nowadays with Iniesta by his side
Miramontes is such a cool name
Literally means Hill spotter
I think you could stylize it as Mountainseer and at that point he becomes a wizard
Iniesta isn t even the youngest looking person in that pic
Alfredo Di St fano Twice
He was born in Argentina
He had Spanish citizenship when he won it though and won it as a Spanish player Messi was the first to get one for Argentina
Well you can argue that of course but I was referring to spanish players that were born in Spain Nevertheless Di Stefano arrived to Spain when he was 27yo I would even consider Messi s awards as spanish before than Di Stefano s
I agree with you on which country he should have won it for I m just stating what s in the record book
You re right and therefore I agree
lol so he s still argentinian getting a citizenship doesn t change the place u were born
It s also doesn t change the fact that Spain are down as having 3 wins because of him I agree that it s silly But it s what happened
Maradona also won it and he did it before Messi
Maradona never won it it was only available to European players for a long time hence why Pel never won it too
He didn t
Are you sure about that Do you want to have a little Google and come back
Why the downvotes Back then only Europeans were eligible for Ballon D or so Di Stefano is considered a Spanish recipient He was also playing for the Spain national team at the time I believe
Does this confirm Suarez is a vampire tho
Nah just a regen
I m pretty sure that s been already confirmed a while ago now
Moral of the story Always sign players named Luis Suarez oh and name your kids that
Hi my name is Frank Shaw This is my son Luis Suarez
Not really relevant but that reminded me of Frankie Shaw who is really fit
His father named him Luis because his favorite player was 1956 Suarez
Really
I doubt that current Suarez s father remembers anything from 1956
Why not Suarez kept on playing for Inter Milan until 1970 Suarez 2 0 s father could ve easily seen the player play
Exactly That s only 17 years before Luis Suarez was born I have clear vivid memories from the 1980s let alone 17 years ago
Why wouldn t he
Not 1957 Suarez Much better imo
Vintage Suarez
Rare Suarez
Nah Luis is very common and his last name is also very common in Uruguay
Yeah it s probably a coincidence Luis is a ridiculously common name about a quarter of the latinos I knew growing up myself included are named Luis
Forza Luis Suarez Won Internazionale our 1st European Cup Legend of the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza forever
1st and 2nd and only ones until Mourinho 2010
He has a pretty good claim to be the better Luis Suarez Wish there was more recorded football from back then so I could see all of them from more than just highlight reels
He was the worlds best midfielder in the early 60s and is usually considered to be one of the best if not the most influential 10 20 midfielders of all time by experts journalists ex players Nicknamed Luisito or more famously the architect he was praised for his incredible passing and his elegant and fluent movement on the pitch Starting out on the inside left spot on midfield at Barca he evolved the role of play maker and attacking midfielders when Herrera moved him closer to the opponents box Before that play makers would typically just distribute balls from midfield Barca and especially Inter where he perfected his play style were able to keep possession close to goal passing and exploring defenses looking for a weak spot He was Herreras pupil at Barcalona and when he left for Italy Suarez would be one of his first and most prominent signings His transfer to Inter made him the most expensive player in the world for a while and it was the start of Herreras legendary Inter side that would dominate the 60s He stayed with Inter until 1970 despite offers from other great club sides that were emerging finally leaving when he was 35 years old and declining He played another 3 seasons with Sampdoria before he had to retire because his knees were gone In the end he couldnt run anymore and would only walk during games but his passing and positioning were still sublime
Luis Su rez is often mentioned in debates about the best Spanish player of all time
7 3 against Atletico Madrid
of course it had to be us
Must have been a heck of a match 10 goals total
Hah I ll use this one next time Remember that amazing game between United and Arsenal back in the days 10 goals total
what game
I 8 2 break it to you like this
Whoa when did this game happen
Same day Man City won 5 1 against you on WHL if I remember correctly
He did not ask you to tell him that
He got the reply he deserved not the one he needed
Isn t that the joke That he purposely forgot that day Or am I giving him too much credit
Probably but I don t know if that many actually remembers that Spurs lost with 5 1 against City that day so I figured it would be fun to point out regardless
a long long time after your 9 1
google is your friend
last week
2010 11 or 2011 12 Am not sure jist woke up
deleted
I guess you weren t around at the time The 8 2 jokes got old real fast never seen a joke get overused to that extent
deleted
Oh trust me we remember
Love a reverse woosh
Atleast arsenal fans have the Reading game
That s something Feyenoord fans can use too
The most impressive thing is that they still have the minute marked for every goal over 60 years later
The other Lionel Messi
Not Albert Einstein
God damn illuminati shit right there
More like a glitch in the matrix
Well this confirms it Luis Suarez is a vampire
2freaky4me
6spooky2B
Started reading oh great another Barcelona fact i thought to myself But wait a minute plot twist What an ending Now that s a fun fact
Illuminati confirmed
Miramontes I assume
Yes
Barcelona just can t seem to get enough
now thats a TIL worthy
What if Luis Suarez is being named after this Luis Suarez Mind fucked
Does this confirm Suarez is a very specific fact but it s also a good fact
Spooky
WTF
Illuminati confirmed
It was meant to be
You fuckin with me right
And so it goes
Time is cyclical and not linear
Great scott
Great shitfact OP
A man named Luis Suarez Well that man won a Ballon D Or It seems that for some people soccer was invented after they started watching it for the first time Just hard to believe that the OP has no clue who that player was
What s with all of those new record posts that keep popping up Ala Cristiano just scored two goals against Cadiz now he s the first player from Real Madrid to score two goals against them twice blah blah I mean knock yourselves out some of them are interesting to read and some others not so much
This one is definitely interesting though
I agree This one was interesting though In other cases you can basically make up any record as soon as someone scores against another team

What a waste
What the fuck
I guess he was happy going anywhere that wasn t Donetsk
Well yeah we knew that but China
It s a nice place to live now Especially if you re a millionaire
I ll live in Syria for 50m shieeet
I think he just wanted to make sure he d get a big wage bump just in case he regresses in the next few months or years
The money these Chinese teams are spending is amazing
Yeah it s not so much the sums themselves every now and then you see a club pop up with an outrageous fee it s that so many of them are doing it and over such a short period It s crazy
Is this even true Does anyone speak Portuguese I can t see any quotes on the page either A tell tale sign for sifting through the shit posting of football gossip
There isn t a quote they say it s a done deal but there is no confirmation yet Ojogo is legit they are the best sports related newspaper in Portugal
Translate app on phone says PLAY is able to guarantee first hand that the transfer has taken place
theplay pt
Yeah forgot the O or something while copying
Wow Imagine the money some of these clubs would pay for Messi or Neymar if they were up for sale
A Russian team tried to buy Messi a few years ago I think it was Anzhi makachalakakalkcha I think they met his buy out clause
Former home of Eto o Roberto Carlos Willian and Diarra
deleted
No it didn t
they are playing with monopoly money they could trigger buy out clauses for any player in the world its just a matter if the player would actually go over there highly unlikely
Even PSG could do that I remember Barcelona tried to bid for someone Marquinhos I think and PSG rejected it and triggered Messi s release clause in response
I remember that one time I was on a train in Nanjing Jiangsu Boarded in Shanghai on my way to Beijing Felt like a boss having argued my way with a drawn out episode of charades into getting a ticket on the sold out train Then I realized the ticket I was given was for standing only 18 hours on a sold out Chinese train Without a seat Already wanted to kill myself by the time I reached Nanjing
What an absolute waste of talent Its not like he d be earning pennies in the Prem at Liverpool he d probably be on about 120k a week
He wanted to join Liverpool I m sure he had little say in this It was the club Jiansu is offering more than LFC
I m sure he wasn t forced to leave either
The player has to agree to individual terms before a sale goes through The club can accept any fee they want
Exactly so ultimately he chose to go to China even if he did prefer Liverpool he could ve held out or could ve gone a step further in terms of unprofessionalism if he was that desperate to leave
Yeah but it could have easily been the club forcing him to go saying something like they wont play him or block moves in the future etc Its not always the players that are in the wrong Maybe he will go for a year then try and leave China who knows Seems he either just REALLY wanted out of Shaktar or was forced out for whatever reason they wanted the money NOW etc
Shaktar would probably not get a better offer so tbh it was smart of them to accept it and force him out since he s been blabbering about leaving for a while He s only 25 so he might just spend one year in China make that Friend s money and come back to Europe
I wouldn t blame him for trying to get out of Ukraine
I didn t understand Liverpool wanting to sign him their problems are at the back
You never know though as unlikely as this sounds he could be going to China in a deal that benefits everyone China get more exposure from signing a big name player then they sell him to Liverpool in the summer
I might have to start watching the Chinese league now if they keep buying everybody
Isn t that 12 million MORE than they were asking for him
nah i believe it was 38 mil pounds
Got it thanks
no it s just that they would quote his value in pounds which was 38m which roughly equates to 50m euros
Got it thanks
Thought they wanted 60 from LFC
Spend 6 months in China get a premier league move in the summer perhaps
I hope these players realize that some of these top level Chinese clubs have a history of not paying player salaries on time and match fixing
Using some is a bit disingenuous isn t it Only club mentioned in both of those articles is Shanghai shenhua who had an apparently shady owner I m not saying all Chinese clubs are vanilla clean but don t paint with too broad a brush The Chinese govt is down with this its a bit different now
Geez
Bruh what
The fuck
Fucking crazy
China is basically Liverpool right
Yeah pretty much
For anyone wondering the team isn t called Jiangsu Seals as far as I can see it s Jiangu Suning
Jeez didn t even notice It was supposed to be Jiangsu Suning as you said I screwed up
holy smokes No wonder they didn t want to sell him to liverpool
How true is this Is this site reliable
It is done deal and you are searching for reliability
God dammit China you re not invited to play with us
How come he didnt join Chelsea
China want results and they want them now apparently
Great news for Asian football
It is such a strange feeling as both a Chinese and a Liverpool fan I don t know what to say
Good for him I don t think we should spend that much to get him I think we can get Chicharito or Lucas Moura instead
What the actual fuck
That s weird considering this pic from his snapchat today
Good news for Schalke
I for one welcome our new Chinese overlords
Wow Liverpool got snubbed big time
Liverpool decided he s not worth 50 million right now they weren t snubbed
We could of got him just apparently Klopp said no to that fee

neville should never have accepted to manage valencia in the first place
I have to agree When I heard the news I dismissed it as bullshit I cannot understand why this would even happen And here we are
At this point I also think he should resign It isn t working and he is disappointing everyone involved with the club It might not even be his fault but I think Gary needs to understand that perhaps he isn t the right man for the job and walk away from this so that Valencia can recover With him staying it seems unlikely he will turn things around his team will likely keep performing poorly while Gary will take shit from fans media etc Everyone suffers and no body wins
The effort from the Valencia players was just shocking It really seems to be a problem with a disconnect here It doesn t seem as if they want to play for him at all Watching Valencia under Neville reminds me a lot of Spurs under Ramos in his 2nd season
I agree with you it may not be his fault but he can t do anything to get Valencia back on track they need a different manager besides the language barrier has played a big part when Neville tries to give orders to the players
Did you not get the r soccer memo Taking this job was a win scenario no matter what You see if he fails he can still try out in England with a championship team A first job at this level in a foreign country doesn t count for some reason If he succeeds he is immediately a CL level manager No matter how much he loses he can t actually lose
except he s now on the verge of being a joke If he had aimed lower he could have started at a small EPL team Now the likes of west brom would not even go anywhere near him no offense to west brom
Nah
It doesnt count because even redditors with no experience running a fucking football club can see it isnt very fair to judge his overall management skills on the current situation Only his judgement on what teams he should be managing
He got thrown in the deep end and is sinking in a spectacular fashion It will count when it s time to apply for the next job
He ll have to take a big step down if he wants to continue in management but some are making out that his career is over A lot of teams in England will be willing to give him a shot
It s not over but he did shoot himself in the leg with this move
I hope it s over 90 of manager appointments in football seem to be celebrity or nepotism based and this one is both Gary Nevillle has done the square root of fuck all in management yet he gets one of the top 100 jobs in the field Ridiculous
More like top 30
I honestly didn t know how to approach ranking them so I went with something that I think by almost any priorities would still be true
either way why would you hope his career is over
As a manager Because he s gone about it completely wrong He s irresponsibly accepted a job that he 100 can t do from his rich friend massive red flag about his judgment right there He s never going to be on the dole and it is clear that he s not interested in building a career in management only being given one so no great loss Mostly it s so that he never gets appointed United manager Now if only we could somehow ship Giggs out too we could do away with the delusional fantasies about Ferguson rubbing off on them The only one I d welcome back at the club is Becks and that s because the only way he d come back is by getting rid of those cunts currently bleeding it dry and becoming the owner himself
This pretty much I don t know why Valencia thought that it would be a good idea to bring in a manager without any experience and expect him to get results I think Neville should come to an agreement with the club and part ways it would be better for both I m not saying he doesn t have the ability to manage a club but he should start with a smaller challenge
Its not what you know but who you know proves right again
There s owners that understand that just because they own a club doesn t mean they know how to run it Then there s Peter Lim who thinks he knows what he s doing just because he s a billionaire
It s not who you know it s who you blow
It s not who you blow it s how you blow
So you re saying even if I blow the janitor well enough I m going to get that promotion
Yes because the janitor is really the CEO of the organisation who is taking part in the Undercover Boss series Although you may have some explaining to do to the wife if the producers don t edit that segment out from the final broadcast
I mean fair play to the owner for giving him a chance but this isn t how it should have happened The main reasons being he has never managed a team before and he can t speak the language Gary will get another job the problem is he jumped in at the deep end he needs to go to a english club at a low division or championship level and work his way up
These four comment chain is in every thread with Valencia or G Nev
Repeated chains in multiple threads of people saying the same things Well I never
Doesn t he like own 10 of Salford City Couldn t that cunt just started his coaching career there
He probably sees himself as someone who is above managing at a non league team Tbh I don t blame him Why start at non league level when some clown at a big club is going to offer you a better job Neville probably knew he d end up getting a decently sized job one day
The two men in charge at Salford at the moment are working miracles
Exactly I think the only way to rectify the situation is to give Carragher a shot
Here here all in favor say aye
valenica is the worst club to start a managerial career too unstable and many problems on off the pitch
I don t think it s that at all Rather he doesn t have experience and he has no way of communicating directly with Any players
well true but valencia are a mess at the moment not a great place for any inexperienced manager
Why not A chance to coach a top level team and get invaluable experience why would you say no to that
yes i would say no valencia are a mess at the moment and there have been many problems
He would have taken the jump straight from no managerial experience to the top level if he had succeeded I m sure he was aware of the risks but still chose to jump into the deep end
The big issue for him is whether he can go back to punditry and be taken seriously again Before Valencia people saw him as an expert but now without some success he s going to have his 0 win rate and a 7 0 demolition at the hands of Barcelona in his shadow As a manager he can earn a reputation As a pundit his reputation will always have a red mark against it
neville should not return as a pundit no one is gonna take him seriously compared to before
When you consider he s publicly said since he was appointed that he doesn t consider his future to be in management I agree it s an odd decision Sky probably won t even have him back now after this track record
They hired Iain Dowie as a pundit
people in this thread are talking as if Neville is a mouthbreathing retard for not running out on the pitch and scoring 8 goals against Barcelona himself Listen dickheads managing a club is a process You can criticize a manager for a lack of success after spending tons of cash a la Louis van Gaal or Mourinho Otherwise there is very little a newcoming manager can do to magically alter the course of matches for a struggling team Without some time you could literally put a chimp in a suit on the sidelines and the results would be comparable to Alex fucking Ferguson s
Why did they even appoint and English manager in de the first place Not even the English do that
The owner of Valencia is good friends with Neville and co owns Salford City with him Not that that s a good reason to appoint him
To be fair owners do stupid things Mike Ashley widely regarded as a shrewd businessman allegedly hired Pardew because he was a gambling buddy of us
I don t get why everyone talks as of Pardew is some footballing Neanderthal who curses every club he touches and dooms them to relegation He won LMA and Premier League Manager of the Year with Newcastle It was hardly a stupid move to hire him Newcastle have only gone downhill since sacking him too
Newcastle have been downhill since the season he won manager of the year We over performed he got complacent and lazy
You placed 10th under him 2 seasons later hell of a lot better than how you currently stand
He d also done pretty well in all his other jobs Promoted with Reading from league 1 Took West Ham into the prem then to the FA Cup final which he only lost due to a masterclass from Gerrard and won the JPT with Southampton
I think honest in this context means that he should realize this himself e g being able to honestly assess the situation and draw the right conclusions from said analysis He surely wasn t meaning he was being dishonest or a liar
Yeah this was lost in translation just like Neville s tactical knowledge to his team
Neville is extremly limited tactically Just because he is good in explaining rudimentary things to sky viewers doesn t make him a tactical genius
How can you possibly know that Valencia were already in poor form though not as shit he doesn t speak the language and the players seem like they d rather stay at home rather than play football It s not going well but we have no idea of how he is tactically given the short time he s been there
German sport journalists and tacticians critizied him quite frequently for his analyzies because they are so rudimentary and miss the point of modern football almost always And seeing only old english football in his prime means he never really had to understand what needs to be played in spain today this is more of a refutal of a counterpoint than an argument people can be great tacticians without ever playing first division football but combined with his words and insights and the fact that valencia got worse and worse especially in a league that is tactically miles ahead than the one he comes from doesn t paint a flattering picture I mean I could be wrong and he could be a tactical genious but it s unlikely because nothing ever suggested he is If you listen to the way Tuchel or Guardiola or Tobias Escher or even Mourinho talk about the game this is not the way Neville talks He for example still doesn t understand modern day defending and that it s not just done in the back four Neville talks like he would fit in right with the ZDF sportstudio and that is not something that shows you can cut it as a coach Maybe in england where the german press writes that it seems not even J rgen Klopp can teach his not that complicated ideas to english footballers how will guardiola ever
I am doesn t mean it s not a whole culture that gets socialiced into those players
Does German media critique English punditry That seems absurd
A lot of english punditry is fucking gash though tbf Match of the day is the epitome of shit analysis
Yes people worth their salt look over the rim of the plate so to speak I hate german idioms
Keep in mind that the audience has a great influence on the MNF analysis They have to make it so that the audience can grasp the concepts which might make the analysis a bit more anglicised It s not a perfect picture of their pundit s philosophies although Gary s stance on defending is his own He has previously stated that he wants to play a high pressing game with a bit of possession mixed in with fast transitions Somewhat similar to Pochettino s Spurs Gary s Valencia already seem a lot more fluid in attack and their wing play can be quite lethal they re also scoring more goals The problem is that they haven t found the right balance and they re leaking at the back Although there are a lot of negative things that can be said about Valencia s game at the moment there are a few positive signs I just think it s way to early to judge Gary s tactical abilities when he s not even given the chance to manage a team in a stable situation for a longer time period
You are right about everything and I did phrase my original comment wrongly It s not that I know he is limited it s more that people here suggest he is a genious because they once understood that there is something like marking an opponent because they watched sky My original intent was merely suggesthing that he never really showed that he is on par with a good first league coach tactically especially a spanish one and that lots of people in the business think that he isn t because of the way he always speaks And it s not that he explains it rudimentary it s about how he thinks about the problems and solutions You can explain cutting edge tactics simply but that s not what he does But you re right I do have no way of knowing that he is tactically limited It s merely informed speculation and my comment didn t reflect that level of certainty For which I am sorry
Tactics mean naff all The players failed under Nuno as well it s clear as day that the playing staff simply aren t up to scratch
I agree with you except for your last comment It ain t for losing to Barcelona its for the terrible results he has achieved also the away cup tie at Barcelona is no excuse for losing 7 0 this is Valencia we are talking about he deserves all the criticism
Mourinho lost 5 0 with one of the most expensive sides of all time in his first season at Madrid Sometimes your game plan doesn t work and your players play badly and you get spanked
I agree with you but Mourinho didn t drag Real Madrid from the top 6 to the relegation zone at the time Valencia are on a terrible run with Neville breaking all sort of records if you then lose 7 0 you can t expect anything else Also Mourinho got a lot of criticism for it people are still trying to make excuses for Neville
Also Neville is taking a gamble right now he is not the most qualified person to manage a club this stature Clearly it wont pay off so it would be logical to call it off before it gets worse for him and the club I think Canizares made a valid point using the worst wording possible
How is he not qualified He is an Uefa licensed coach Not experienced yes
Pretty much what i meant to say
I believe people make excuses for him because he is English and liked by the majority Moyes performed about the same at Real Sociedad his first season and he got turned into a meme Everyone uses the excuse Well it was the best team Barcelona in the world or They were already performing horribly before he came in but honestly they finished 4th last season and now they are 12th If anyone says They lost their best players I ask Who Otamendi
Valencia were already going that way before Neville arrived tbf
No we weren t Look at the results
He did not go his first 8 games without a win though many of which Valencia were expected to win
I like getting spanked
Should ve watched some MNF clips
Ca izares is a colossal douchebag He s the closest Spain has come to producing a Guy Fieri except on top of it he s a prima donna Best thing he ever did was drop cologne on himself in the shower at WC2002 and let Casillas break in
the loss is surely expected but looking at the terribly negative performances and results in La Liga then you have to admit it it doesn t work like at all for Gary
I doubt that he gave the interview in English
losing and getting hammered 7 0 are different things He couldn t even manage to shut down the team when it was 3 0
Ca ete is a dickhead Always has been
Doesn t make him wrong Have you spoken to a single Valencia fan in recent weeks Practically all of them feel the same and want Neville to resign It s a completely understandable reaction from a Valencia fan which Canizares is
deleted
Sure beats the hell out of the nauseating phony politeness that is too often the norm among native English speakers
I m not sure if it s legit but I ve seen this quote being passed around https pbs twimg com media CaUt3lyWAAAqvfu jpg Maybe that s what he s talking about
not real apparently
Wouldn t be surprised But still if Canizares thought it s legit he might think of Neville as a dishonest person
That date was a Wednesday so doubt it
Barcelona won against PSG on that day 3 1
Damn If he was to go back to punditry stuff after this the viewers and his fellow colleagues will never let him live this down Anybody he criticizes will use his previous managerial situation as an armor
True but he can easily say I took a chance to manage a proper team it wasn t easy but a valuable experience nonetheless
I thought players managed by Alex Fergusson would turn into some fantastic managers like Brian Cough s did Sadly it hasn t really happened except maybe Steve Bruce So far people like Keane Solskjaer and Neville have been a tad disappointing Maybe in a few years we ll find out
Mark Hughes is the best of the bunch surely
If we re being extremely loose with our definition of former players Blanc would count as the best manager that played under Ferguson
You know I forgot about him You re right he s good
Hughes is decent If Ole can pull his head out of his arse and stop managing like he s playing FIFA he could make himself a decent career in one of the big leagues some day
He had a crack and he was shite
Laurent Blanc does quite well
Hughes as well id consider to be on the same level as martinez rodgers pulis moyes etc Upper midtable prem managers so pretty decent
Ack I completely forgot Hughes played under him
Keane was a Clough man too remember
I don t think it s fair to judge Neville that harshly yet He was thrown into a situation where he doesn t know the language and the low confidence the players had likely wasn t helped by the owner hiring his English only friend to try and turn things around Maybe it wasn t a great decision for him to accept the position but who would turn down managing Valencia We ll be better able to judge Neville s skills as a manager after he spends some time at an English club
You re right That s why I added maybe in a few years we ll find out at the end I m still open to Neville or anyone else to prove me wrong
Are you saying you weren t happy with Alex McLeish as Villa manager
I was always behind McLeish I think he was hired to be the fall guy and it wasn t fair on him It was the season where we had to sell all our high wage players due to our new financial policy i e Slowly destroy the team To do this the board knew they needed a manager that Villa fans already disliked didn t mind his credibility being destroyed and wouldn t mind him being fired after a season so they hired McLeish Birmingham City s manager
Gary Neville as a pundit is outstanding As a team manager not so much It pains me to say this but he should resign for the good of the club and to salvage his reputation It s the right thing to do
How was he with the English Squad as coach
Apparently highly rated but the only way to assess that is if you re involved in the England set up really
Different thing anyway isn t it Wouldn t have done much motivating or team selection
He was apparently a fairly good motivator for England The players seemed to like him a lot It s a whole another matter doing it in a foreign language though
Thanks Geoff
What didn t you like about his punditry
Taking this job was just mad from Neville why would you leave your comfortable job as a pundit one that you re very good at doing and make your first foray into management at such a high pressure job
That s the way Neville works If you watch interviews with him about his career he s always talking about taking on new challenges and improving himself He s not satisfied with staying where he is no matter where that is
But he spent his entire career at Manchester United He seemed pretty satisfied with staying there
You make it sound like it s comfortable playing for one of the best clubs in the world Chasing silverware with sky high fan expectations and nailing down your spot in the squad of a club like that is a massive challenge Especially for a player like Gary who s always been technically inferior to his peers It would have been much more comfortable for him to join a project team where no one really expects you to succeed
Not saying it wasn t a challenge playing at Utd just saying that it s not true to say that he s not satisfied with staying where he is no matter where that was because that was exactly what he did at united I m just being an annoying pedant adding nothing of value to the conversation
I think he said something along the lines of I dish it out on a weeky basis so it would be disingenuous of me to turn down the offer But as many here have pointed out it probably would have been sensible to start somewhere in the UK in the lower leagues For a number of reasons Doesn t have to adapt to culture can communicate with the players and staff less pressure probably more well known respected
It s OK Santiago Canizares is a reknown dufus I don t think they should sack Neville but maybe they should bring in an assistant coach who can support him better
NES is laughing
his Portuguese army did well better than this at least
Neville has nothing to apologize for he is clearly doing his best and that is all anyone can ask
He shouldn t have to shoulda never have been hired in the first and should be fired He is an absolute joke this season
Sky is the limit for Gary
Again it s not Gary s fault that Valencia is doing poorly Valencia never had major tactical problems with Nuno They had motivation issues and the fans didn t like Nuno it doesn t help he was an untested Portuguese coach They needed a coach that 1 Speaks the local language to be able to lift the players spirits up 2 Is respected by the fans to avoid conflicts with them and the press like it happened with Nuno and then lead to players demotivation and Gary can t do any of these things This is just the wrong job for him
You re right mate Thanks for the correction
I m guessing you haven t watched us this season Valencia did have tactical problems with Nuno Our attack was incredibly unimaginative it was failed cross after cross I can t complain too much about his defense but we were still getting dominated by nely promoted teams and bailed out by Jaume being the best keeper in La Liga during that stretch he had top 5 stats in Europe in save pct and some other areas before the turn of the year Neville came in and basically traded that defense for offense so now we let up goals but look more fluid offensively Neither of them have found a balance I don t think a lot of Valencia fans really hate him either as he doesn t directly antagonise them like Nuno there is more anger towards Lim and the players We just know he isn t good enough Before week 15 when Nuno was sacked GF 19 padded by a fluke 5 1 win against Celta GA 12 2nd in La Liga to Atleti Current aka with Neville GF 26 GA 23
Lol how is it not Nevilles fault that they re playing like shit In December Valencia drew 1 1 with Barca Last season it took a 93 Busquets goal for Barca to win
Seriously Barca Valencia has always been a tough game Can t remember a game this easy in the last 5 seasons Last season Barca won 2 0 but Valencia dominated around 60 minutes of the game Barca scored in the 1st and last minute of the game I remember watching that game in shock and awe It was a bit like the Celta game this year but without an end product This is all down on Neville The key is pressing even Nuno s side did that
I will probably get downvoted to hell due to my flair but I do not understand why everyone is so determined to blame everything on Gary and only Gary I know he is not ready for the job yet and he obviously needs to go soon but I find it astounding that no one is even trying to say anything about the players The players do not seems to even care about the game They were jogging around nonchalantly and doesn t seems to be bothered at all when they are quite a few goals down If anyone disgraced the club it s the players for their complete lack of effort I understand that they might not like their manager but my god that was fucking awful from them I don t think Gary is good enough to manage a top club at the moment or any moment actually but to blame this humiliation completely on him is very unfair And this fiasco Valencia find themselves in They blame the owner they blame Gary but no one even bothered to talk about the players I personally thinks that the players have to share a big portion of the blame too
well unfortunately for Gary this is down to him as well players sense that the manager is incompetent and will be replaced soon so they do not care as much anymore even if this is done subconciously Add the fact that he can t even give them a proper head washing due to his lack of language skills and you get what you see now
A lack of motivation is also in large part down to the coach It s the coach s responsibility to motivate and bring the best out of his players If Simeone Conte or Guardiola had been managing the team you can be sure the players would be giving 100 Neville does not inspire respect fear or love from his players That is crystal clear and a failure on his part
A bit harsh but his record is crap He s not ready
If he comes back and does it as well as he did back when he managed them and pulls off two league trophies again I ll name my firstborn Rafa even if it s a girl
ITT british MNF fan trying hard to defend Gary People just admit it it doesn t work He doesn t win games he doesn t win the dressing room he doesn t win the fan appeal he doesn t even win the fundamental basic communication
1 British guy defending him and 1 Portuguese guy Don t make up shit to support your narrative
But how else will he hold a view which is obviously true to everyone while still convincing himself he s smarter than everyone else
In Messi s 3rd goal the side back was marking a player on the left wing who he should have left alone Looks like the players are still learning defensive shifting
Neville got off to a slow start as a pundit on Sky Sports too but quickly turned it around to become one of the best I think the major problem here is the fact he can t speak Spanish
does it not seem like a bit of witch hunt over there against Gary at the moment i mean i know he has done a terrible job so far but it seems like the Spanish media and ex players are tearing him apart more so than they would have if another manager was in his position
Well Imagine Arsenal or Tottenham hiring a German TV pundit because he s friends with the owner and that manager then does an outstandingly horrible job of it while they slowly drifts towards the relegation spots Imagine the witch hunt then
I don t think that the fact that he is english has nothing to do with that He hasn t won a single match of the last 11 plus most Valencia fans and media are always delusional and they really think that they are the third club in spain close to Real and Barsa That s why they are tearing him apart
The nationality is relevant to some extent because he doesn t speak the language which makes a job he is already out of his depth in even harder
They did finish 4th last season so it s not a stretch to assume that they have a good squad In general CL qualification was the aim Also considering the amounts they spent they should be in the European spots Instead they re dropping points against the likes of Rayo Vallecano and Sporting Gijon Valencia fans might be delusional but most of them would be happy with 4th place
How are they delusional Valencia is a top club and have finished around 4th consistently and even won the league twice in the 2000s Imagine if Arsenal was sat at 12th in February The fans would be outraged and rightfully so
It s not the fact that he s English it s that he can t speak a single word of Spanish
He has been results wise our worst manager in decades He s breaking negative records that have stood for 20 30 years When he took over we were 4 points off 4th place We re now 13 points off and 5 points from relegation I think the thing is some people think he s just struggling like other managers have struggled here and don t actually know the extent of his failure so far
It works both ways you see a lot of English fans overly defend Gary Neville and thinking he doesn t deserve any criticism
Maybe I ve haven t listened read everything but I would say that the Spanish media has been holding their tongue until today and it s more the English one that has been harping on Gary Neville s Valencia still hasn t won in the league every day leading up to a game
If managers resigned every time Barcalona won a match like that there d be no managers left in Spanish football
How many managers lose 7 0 while in the middle of an 8 game winless streak in the league
I can name at least three off the top of my head from the past decade
Neville should have started with a different team
Have to say Canizares and anyone else who thinks Neville should do this are fools Granted Neville s start in Valencia hasn t been perfect he just lost 7 0 against a decent team containing what will probably be the top 3 players of 2016 He should be praised that it was only 7 0 Edit I didn t really mean he should be praised because it was only 7 0 come on people But this is crazy to call for his head after this one game that was against arguably the best team in the world containing 3 of the top 5 players in the world Based on his current run as manager maybe but that wasn t what Canizares was referencing
Hasn t been perfect is a fuckin understatement no victory at all and 5 points to relegation zone is terribly abysmal Anyone who sane enough to defend him is probably Sevilla fans
I guess we re talking about the league since Valencia has won 4 Copa games with Neville
How is it going wrong though Neville seems to have a great footballing mind Is it the players The language or style barrier Or is Neville just inexperienced I mean 0 wins in 8 is terrible but there must be a reason Valencia are underperforming Any La Liga fans care to share
He s inexperienced working in a country where he doesn t understand the language or culture in a team with high expectations in a tough league He should resign and try take up a job back in England at a smaller club The job was just too big for him and he is putting Valencia fans through he ll by continuing to manage
It is far easier to comment on grandmaster s games rather than playing with them
I don t get the downvotes to this It s a legit question asking why Valencia are doing so poorly at the moment
I was joking about the praised part but I still don t think people need to call for his head
Because he s been our worst manager results wise in decades Because we haven t won a league match since October Because we re quickly drifting towards the relegation spots A week before he took over we drew Barcelona 1 1 under our interim manager We ve now suffered our worst defeat in over 20 years days after losing to a promoted team at home Why would anyone in their right mind not want him gone
Idk fans are well withing their rights to ask for his head shown no improvement since taking over Allegedly has lost the dressing room Tbh his position is much similar to Jose during his end days but Jose had the fans on his side Neville doesnt
Cause Valencia haven t been shit against way lesser teams you say
I never said anything about that I m talking about this one result which is also what Canizares is talking about All I said is that Neville s term as manager hasn t been great
You were saying as if the criticism towards Neville was just because of the game from yesterday when Neville in fact has been nothing but a disaster for Valencia
No I wasn t I was referencing that this was a knee jerk response from a former player based on the result against one team If he focused more on the entire duration of Neville s managerial spell at Valencia I would agree
You shouldn t be losing 7 0 at any level of football ffs You do know how shocking you have to be to ship 7 goals
Mate don t be a Chelsea fan and go against common r soccer opinion at the same time It s not good
Fuck off with this persecution complex
Haha 90 of people here hate Chelsea fans for absolutely no reason
People hate Chelsea but that doesn t mean OP got downvoted for it He s talking straight shit Earlier in the season they drew Barca 1 1 and now they re losing 7 0 You people do realize that Valencia is one of the biggest clubs in Spain right They re not Rayo or Granada
Yeah I know he was chatting shit obviously losing 7 0 to anyone if you re Valencia is not ok
Had that reaction coming didn t I Should have known better

http www sport english com en noticias liga bbva filipe luis punishment reduced after messi horror tackle 4872863 They just published that
Atleti was so smart They used this when they appeal They forced RFEF to be consistent and exposed them so badly http www marca com en football barcelona 2016 02 03 56b25c63e2704eac178b467c html Incompetent bunches
So the RFEF saves face rather than admit they fucked up Well ain t that great
I don t know how long we carry on with this current RFEF and their system but I am really sick of it and it is so disgraceful how they are work and structured from top to bottom A player who bad mouthed the ref gets 3 5 match bans a player who endangers a players career gets one match ban a player who kicks elbows and lashed out his opponents almost every single day is currently at large with out any kind of repercussions because they are not in the ref report so FED UP with this sh t The only one thing that I always wish and hope to have in Liga from BPL is their structure system for disciplinary actions I envy it so much For pet s sake RFEF president is an outspoken die hard RM fan How is this normal to speak it out loud in public
That is very clever
This is so dumb Suarez gets 2 games for telling Espanyol players they are a wast of space and that tackle that could ended Messi carrear if his feet was planted only gets one
When Mascherano was the one who actually said that
Did you even see the tackle Filipe went in soft with very little force at the most he would have cut messi s knee with his studs
Words seem to be punished more harshly than potential career ending challenges
football becoming more and more pussified
If Messi s foot was planted that definitely could ve been career ending
To be fair if you start talking about if then it could ve scenarios people will sit out half the season
Hector moreno broke luke shaw s leg playing vs manchester united with a sliding tackle imagine the damage this couldve done if messi had his weight planted on that leg Edit victim name
Moreno s was a clean tackle But thats not the point Im putting into perspective how bad Filipe s tackle really was since you dont believe it was
What the hell is wrong with La Liga They seem to have to most backward rules
And they keep Orellana s 2 match ban for saying Qu malo eres arbitro you are very bad ref What a joke
The world has gotten to the point where words hurt more than actual things that hurt
Sticks and stones will break my bones But words will always hurt me La Liga
Words actually hurt too and depending of the words it hurts more than actual things But that s definitely not the case here
I don t feel like having this conversation but words physically can t hurt at all
People don t get hurt only physically
Well hurt has two definitions then I m talking about being physically hurt in pain words can t physically hurt people or cause them pain They can offend people but that s a completely different topic if I called someone a bad name they wouldn t go to the ground holding their leg in pain maybe they would start crying or something that s the point I m making words can t cause pain but people are acting like it can recently
I agree but you said it like words can t hurt at all when sometimes they can be more harmful than physical pain
what I meant is that they can t cause pain my bad
Questioning a referee s ability to do his job in the public eye could lead to him getting sacked Would you rather have a sore knee for 10 minutes or find yourself unemployed
Respectfully that s bullshit He deserves to sit out 3 for that heinous tackle on Messi
Key word is messi If it was someone else this subreddit would be okay with the decision Luis went for the ball and missed he didn t have any intention to foul messi He got the red card What do people want more Sometimes r soccer is so barca biased it s incredible
I m not a Barca fan that was just a really poor tackle He may have went for the ball but he missed BADLY Deserved red card suspension
is this a joke
There are 2 kinds of studs up One is a straight leg tackle that can end players careers and the other is a bent knee limp dick tackle that will end with a player getting a cut from the studs at worst Both are still against the rules and a red but one of them is much worse than the other This was the latter
WTF man Suarez gets 2 match and Pique gets 4 match bans and this gets one RFEF really needs to get their shit together or else at the end this will just look like a campaign against Barca
So a potential career ending tackle only gets you a 1 match ban Okay
Good to see a fair end to the career ending touch on Messi saga
I didnt think they even appealed
http www skysports com football news 11838 10154431 filipe luis handed three game ban for foul on lionel messi Atletico sporting director Jose Luis Caminero believes the challenge only justified a one game ban and has announced the club s intention to appeal Similar incidents ought to be judged in the same manner and have the same punishment he said
Why
I don t understand why everyone is freaking out about this It wasn t career ending and he probably didn t intend to do it he was looking at the ball the whole time yet everyone calls him a cunt
Good decision common sense won
Lol those guys are a waste of space
Good to see all these plastic Bar a fans so angry haha

180m mate that s so many prostitutes so many orgies
Please inform me how Neymars dad got such a reputation
Former santos director said part of Neymar s sale involved orgies for his father who owned 40 of Neymar when he was sold
When asked about the scene where David Cameron Throatfucked a dead pig the author said that she only let that part stay because that made her smile Same thing here but in the news And people will remember it just for the sher amusement of a guy buying hookers with his son s money
But to be fair the idea of D Camz putting his cock in a dead pig s mouth does make one smile
Seems like a total fucking twat tbh
basically Neymar Senior charged Santos for Bitches and Orgies as business fees
Some Newspaper published it people wanted to believe it because it s funny and people believed it
He probably read that in Marca
This fucking guy
this guy fuckin
This guy fucks
I ve been known to fuck myself
I dabble
r selffuck NSFL If you re thinking that can t be what it sounds like you re wrong
I don t think Neymar will move because he has it all what a player wants in Barcelona Maybe in few years forward we will see
But he ll always be in Messi s shadow At any other club he ll definitely the focus of the team
Neymar is the successor to Messi simple as that
It s not like Messi s 37 year old or something now
In 5 years Messi will be 34 and still really good but do you think Barca s talisman is gonna be 34 yo Messi or 28 Neymar
You think he s going to want to wait 5 years
I don t think he d mind waiting while playing with him
I don t think he would want to wait that long
Currently play with the best attacking trio on the planet including world 1 Messi Looking forward become the world s 1 whilst playing alongside Suarez and slowly replacing Messi I mean shit I m 90 sure he won t leave unless there are personal reasons not related to money
This I m sure he ll stay as long as the trophies keep flowing
Messi and Suarez are the same age
I think
As i see him i think that at some point he will want all the spotlight for himself
It s either 5 years in his shadow at a club not winning as many titles without learning from the GOAT or 5 years in his shadow at a club winning titles and learning from the man himself
Messi will drop back to midfield and Neymar will start scoring all the goals
And then Messi will drop back to keeper and Neuer will shit his pants
I m not so sure that Messi will just leave quietly the spotlight
People really starting to take this for granted eh I d be very surprised if messi is still starting past 33
Why There are plenty of good players at 33 and older who are still starting for their clubs Messi might lose his speed but he won t lose his vision and passing ability so if he starts playing more of a playmaker role what would stop him from excel even at 33 or older Xavi did it as well and I would argue Messi is even better than him
Im tired of this argument Messi isn t even that good at passing
You can t be serious Messi is one of the best passers in the world for sure Just a quick search brings up plenty of examples and highlight reels https www youtube com watch v 49WSqKuk hI https streamable com vocx https gfycat com UnkemptWelltodoCicada https gfycat com OrderlyUntriedAfricanporcupine

He s not Xavi but passes pretty well specially switching the play
Exactly being able to do some assists doesn t have anything to do with being a playmaker Well something yeah but there s a lot more to it
No but he s almost 30
Is it old for a football player now being 28
This quote is fake the actually quote is here Neymar s father has said in court appearance today that a club offered to pay 190M buyout fee but that player only wants to renew Either way the court issues he has in Spain are so tiny compared to the issues he now faces in Brazil no matter where he goes the court issues will follow him and his assets in Brazil will remain frozen until its fixed They have some 500pages of allegations against Neymar and his dad there ffs
His assets in Brazil is that a lot I mean sure he s probably not going hungry just curious
What Marca didnt mention is Neymar Sr saying they had deal on table but he wants to stay at Barca probably for judge to know there will be plenty tax money incooming
Daaaad Shut up you re embarrassing me in front of my friends Turns to Suarez and Messi I m so sorry about him
Neymar s father will bring him down
Doubt greedy motherfuckers like him are people who end up in the top Dude was earning half a million from his son when he was still 15
Why would he say that to the judge Is he a Barca fan
lets hope so
please be PSG please be PSG please be PSG
It would be so crazy if we did sign him I know we have the money and we need a LW but unfortunately seems unrealistic
So Neymar on the left An Argentinian on the right and a Uruguayan down the middle
its a good combo i hear
you guys don t really need him you are doing JUST fine in the league
It would be a great move from PSG I can imagine Neymar Ibrahimovic and Di Maria playing alongside They would tear the Ligue 1 and the Champions League as well
Probably us Woodward likes to make ridiculous bids in the 0 0001 chance they pull off I don t mind that as long as we actually get someone in when we need someone unlike last summer where we failed to get a right winger
yes probably you guys looks at perez
Numerous sources in Spain are reporting it was indeed United
Yup I m seeing the same thing Also seeing quite a few rumors about Mourihno being close to a deal with United
It s probably Madrid actually Perez knows Ronaldo is closer to the end than most would like to admit He s got he money and this is exactly the deal he would like to do Huge controversy massive marketing opportunity
Well I was going off the fact that Neymar confirmed that we did bid for him last summer so it s fairly likely we d make that an open bid of sorts
Yeah and Woodward would be foolish not to try for that percentage Neymar is the next Ronaldo popularity wise He ll probably sell more mercy than anyone in the history of our club
As I said I don t mind him doing that
190m is a ridiculous offer that Barca might actually accept But Neymar is not worth that much money
I hope we don t accept it It is a lot of money yes but we cannot get a replacement as good as he is Especially for our team and the synergy Plus he is only 23 24 tomorrow He will only improve
I believe it s his release clause The much larger barrier is Neymar himself why would he leave Barca now
exactly barca can offer him anything manutd could so there s no reason for him to leave
By all accounts their wage budget has been far exceeded and they may need to offload someone I doubt Neymar would leave Barca for us but we can offer him more money
United can offer him the chance to prove it on a cold rainy Wednesday night at Stoke
Mate even Stoke can offer him to play with Messi 2 0 and some other Barcelona legends
Implying that Stoke aren t building a Champions League squad are you
I would say the offer probably comes from another spanish club
why would you be worried about barcelona accepting a bid then
Because it is a release clause no accepting necessary
I get that but he still stated his worries a couple of posts above that he hopes barca won t accept the offer in the context of his posts i m still wondering why he d think that barcelona would accept an offer from real madrid I suppose if it s another spanish club bidding the money e I guess I should change a word in the post you re responding to
Barcelona will never accept the offer unless they are forced to do it
If Martial at age 19 with not even 50 senior games and practically no National Team call ups and barely any global marketing exposure is worth 80 Million over staggered payments Then Neymar in 2016 going into 2017 is most definitely worth 180 assuming same currency units Footballing fanbase is many years behind the curve in Real Footballing Pricing its been the case for decades its only in hindsight they accept prices have inflated beyond their mentally accepted range
Who could they get for 190m that would be as good as Neymar and as young as he is The guy is already one of the top 3 5 players in the world and is only 23 Barcelona don t need the money but they do need him There s no financial incentive to sell him at all
That s 140m I dunno I think in 2 years time he ll be the undisputed best player in the world so seems worth it to me
Idk the way Pogba plays I m not too sure that Neymar will be the undisputed best player But I also love Pogba so maybe I m biased
Neymar is much better than any young player in the world atm including Pogba
Pogba is also younger and we re talking in two years time if Pogba will develop the way he does and transfer to a club that pushes for the CL trophy in a regular basis he surely will be the best midfielder at 24 years of age The way he s been playing this season for Juve is seriously out of this world so much better than any young player might be a bit of a stretch Mind you the Barca squad as a whole is a lot better than the Juve squad yet Pogba still plays ridiculous football for a team that just won 15 straight games
He has a 140m release clause It s not up to barca to decide
That only applies to Spanish clubs how many times does this sub have to be told time and again that Spanish clause is a Spanish Only instrument Non Spanish clubs can not use it They have to use other mechanisms which increase the price beyond the Clause figure making it a redundant exercise
How did Bayern buy Martinez even tho Bilbao didn t want to sell Or herrera to united
I do not understand what stops a foreign team from partnering with a domestic proxy Say Rayo want to buy Herrera from United and United want to buy Neymar and most unlikely here Neymar wants to go to United What stops United from part exchanging Herrerra cash for Neymar where Rayo trigger the release clause and then pass the player on
IIRC the player has to pay their own release clause to their club then the buying club can reimburse them
Not to their club but deposit the money with the League FA Buying club can give the money to the player sure but then that would get taxed as Income jacking up the price and subsequently the transfer for the buying club Buying club can t do it on behalf like Bayern did which is why that deal is shady fraudulent and never been replicated United tried but didn t come off the first time then they went the normal route though its also somewhat shady
Then Why bid 190m
140m 180
Ah right Wasn t thinking clearly
Lol no Barca is not accepting that Thats why they are renegotiating new deal with higher release clause
You have it the other way around Neymar probably is worth that much considering both talent skill and marketing value But Barcelona would never accept that deal
I would like to see him play outside of Barcelona would be interesting
Yeah as much as Barca fans love these loyal world class players they ve had in Messi Iniesta etc it s a bit boring for the rest of us
TBH I think Neymar might eventually move in his career I have the feeling his attachment to barca is more related to his idolizing of messi than anything like barca worship I don t think his attachment is the same as someone born and raised in la Massia
deleted
deleted
Just because it s the most popular doesn t mean it s the best quality
deleted
It s not unlikely that it will be one day once the English teams sort their shit out There s too much money in the league for it to not have a strong chance of becoming the strongest league in the world
If everyone in China tunes into their league they ll be the most popular league Doesn t make it the best
It s worth noting that until about 2009 English teams were amongst the strongest in Europe
Neymar is a grown man why does he have his father manage his career
Because players don t have time to be a manager agent and a player And some hire family to take care of that kind of stuff
Family managing stuff is very common for South Americans
The father is his manager agent Messi s father is also Messi s manager agent
What kind of player manages his own career you fucking idiot
You think it s either his dad as his agent or nobody Speaking of fucking idiots
I d say Zlatan but even he s got an agent Not just anyone at that
By we does he mean Barcelona or Neymar himself I believe his dad managed to capture most of his transfer value the first time around Could he do the same this time too If he doesn t renew till 2017 he could potentially ask Barcelona for some of that 180m or rather force a deal where Barca has to accept a figure near 100m and the rest is pocketed as agent fees If he doesn t renew till 2018 and runs down the contract completely he could pocket even more as agent sign on fees
Barcelona owns Neymar 100 This is not like the Santos situation Although considering how dodgy he is I can perfectly see him getting some money as a transfer reward
Barca only has Neymar on contract till 2018 even with 100 ownership After that hes free to sign with whoever he wants So Barca will likely have to compensate Neymar for the fact that he could be making 100m in agent and sign on from his next employer should he not choose to renew
Good thing the quote on this post is fake and the actual quote is that he received an offer but he wants to renew Marca is just twisting a few words up not like they would ever do that right Not like Marca would even Photoshop a stadium to look more like Madrid to
More to look like Madrid to What
Probably a Chinese side
Madrid ManU or us I won t mind having him in the team Please come
Interesting
Neymar father looking for his own interest instead of his son s
ITT fans of other big clubs taking this seriously for some reason
His father is a cancer to him
I bet 180m he s going to City
agreed he s already mentioned he d like to play for Guardiola
Lol that s probably us Even if it s rejected I hope it turns out it is us so there s actually evidence that the club has ambition
At a club in a country that doesn t care if their footballers pay taxes

On November 25th 14 weeks 3 months before the last 16 ties UEFA gave Kiev a well deserved stadium ban for racism Not only have they overturned the ban reducing it to 1 game but they waited 11 weeks to do so So instead of 3 1 2 months to book holiday time off work and save up money to go the the away day City fans now have just under 3 weeks This is despite both clubs urging UEFA to look at the appeal immediately to avoid this kind of situation The clubs have tried to make some sort of gesture by reducing tickets to only 4 50 but the ticket s were only ever going to be a tiny fraction of the cost the packages City fans are scrambling to put together are 450 for travel And getting time off work is going to be the biggest problem for a lot of blues Hopefully they ll still see up to about 1000 of the 2200 allocation taken up but expect this to be added to the ever growing list of reasons City fans will boo UEFA
The chaaammpions BOOOO
And people wonder why we boo their conceited anthem Collection of absolute cunts
City should just buy some 1000 2000 fans tickets travel lodging food booze r soccer would go bonkers
I am a bit confused What does the fact that they don t have a ban or a shorter ban change to the location or date of the game I don t get what the upsetting factor is Genuinely interested
For the last 4 months City fans were told the game would be played in front of an empty stadium and on Tuesday UEFA decided to lift the ban and let Kiev have a full crowd
Ooh that sucks Thanks for explaining I read it wrong
4 months The draw was made mid december city couldn t have known who they playing before that let alone what ground it s in I agree this is too short notice but they haven t had 4 5 months to book holidays off and save money for
So where was the game going to be played before the stadium ban got lifted Im confused to as to why this would affect time to book holiday save up money and get time off work if the game was always going to be played there just with no home fans
So city fans wouldnt have been going anyway
I don t know how you are struggling with this UEFA has fucked over City fans by leaving it until the last minute making it almost impossible for most of the few thousand who would have gone and supported the team in Kiev to make the game
You didn t take up your allocation vs Sunderland Dunno why you re annoyed
If the biggest club in the world can t sell out when they force season ticket holders to buy tickets what hope do little City have http www dailymail co uk sport football article 3431614 Manchester United close entire section Sir Alex Ferguson stand low ticket sales Europa League tie Midtjylland html
How are away sections primarily consisting of hardcore fans not selling out comparable to home games full of day trippers You can t sell out your away allocations Why is that
Have you got a spreadsheet of City s away attendances Why do you care so much swear United fans get more joy from counting seats at City than they do following their own team
No mate I literally looked at that photo that was posted on the Internet Did you not go Saul Did you go the the semifinal vs Everton
You looked at a photo with the bottom half cut off and assumed it wasn t sold out clever one you aren t you No I didn t go but I did go to the semi final with Everton Are you flirting with me Gonna ask what my favourite colour is next
Why isn t the top stand full It s full when I go
Who knows why are you so interested
Just stating facts mate Good excuse this oh it s last minute this Kiev game Can t go
Haven t United announced just yesterday they aren t opening the entire north stand because no one is buying tickets for your Europa league game Not the best time to be picking fights over attendances
It may have escaped your attention but there are games for 4 cups City fans have to choose from Sunderland on a Tuesday night Maybe not top of the list
Sunderland is a great trip What about the semi final vs Everton
On a Tueday night Don t be fucking daft
Last time we went mid week to Sunderland we took our full allocation
Good for you After all that s what football s about isn t it who s got the biggest fanbase If only I d known as a kid
It s about having a mint time with your mates
What about it City got the biggest crowd of all the semi finals Liverpool and Everton didn t sell out either
So now we can expect to see the stadium completely full of Kiev fans and only about 1000 City fans
probably a greater than 50 50 chance they do something racist before the game and get the ban put back
City have that many fans
Why would a PSV fan attempt such awful Banter Edit oh you re a plastic United fan Of course
deleted
What
Did you go Sunderland away Not many did
Wow Someone s a little obsessed
The away section was sold out
It clearly isn t
Hahahahahaha that all you have to knock us on nowadays Pathetic Sign of the times I suppose You know Old Trafford had circa 35k empty seats when you played a home cup tie to Ipswich earlier this season don t you United didn t even publish the attendence figure such was the embarrassment We average 98 9 full to capacity at home in the league for what it s worth Keep desperately trying to claw for that attendence jibe anyway I m sure it ll sooth you to sleep at night when you reflect upon your regression into an also ran desperately scrapping for the top four each season while you bang on about istree and class a la Liverpool as Manchester s own reign uncontested and hoover up all the pots with Pep at the helm for the foreseeable future Enjoy playing in our shadow kiddo if you haven t got used to it already that is
Fuck me Can see you re still city Bitter as fuck Clearly hit a nerve there Do you have any proof of the Ipswich game I sit in J edit Found it 56607 Still more than you can get You re pathetic You don t even go to away games do you Which is what I m talking about
Hahahahahahahahahaha Calling me bitter as you trawl City threads making jibes about the occasional game where we didn t take full capacity Joker You lot are the new bitters That s what I call you and it s accurate The role reversals are well and truly complete You are obsessed As a quick aside I do go to away games I didn t go to Sunderland but I went to Villa and I get to more away games than I don t Which is useful because I get to see City rise to dominance while you lot sink into obscurity and palpable bitterness Lovely stuff You get to any games or are you another armchair red from the home counties Either way enjoy watching us well and truly piss on your chips from a lofty vantage point for years to come I look forward to your regression into claims at istree and class over the coming years growing more and more pained as each trophyless failed season passes
Keep it to one reply mate You ll pull the end off it How are GMP counting them people By hand Use your brain mate All we ve got You re not exactly pulling up trees You re fucking dogshit aswell I m from New Moston and leave in town by the way I also go more games than you
Hilarious Especially considering our average attendance is literally 20 000 more than yours
When did City start to get this reputation of having an empty ground I remember them having a large and dedicated support when they were in the second and third division about 15 years ago
I mean it s called home field advantage for a reason It s an advantage for the home team
The point is that if there was no ban in the first place there would be more City fans there Except there was a ban cos their fans were done for racism now it s lifted so City fans have a very limited time to get everything sorted whereas for Kiev fans they can easily just get tickets now and fill the stadium So City fans who wanted to go over and watch that leg are being punished for UEFA taking so long to announce the ban is lifted
Yes That sucks But its a home stadium If there are only 1000 city fans then you should be happy that 1000 city fans were allowed to buy tickets This is not a rare occurrence
You don t seem to understand the situation
The situation is very clear My point is that you guys are complaining about something that affects very few people and is really not a big issue A few hundred people won t get to go to the game
If you don t care that s fine But don t try to convince everyone else of why you don t care or that they shouldn t care either Why are you deciding what passes the threshold of what does and doesn t matter to r soccer And this isn t just about a few hundred people it s about Manchester City and UEFA mishandling something again and specifically something related to City again You don t have to be one of the few that have been gypped out of going to the game to think it s bullshit
Right but UEFA has handed them a bigger advantage than they would otherwise have despite the fact that they were done for Racism
A closed door game being made open 3 weeks before isn t a rare occurrence My point is if they announced that the ban was lifted when the draw was made the amount of City fans going would probably triple at least
If thats the case maybe city should just scrap the away end and only let home supporters watch
That just makes zero sense We re talking about Champions league not Premier League Obviously Premier League clubs are going to have substantially more away fans as the time to travel is minuscule compared to this
But you said we should be happy to have been offered tickets at all you said nothing about potential numbers of fans offered tickets are you suggesting just because its in Ukraine that they shouldn t offer tickets to City fans
That s not at all what I said 1 000 fans is standard This is a non issue Anyone that wants to go can still go You might see a loss of a few hundred fans due to work issues but the tickets will be there and the travel arrangements are there Should this have been solved a while back Obviously But there is way too much drama about such a small issue The city fans will be placed in the top corner of the stadium and a thousand less isn t going to change anything
Im not quite sure what the point your trying to make is now
that s nice
Look at the bright side of it You can use that as an excuse if you lose
UEFA are a joke The ban should have stuck it s a punishment at least stick with it But giving fans that little time to book off work and sort out travel is a joke
Time to work on my booing vocals
The did the same when we traveled to Hungary during the EURO 2016 Qualification The Faroese team rents a plane and sells all the spare tickets to fans to finance the trip but when since there was a stadium ban they had to travel with no fans for the game Only when the team arrived in Hungary were they told that the stadium ban was lifted giving fans no chance of getting there
they lifted it because playing in an empty stadium would ve been like a home advantage for City
Eh not the worst banter I ve seen on this sub don t know why you were downvoted
Because its literally the same shit joke posted on every thread It s gets old pretty quickly like the chat shit get banged nonsense on every Leicester thread
talk irrelevant material get assaulted
relay false information get hospitalised
Because when we have a higher percentage of the stadium filled than Liverpool it gets old
Oh it s completely bullshit but it s still half clever
UEFA does nothing against racism in Russia Shocking
Kiev isn t in Russia yet at least
Kiev will never be a part of Russia again
deleted
The minute Russia sets foot in Kiev is the minute that the missiles are in the air That shit won t fly
hahah yet 1
Close enough
But did you go to Sunderland away 1
There was always going to be one away game why are they only just now booking time off work if they must go to the game
Because it was originally supposed to be behind closed doors

as messi as you can get
I need some Neville gifs from this match
It s like the ball is made of iron and his foot is a magnet
OP Pls nerf Arsenal
i thought that was pretty neat
500th goal
And as usual he reaches a landmark with another hat trick justMessithings
i think the word is milestone hehe
Statistic of the day A goal landmark is more likely reached in a given day by scoring more goals
i love how suarez always gets so happy when others score lol
He s a great player for the team
Yeah he was trying so hard to get Neymar his goal Can someone get a gif of that dribble
Definitely
The commentator at 3 05
Haha Almost sounds like he swallowed a bug
just like CP7 does arbeloa and bale
RIP in pieces Gary Neville s managerial career
I think that I m glad this has occurred It will humble some of his analysis Don t get me wrong he does a great job but he can also be very cut throat So being on the managerial side of things he can have a more level analysis since it isn t as easy as simply saying don t do things that way
Fair point
Whenever I watched him it felt like he brought up points that were obvious but that you didn t know were there unless he said it and then you couldn t unsee it Have you ever experienced that when someone points out something you didn t notice before but once its been pointed out you can t unsee it That was his bread and butter and he made sure to feed the viewers plenty of that
If it can be called managerial
If it can be called a career
What career
Dirty pass from Suarez
Messi tells turan to pass to suarez
Messi even points for the pass to go to Suarez first and starts his run as Suarez receives it
Suarez looks like he s packing up to go live on planet Alien with Messi and Neymar this season Unfuckingbelievable All three of them are untouchable right now
Not a hater but saying Suarez is going to join Messi and Neymar is just wrong Suarez has been the best player in football for the last 3 4 months
calm down
That s a pretty calm reaction for what s happening
Wow that was really brutal
How the hell does he keep the ball
It still surprises me even though I know already
My word Barca could have 5 or 6 by now
How about 7
could ve had 10 tbh 1 from penalty 1 from Messi s post and 1 from Neymar s 5 chances
that penalty why didnt he do it normally
Run ups don t make a difference Balotelli practically has no run up and is the best PK taker in the world Messi has normal run ups every time and still misses occasionally Neymar is just bad at taking penalties in general
How he kept the ball from the Suarez pass that s pure Messi
Which pass The assist
Both
The ball is glued to his fucking feet
Do they actually practice those back heels and stuff or its just magic
I love how he points before he scores as if he has already processed what he is going to do all within a second
It s really cool when you can see it so clearly but it s hardly unusual to be one pass ahead in your movement at this level
Like a chess player Messi can anticipate the next move so well
He probably called for a flick on Its different processing when you cant hear the other person call out what they re thinking
I don t even know what to say anymore
What an assist from Suarez Perfection from Barcelona
The understanding between MSN is just unreal he points at Suarez knowing exactly what he s gonna do
I love how Messi points at Suarez before the chance is created Messi wanted that to happen before Suarez even had the ball Incredible team play
Barcelona are an amazing team but in this match I can t help but notice how terrible Valencia s defending is
for this goal at least i thought they didn t do a whole lot wrong except you know actually win the ball Other times you see defenders not go with runners etc but here they were marking pretty tight Only obvious thing here is that Turan wasn t put under pressure at all but can you blame the defenders when they have to watch the front three
Beautiful stuff amazing how he keeps the ball and doesnt go down
How on earth can you stop that Messi at his very best
They could try to mark him instead of floating like 10 away from him when he is on the edge of the box
And they say Tiki Fucking Taka is boring
He s golden
He is stardust
MESSI MESSI MESSI once in a lifetime
Barca were playing how many backheels can we do today Like they re not even trying
This was such a Messi goal
That Suarez flick made it
Typical Messi
Seriously how are they so good
The understanding between MSN is just unreal he points at Suarez before the chance is created
most messi goal of the three His 500th
I love how Messi points at Suarez knowing exactly what he s gonna do
And he created that chance for himself by telling Arda to pass it to Suarez
That is just so ridiculously good it s stupid
Messi s balance and dribbling is godly The ball just sticks to his foot
U see Suarez after the goal I honestly think he is having the most fun on that team Every video I see him in regardless of his input on the play he looks so happy Hopefully it means less cannibalism
GOAT
His 500th career goal Very Messi esque if I might say so
I hate to bring Ronaldo into every Messi thread but that there is why Ronaldo will never ever be considered even half as a good a player as Messi no matter how many goals he stat pads off Granada and FC village boys
i agree so hard
I don t how that statement is even relevant Valencia are worse than those teams you mentioned at the moment So goals against valencia are considered worth less than the ones against Espanol Go get a clue
Look as a Madrid fan I hate to admit it but r walkers crisp is right While Cris is scoring meaningless goals against noname teams messi and barcelona are scoring meaningful goals against important decent teams Valencia isn t worse than Espanyiol Granada or FC village boys which I guess he means Rayo Vallecano or one of the other teams Madrid have scored 5 this season A quick look at the table gives us Valencia position 12 Goals against 23 goals in favour 26 for a 3 difference Now Lets see the other teams Granada position 19 Goals against 44 goals in favour 24 for a 20 goal difference Bottom of table relegation zone team Rayo Vallecano position 22 Goals against 47 goals in favour 28 for a goal difference of 19 Bottom of table relegation team Sporting Gijon position 17 Goals against 35 goals favour 23 goal difference 12 Another bottom of the table team That only shows in stats how Valencia are NOT worse than those teams you mentioned this is obvious not only because of this stats but if you actually watch la liga you would know that statement is just false As a madrid fan I hate tot admit it but Cris and madrid are not remotely comparable to messi and barcelona right now while our goals are against m lmo espyniol and other noname teams barcelona is already in a cup inal scoring against decent teams And do not forget that we tied 2 2 against valencia It is the sad reality this season
Like I said his statement comparing Ronaldo and Messi is not even relevant As a madrid fan I hate tot admit it but Cris and madrid are not remotely comparable to messi and barcelona right now Not remotely comparable Ronaldo is the top goal scorer in the league and the Champions league despite playing in a below par madrid side which isn t clicking in midfield defence No one is doubting that Barca are playing as a unit and much better efficient football That doesn t mean it can be said that Ronaldo isn t even half as good as Messi which is a ridiculous statement While Cris is scoring meaningless goals against noname teams If it was easy every decent footballer would be doing it are we going to pretend Messi doesn t do the same You are going by table position which is ridiculous Valencia have been going in only one direction in the league for a long time now they were beaten by sporting gijon only 2 games ago yet you want to say Valencia are the better team Espanol and Granada are only 3 and 5 points behind respectively Everyone knows Valencia are in complete disarray under Neville The fact Madrid drew with them many games ago means nothing Barca have drawn with teams Madrid have smashed this season doesn t mean anything That only shows in stats how Valencia are NOT worse than those teams you mentioned so your fact evidence is crock of s t Ronaldo is 31 and just scored a world class dazzling goal in his last game Lets see If messi will have that kind of longevity when he s 30
deleted
Omg good straw man as if I was basing his longevity on that one goal I already mentioned he s top goal scorer in two competitions this season He s below par but he s still got it Messi isn t shining the WHOLE Barca midfield and strikeforce are shining ronaldo shines when people make him to Implying Messi doesn t get support from his team to succeed Please don t go full retard Football is a team sport
Go post that shit to Goal com
Why u do dis RIP NEVILLE
It s like when you are losing by a large margin on PES Fifa so you just start hitting the slide button desperately
Incredible balance and ball control
Beautiful stuff amazing how he keeps the ball is made of iron and his foot is a magnet
Suarez knows everything he s the Anti Jon Snow
This is the definition of a pass to the net instead of a shot
I think we are on our best form of the season
D10S
Suarez looks like he s packing up to go to Suarez first and starts his run as Suarez receives it
Messi points to the first pass he can see the triangle before anyone else lool
hes just out there playing chess
People cussing Neville But if you watch closely you will see that Valencia are defending in an orderly manner They have their 2 clear lines of 4 They haven t left any obvious gaps The problem is no one is actually defending No one is tackling It s almost as if they believe that Barcelona will lose the ball automatically You can t dispossess Barcelona unless you put in a tackle
I was watching the defenders and not one of them wanted to get in there and make a killer tackle They all just politely go through the motions without actually trying to stop Barca scoring It s bizarre
I hope Ney gets a goal too
Gotta feel for Neville man Totally out of his element here
Fuck off he knew what he was getting into
To be fair if you were offered Tottenham job English equivalent of Valenica IMO would you take it Of course you would It must be the employer who is held resposible
lol messi I got u homie
I don t know much about this sport but I see this Messi bloke pop up a fair bit He must be pretty good I like the way he dribbles the ball really close

I think QPR made far worse decisions over a far longer period I don t really mind our signings if they were summer signings I doubt anyone would complain It s hardly like we re following the QPR model of repeatedly getting expensive mercenaries without any solid foundations We bought two hungry young England internationals
Here s some of QPRs alleged wages Joey Barton 70 000pw Chris Samba 100 000pw Julio Cesar 75 000pw Park Ji Sung 70 000pw Sean Wright Philips 60 000pw I can t be bothered writing the rest out But just be reassured it doesn t get any better
That s legitimately incredible
In any case you are still one of the highest earning teams in england and qpr is not so handling a higher wage bill in the championship would be much easier
Well I hope you stay up The Premier League doesn t feel the same without Newcastle Plus I m excited to finally see Saivet in PL
QPR signed known mercenaries on high paying contracts it s hardly the same as two English internationals in their early twenties with a lot to prove
Nah QPR were spending something like 200 of their turnover on wages I m guessing Newcastle is nowhere near that I think I know it was definitely more than 100 but the point still stands
This sounds familiar Weren t they in a similar position last time they got relegated Although to be fair with the squad they ve got and the financial advantage they d have they re all but guaranteed to come straight back up if they were to go down which I don t think will happen
Isn t that what everyone said when you lot got relegated to league one Doesn t always work out nicely for the big clubs in lower leagues you get stuck there for one season and it can easily turn in to five
Considering the parachute payments for being relegated are 150 million this makes sense If Newcastle do go down they want to keep the core of the team they have now to come back up again
As much as I like Newcastle if they stay up we don t And that hurts
So you reckon the appointment of Guidolin will see Swansea to safety
I think Swansea will be absolutely fine A decent team in a lull that they should be coming out of soon
I ve only seen like two Swansea matches this season but they usually play attractive football too Bit strange to see them so low on the table so I d agree with ya
we do look a lot more settled and happier than the teams around us People forget that we are easily the least financially capable team in the league we live within our modest means because we are a fan run club and that is pretty fucking admirable in my opinion Much nicer than having Ed Balls as Chairman or a Russian billionaire like the much much over rated Bournemouth
Wow i didnt know it was possible to be fan owned in english top flight
always rated you good luck staying up you can do it
Have you seen Bournemouth s end of season run They are far from safe at this point as good as they look
Townsend was as bad as expected in his first game and Shelvey had quite possibly the worst game from a player I ve seen in awhile Hope they improve or we re fucked
Welcome to the Jonjo His performances veer from top four quality to absolute drivel sometimes within the same match
Yoyo Shelvey
I guess we watched different games because Townsend was one of our better players against Everton made forward runs tracked back A bit rusty but not bad at all If we are going to slate anyone why don t we talk about how mitro ayoze Gini Sissoko were all AWOL And this article doesn t mention one glaring obvious problem We invested in attacking players we are paper shit thin in defense Colo isn t up to snuff our left back position is dire dummet is absolute shite But yet we don t sign any defenders Now Mbemba may be injured and we are fucked What I would do to have Santon and mbiwa back now
Where was Townsend playing On the left
Yep Sissoko on the right
It didn t help that Barkley was having a fantastic match as well
Meh He was OK Lost the ball quite a bit by trying to do it himself Did not like his performance too much Lennon was the obvious MOTM playing really good
Even if they improve you really should have spent your money on defenders
Yeah we should have we ve been wanting and needing new defenders for 3 4 years
The strange thing is that of all the players Newcastle has purchased recently Mitrovic Shelvey Townsend Lascelles Perez and even Thauvin all were really highly rated prospects So they re either all washouts or they need a new coach who can actually develop their talent I m betting it s the manager rather than 6 or 7 players all being terrible
By all accounts McClaren is an excellent coach but a manager with tactical nous and the confidence to react to games and act under pressure Looks like not so much
Yeah that s what puzzles me I always thought that McClaren could do the job of coaching and maybe the players have improved and just aren t playing in the right positions Either way it s time for a change
Enjoy the next half dozen matches of team destabilising shit from Jonjo until he has another blinder Good player for the derby though maybe
Gosh I sure hope it pays off
This is the kind of sarcasm we all love on r soccer
Shit knowing r soccer it s probably genuine
They ll just do what they did last time they got relegated Keep a more or less premier league team even if it is a relegated premier league side and tear the Championship a new one all season then come back with the fans in a good mood about everything
I d take it if we could be sure keep our core and get a new manager and owner in the process
It s not a huge deal They can just pull a qpr and loan then to other teams in the top flights Yeah not ideal but by loaning them out you get the first team spots to play the next crop of toon youngsters in the ship Then the first teamers that got signed continue to play and so do the youngens All you need to do is get promoted next season and bam they are new signings again no money needed Granted it s not ideal obviously to get relegated but every storm cloud has a silver lining
We have no good youth
Where s Nobby Solano when you need him
Where is John Carver when you need him Honestly I m sure John could have won some of these games that Steve is dropping
Yaaaay
Shut up baby we know it
Silly Newcastle Why gamble when you could just fold like we did
Prob should have signed some defenders need to beat West Brom or we are screwed Didn t really expect us to beat Everton away anyway
They should have signed Lord Bendtner to save them
Fucking embarrassing
They aren t getting relegated
Oh no Billionaire Mike Ashley spends 28 million but technically has made a profit on the club over last 4 years I m sure he won t go hungry haha Ridiculous article
Can t hurt to read the article

What the hell is going on We seem to start bidding at 40m for 18 year olds when thats the going transfer fee for close to world class mature players
That s how the clubs around Europe seem to react to the new PL TV deal basically saying share the wealth pal
Yeah you saw it all over Europe The moment an EPL team came knocking on the door the transfer fee went up quite a lot It s also a form of protecting your own interests We ve sold Wijnaldum and Depay to United Newcastle Manchester and thus have had to get replacements ourselves Because we made a decent enough deal clubs were raising their asking prices towards us as well So you can t get away with not asking ridiculously high transfer fees these days because you ll be unable to get decent replacements into the squad edit for clarity
It s tricle down economics
And it works great just look at how many different clubs are dominating the Champions League
Four
Exactly I posted below that Sanches is obviously not worth this much but it s a reaction to how much money the BPL clubs now have Same reason that Porto managed to stretch Stoke s offer on Imbula to 24M even after his awful 6 months Even a crappy no disrespect intended BPL club has double or three times more money than Porto
You re right the expression just eluded me at the time Mid bottom is a correct statement
I m a Nazi and Jews are the scum of the earth no offense though
I want to suck your dick No homo
Not really Look at us Arsenal we got 3 world class players for good value Ozil Sanchez and Cech was a steal and recently signed El Nenny for 7 million which itself is a bargain given his talent and increase in our fanbase at Egypt We have to blame the PL scouting and negotiators of the clubs Because it is upto the scouting network to figure out multiple targets and the negotiators to negotiate a deal
Market research says that Egyptians are good at online polls I guess
You got Ozil and Sanchez 2 and 3 years ago and you got them for bargain prices 45m each actually because you got them from Real Madrid and Barcelona who were trying to make space and raise some cash for Isco Bale and Suarez respectively I agree with the PL scouting and negotiators part though
This is what happens when you double the amount of money PL teams have available It doesn t make any new players Also United pretty much have to seize the Martials of this world ready made players are all going to 3 4 clubs
No this is what happens when you consistently overpay
How consistent of us to overpay on 2 transfers from the 10 12 we ve made in 2 years
I m referring to the EPL
Overpaying is a byproduct of clubs knowing that English clubs have more money to throw There s a price for regular clubs and then there s a price for richer clubs If we were selling Imbula to a French club for example we wouldn t ask for that high a fee
Downvoted for telling a truth Football is a big business but I really believe that no player should be earning 30 million a year what if they earn max 10 million which is enough I believe and the rest of the money goes to other useful stuff It s a shame that there are people diying in other parts of the world because they don t have food and we are here allowing companies who make that money thanks to us to give it to only someone who can play good Football
That escalated quickly
I just thought about how much they earn of course they should earn millions since they are seen by the whole world and have only until their 34 36th to play as professionals usually But there really should be limits
why It s just how the market works if less people are interested in football the players will earn less but since it s the most popular sport in the world the salaries will keep on growing
I know it but I still think that someone should put limits there
But then the money would go to the owners of the clubs rather than the players who actually play the game This is just capitalism mate
Maybe someone should put a limit on your job and see how you like it
I don t even earn more than 1000 bucks and am still a happy man From that I still pay to a ONG humanityfirst
It isn t true Prices for goods that cannot just be manufactured always boil down to a ratio between supply of good and supply of money from the buyer So a sudden increase in money will just cause an increase in price If you could just manufacture a Neymar you d get clubs doing that to undercut the demanded price but you cannot do this
No offense but coming from a bar a fan You have a ridiculous wage bill lol
Yeah we have but it s not me who decides to pay so much And Barca has to pay much if they don t want to loose their players to teams like PSG that s why I m saying there should be a limit of how much money should be moved in just a sport
Di Maria never settled in Manchester and spent most of the season playing like shit for us You can t predict that sort of thing Also ADM was our record transfer so he was far more than 30 40 million
Way to miss the point which is that United didn t have CL but still attracted Di Maria and Falcao How both of them fared after that isn t the topic here
Hilarious that you re getting downvoted for speaking sense
We can t always rely on world class players being forced out of their clubs and having no other choice than to join us as was in Di Maria s case
It seems to be a case of Woodward being in Mendes pocket He must surely be stringing them along in promise of genuine superstars
Unlikely we ve shipped out a lot of the Mendes clients lately
This Mendes has so many clubs in his pocket Real Madrid Monaco Valencia Man U Benfica who make usually profit thanks to him though
Don t forget Monaco
Well in Martial s case it looks like it will prove to be a great transfer
well we dont know that yet he s still only 6months into his man utd career
Martial s a good player but he hasn t been worth anything like 38 million yet let alone 58 or whatever his fee rises to Six months ago he was little more than a talented youth player now he s a talented youth player with half a seasons experience People are talking abut him like he s already one of Europe s elite forwards but he has a long way to go before that s true He s got plenty of time to get there but it s far from a guarantee at this point
That is because the tag is far too often used
Exactly looking at Martial s attributes and performances it seems he deserves that tag more than 90 of the players who receive it
Don t think anyone would pay that much for him if we put him up for sale but he s certainly playing like he s worth that much to us His value atm in our lineup is certainly that high
I m sorry but he s just not He s doing really well for a 20 year old in his situation but the fact that a 20 year old is in that position in the first place is ridiculous
We got Nacho for 200k FFS
I think it will likely become a much better deal for us but they ve both got a long way to go before we know for sure
Might be the next Macheda for all we know Granted he looks a lot more talented but good starts aren t always a guarantee
Next Macheda Macheda had one goal and one other decent game How could you possibly compare him to Macheda He didn t just start he s been showing his brilliance all season
that list of names u could have said is a hell of a lot bigger then the list that goes on to make it world class or even a top player
Yeah they definitely hit the jackpot with Martial but to make 40mil deals now for every unproven player is really stupid They should definitely be being world class proven players
Have you seen this kid Renato playing We ve already missed on a lot of good players let others go Hazard Thiago Pogba and co If our scouts and staff think he is worth it be it
He s not worth 60 million I reckon you d be able to get much better players for that price
Like Jonas
That s debatable it s still probably the same kind of bonuses Martial s contract has and we will be happy for paying the total sum
He s really just not that impressive as a player though He s very skilled but doesn t quite strike me as reliable yet anyway especially against actual good teams 50 of the portuguese league are basically filler teams For that kind of money or less you could be able to get Bernardo Silva liver Torres Moutinho maybe even Hamsik if you re looking for an attacking option Hell maybe go for Bojan if he keeps playing well in the PL For more balanced or defense minded midfielders you could try Sa l iguez Andr Gomes Kramer Geis etc There s plenty of proven quality players around who might go for that kind of money Renato Sanches would just be a silly gamble You ll still be able to buy him for 60 million if he becomes a world beater in the next two or three years anyway
Balance and Defense minded midfielders and you list Andre Gomes That sums up the knowledge you lack and how people should disregard your comment here
I think he s balanced Fair enough he goes forward a lot but with some conditioning he could be a really good box to box IMO But sure disregard what I said Renato is better than all of the above big s
Gomes can defend he used to play at defensive midfielder for us
He has more potential than Gomes who is like 4 years older and makes a lot of the same mistakes They are a lot similar in their playing styles btw being midfielders who carie the ball more than they pass it Bernardo Oliver are totally different players so not worth to compare Moutinho will never be good enough for United a not so good Ander Herrera But your final point is very true but as we learn time and time again United is not well run at the moment so we should try to take advantage lol
It s hard to tell potential he s got the skill but could end up another Hugo Viana who was good tbf but never lived up to the hype Bernardo and liver are more 10 s than proper central midfielders yeah but you d think a midfield with one of them Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlein could be pretty good Then again it s United I disagree with you on Moutinho though I think his work rate and vision would improve most teams But I guess the same could be said about Herrera and United are still not doing great
There are other top teams around who would try to buy him thougt it s a gamble but it can pay off
But why gamble when you can get someone who is undoubtedly a top player
The point is not his potential who is unquestionable He is nowhere near enough that kind of money right now As for midfielders attacking players he is our week link at the moment just to give an example He would probably be a word class midfielder in 4 or 5 years but he is not now and will not be in the near future so that kind of money is not smart for a team who wants to win the PL For that kind of money you should try to get a word class mid not a project of one
Lol it s been 6months and they paid 80m Euros for him
Their scouts spoke highly of him there were many other clubs after him he s been very good for them ever since and they could afford the transfer without breaking a sweat so what s the problem
It does Solid player but he hasn t played any better for United than he did for Monaco especially when you consider he s arguably been outplayed by a number of players in his age group
Mate What games are you watching Honestly
The ones he s played for Monaco United I know my post will be down voted and buried because you can t disagree with EPL supporters on this sub but Martial only has 9 goals and 4 assist through 28 appearances for United He finished last season at Monaco with 9 goals and 4 assist through 19 appearances Beyond the numbers his style of play appears roughly the same Great at beating his man especially coming down the left mature beyond his years solid passer good acceleration etc Good player no doubt but has he outplayed Coman Gabigol Leroy Sane Thomas Lemar etc Not really He certainly hasn t done anything to warrant a fee within range of Neymar Suarez
It s all relative to the team they play in Coman is surrounded by world class talent and gets consistent game time The other players are all focal points for their squads Martial is playing in a team that s been going through a series rough patch How can you say he s not been as good as he was a Monaco You can t even compare the clubs The pressure on the kid is immense He s been the teams best player by far and is the reason they re heads still above water Seems you re just playing devils advocate
Coman Yes but maybe not like 30 million more Sane is an Academy product hard to talk about when this is all about money
I disagree but that s a fair opinion Anyway Coman cost Bayern 27m so it s 60m more
Honestly this sub is turning more and more into a circlejerk for PL watchers etc The support for Neville is simply mind blowing
9 goals 4 assists from the left wing not as a striker mate
He played on left the wing at Monaco as well
Stats aren t everything in football though It s his style of play and the way he powers through defences The guy has tons of potential and he s already playing really damn well
He certainly does have potential and usually when a club buys a young player they re primarily paying for that potential but with Martial that isn t the case to the same extent because that deal included 20m in clauses to address that potential on top of the 38m they paid just for the player as he is Honestly there s no question whether he s been worth that so far United paid 38 million quid for him out of the box and have relied on him as one of their primary goal scorers this year and their return has been six goals and four assists in 19 league games That s perfectly reasonable from a young player in his first PL season but considering he s arguably United s main goal threat not to mention what they paid for him it s just not good enough Stats certainly aren t the only thing that matter and you can tell watching Martial just how much potential he has but a club like United needs its forwards to create goals and Martial isn t creating enough at the moment
The point is he s playing the same for United as he did for Monaco He hasn t shown any progress that indicates he ll be anything more than a good player which doesn t cut it at 80m
80m for an 19y o can t be called a great transfer no matter what and we ve given 50 of resale profit to Monaco Delle Alli is what i d call a great transfer edit I was incorrect on the 50 part It seems the deal isn t as bad then
That 50 resale clause only comes into effect if we sell him off in the next two seasons for between 60m 90m so that s not likely to occur
I stand corrected on that point
No problem I remember his full transfer info was posted on r reddevils It was pretty in depth
Where did the next two seasons clause come from
It s actually before 2018 I should have clarified that
Do you have a link
Yup here is the link to the agreement itself It s a PDF and here is the link to the thread on r reddevils where people were discussing it s credibility
It s reflective of the state of the market There is a dearth of talent available for purchase Football clubs especially those in the Premier League have more money than ever and have no need to cash in on their assets Prime example is Saido Berahino at WBA they are hardly using him but even then they won t take 20M for him United tried to sign big name players all last summer from the big clubs as I m sure did other clubs try the same with no luck It s logical to then move onto the younger players the price you pay for them is what the market demands Martial IS a great transfer for what he offers the team you can t argue that Without his presence in our side we d probably be midtable and I d say 80M is worth that
Martial is indeed worth 80m to us but thats because we ve dug a hole for ourselves where there is not much quality in the squad And thats because we ve been overpaying for players for a while now so that our transfer budget hasn t bought a whole lot of quality So its a self perpetuating problem
Which players do you feel we have overpaid for
We overpaid for Fellaini Mata and Herrera quite clearly when you consider that they cost nearly as much or more than Rakitic Griezmann Fabregas Sanches Ozil Douglas Costa etc
Mata is the odd one out here he was playing like a world class player at Chelsea and moved in January That s easily a 35 million fee these days
Mata can play world class but only when the system fits him He is not versatile and has a lot of very serious limitations pace dribbling speed strength defensive work which is why i think he was a bad choice to be paying 45m euros for compared to Alexis Douglas Costa Griezmann etc who went for similar amounts in the last 2 3 years Fellaini and Herrera were similarly putting up great numbers in their teams where the system suited them but have underwhelmed because they are players with serious limitations At the end of the day before Di Maria and Martial we had fallen way behind in terms of attacking quality so now our pursuit of targets with attacking quality is borderline desparate
Rhubarb
Wrong guy
Honestly the going rate is whatever the selling club wants it to be And in this situation it wasn t enough
In about three years is going to be one of the best players box to box in the world He have a clause about 80m Now is the only kid i remember maybe Ronaldo in Sporting with is age 18y o that win incontestable first team and is playing like a god Samaris Talisca Fejsa have lost their place But if you want the player you need to pay more https www youtube com watch v uTqYlAFLtaw This a video some MU fans made Now in CL agains Zenit you can see what he can do
and 60m would be a good price for him when he develops into the top 2 3 world class mids Not now when hes yet to develop into it and there is so much uncertainty
Yes But Portuguese clubs right now with the new TV deals are in good financial conditions And we dont need to sell If you want him you need to pay And now you english clubs have a strong competition with China They offered 90m for a Hulk with 29 years old
Playing like a god Lmao cmon do you even watch your own games
Yes he s playing very good yes It s him that made Benfica and the team score a lot of goals Jonas and Mitroglou are showing because him In the first games with Samaris and Talisca we lost a lot points and we had a less 7 points to Sporting right now we have less 2 points With him in the first team we have 10 strike wins he never lose the ball like Samaris he s strong and steal more balls than Fejsa or Samaris And i prefer Benfica stay with him some more years but to sell him they need to pay a lot He s going to be a great player Is enough we sell our kids for cheap Bernardo Silva for 15 M Andr Almeida for 10 M Cancelo and others for cheap price
your winning that games in a row thanks to an in form Pizzi and Jonas The kid is good i give you that he can carry the ball and he is really strong but he misses a lot of passes and the only reason he got first team football in the first place is because you had no decent alternative in the benfica squad
He s not worth 60M obviously but sometimes a club can only sell a player for way more than what he s worth he has no alternative like you said he s a fan favourite we apparently don t need money so I like that we are asking for a price this high I was sick of selling at least a starter every freaking January
jesus christ you re completely deluded
I think Sanches is good and has tons of potencial but you can t expect someone who has only been a senior player for 6 months to be worth 30M bonuses it s ludicrous There s been plenty of cases of peak form wonders or one season wonders I know we as in Benfica and Porto overprice our players and everyone knows the BPL clubs are stacked but really 30M 20M in bonuses and Benfica wanted more money for a 6 month pro player Let s be real now At the moment I wouldn t pay more than 10 15M for the guy it s just too soon Remember Bebe
I agree that paying more than that is a bit of a gamble but you can t argue that Benfica did wrong for asking more His sell clause was set at 80 million not because Benfica is a club that slaps clauses on players without any regards to their value or potential chapa 5 or should i say chapa 60 deeming those clauses irrelevant in discussing offers but because Benfica differentiates their players and values them accordingly Sanches is probably the player with the most potential in the club and a clause that high is a sign for other clubs that they can t just come in and snatch them Benfica had to give up a few already for a value that was lower than their potential not because they didn t reach that potential but because they didn t have room in the squad s plans This changed and Sanches one of the signs of it but if not for demanding more both the buyer and the player would be given the wrong idea If Benfica told United yeah we can t ask more than that but we just don t want to sell him that would set that value as precedent It s soon but if he s just starting his evolution is just in the beginning and if he doesn t falter his value will rise If all the way to 80 million i m not sure but that s the potential Benfica thinks he has so clubs aren t to be made expect that the sell clause is irrelevant as long as Benfica still is confident in the player
Hey Benfica can ask 800M for all I care I m just saying there s no way he s worth what Benfica are asking at the moment for 40 60M you ll get a still relatively young but much more experienced player who is probably really good Heck didn t Bayern buy Vidal for 40M just 8 months ago In other words Benfica can ask what they want but if United pay more than 10 15M for him at this stage they are insane Then again since Ferguson left they ve spent a ludicrous amount of money and gotten nowhere so yeah they are insane
deleted
I understand your point but that doesn t address what i am saying My point is that i can understand a 40m bid on Mahrez for example Hes not world class but hes proven to be a top 5 prem player for atleast most of a season But we re just asking for it and can t possibly get any good deals ever when selling clubs know that our bid will always escalate beyond 40m even if the target is an 18 y o
Money talks Money shouts Don t take much to hear
ITT people who either have never seen Sanchez play or delusional Benfica fans A 60M valuation is completely ridiculous Not even Hulk left for that price and he was the most talented player to grace our league since Deco proving it over several seasons both domestically and in European competitions If you guys think a player on his first professional season with just a dozen games under his belt against mid table Portuguese teams is suddenly worth a 60M transfer you need a reality check Or maybe just a slap in the face
It s not 60m It s 40m bonuses The bonuses basically mean that they only get that money if he becomes a great player The same thing happened with Martial
Doesn t matter you can scrap the bonuses if you want 40M is still too much Heck talking about millions in the magnitude of double digits is still too much He literally played around 14 or 15 top division games the majority of them were against bottom half and mid table teams in a league which is not exactly the epitome of competitiveness aside from the top 4 I think he played once in the CL against Astana which again was one of the weaker teams in the competition and as a sub in their loss against At Madrid iirc Point is he has proved nothing aside from a bunch of fancy tricks against shit tier defenders He needs at least a full season showing consistency and high form before even getting CLOSE to that valuation And even then Just a quick reminder that Talisca was also the second coming of Jesus after scoring a bunch of goals in the first half of the season after signing for Benfica everyone and their mothers were already offering God knows how many millions yada yada yada Nowadays he s more of a burden than an asset when he plays and Benfica would gladly offload him for a little over their total investment on him Like I said consistency over time is the key A good stretch of games means jack shit
Debatable
Smash
what about Di Maria
Not even close He only played at a consistently high level on his last season here he was stagnated for quite a while before that Hulk or Falcao s numbers aren t even comparable to Di Maria s during their whole time in Portugal like water to wine Talking strictly about their performance in Portugal both of them were superior to Di Maria
But Alexis Sanchez plays for Arsenal
This is why the Martial deal even if comes good was a bad deal for United now everyone will try to hijack United going forward It s all well and good to say no problem we Man Utd can afford it but it s not just the tens of millions you overpaid for this guy it s the potentially hundreds of millions you ll keep overpaying into the near and middle future
Everyone seems to be keep on saying that when no world class experienced players seem to be leaving Real Madrid Barcelona or Bayern which is what we need Have to find solutions to that right
It s pretty much the same situation City was in when our project first started
They don t really have to be from top 3 Look how Douglas Costa turned out to be amazing for Bayern You guys need better scouting and a competent board with a clear vision
You would be correct if United didn t have the money to consistently overpay but fortunately we do
Perhaps But tens of millions here tens of millions there it adds up to real money soon enough Let s not confuse MUFC has more with MUFC has unlimited
I think this is more of an ad for Renato
spot on none of the man u fans get it even after theyre constantly used for new contracts and advertising players
Nah mate Gaitan and Garay will transfer to United any minute now
Not before we tie up Wesley Sneijder lol
Surely Ronaldo will be their number one target
We all know
comments in the thread suggest otherwise
No wonder we re signing Qatar deals
If you don t want to pay the toll walk away from the troll
more propaganda
yes O Jogo is Benfica s newspaper now don t you know it
yes the kid is definitely worth 60m
Copying my previous comment He s not worth 60M obviously but sometimes a club can only sell a player for way more than what he s worth he has no alternative like you said he s a fan favourite we apparently don t need money so I like that we are asking for a price this high I was sick of selling at least a starter every freaking January
I think he was doing sarcasm
I know that
don t believe it if benfica had received a 40M 20M offer vieira benfica s president would have accepted it and would be hailed as a negotiation god rightly so The kid may be the next portuguese ballon dor or not but the fact is he s barely played half a season in portuguese football for god s sake
If we had of bought him we probably would have loaned him back for the remainder of the season so if we really want him we will go back for him in the Summer Still a lot of money for a kid though would he really be worth it in the future
Sorry for offending you so much with my poor grammar
Like me my english is worst than yours But for my excuse i had allways a pregnant english teachers in Highschool If i have 2 completly years is a luck insted the 7 years of english In Portugal they dont arranged substitute teachers in my time they only find a substitute teacher for History Math Phisics Chemistry or Portuguese but not to Physical education Geography Filosophy or english and French
when was that because i think that was more your school s problem than Portugal s
15 years ago And the HighSchool was a Girls highschool https www google pt maps search googlemaps 38 7266212 9 1565599 3a 75y 239 17h 92 37t data 3m7 1e1 3m5 1sRbZu3dTWkgFrqCIXQBnolg 2e0 6s 2F 2Fgeo1 ggpht com 2Fcbk 3Fpanoid 3DRbZu3dTWkgFrqCIXQBnolg 26output 3Dthumbnail 26cb client 3Dmaps sv tactile gps 26thumb 3D2 26w 3D203 26h 3D100 26yaw 3D153 34067 26pitch 3D0 7i13312 8i6656
Was it that shade of unappetising pink then too
I think it has something to do with the way schools were made in Portugal during the dictatorship They were usually grey ish but since that is a girls only highschool they probably made it pink
Nah I m just shit at typing English is my first language but I often type something how I would say it so I make a lot of mistakes
What else should he of said
What makes him such a standout player for his age Have you got a link to any recent articles or anything that I could read up on him
Not sure about articles or anything i d have to find some But from watching him play what i can say is that he s physically impressive both strong and fast He can pick up the ball and run with both pace control and skill and most players that stand against him aren t even any match strength wise to deal with him Due to his age sometimes he shows signs of overdoing it other times he gets cocky with passing lines and loses the ball but that s stuff he can improve with more experience He also has a powerful long range kick that he can use if given the space
Do you think he is ready for the step up to a club like United or would he be best served staying at Benfica to develop for another 2 or 3 seasons
A lot of things can go wrong if he takes a step longer than his leg and going from a club where he just became indisputable to one where he isn t sure what his status would be could either make him explode or shrivel if he s relegated to a backseat He didn t even start this season in the main Benfica team but he conquered his spot it would be way too much to take another huge step so soon I don t know how it ll be until the season is over or if Benfica can hold him during the summer but i think his potential is immense and i think he d fulfill it best by staying a couple more seasons yes As long as Benfica trusts in his growth it should pass the message to other clubs that his 80 million clause is the starting point of a negotiation
It will be interesting to see what happens in the summer so thanks for answering my questions
Can confirm FIFA 16 has taught me this kid is a beast
Watch sometimes Benfica and what Ive seen of him he is good enough to play for United
Benfica and Porto are incredible at signing good players and selling them on years later for incredible profit Makes you wonder what Daniel Levy could do in Portugal
https www youtube com watch v iVftPRbeixE
Benfica missed there chance here I think
This is obviously to much for him right now but we don t need to sell him and United have more money than they can spend so it s only natural to try to get as much as we can t As for Renato he has a lot of potential but he is a little raw at the moment as you would expect for a 18 year old making his debut in the first In terms of potential he as it all to be a world class midfielder and one who was made to play in the PL He needs to improve is decision making and defensive position going forward he is a beast in particular making those runs with the ball that Yaya used to make when he had legs he s almost unstoppable with a head of steam
Feels like football manager
Fucking hell The bonus strategy is a pretty good one by United though but clearly Benfica wasnt having it FWIW there s no guarantee they actually made that specific offer but I highly doubt Mendes completely fabricated interest from such a big club and Sanches was rumoured there for the entire window
Jorge Mendes is only trying to promote his player I don t believe in that scumbag s word he just wants to get Renato on the radar
http www transfermarkt com renato sanches profil spieler 258027 He s valued here at 800k I know it s not 100 accurate but 75 this valuation seems a bit over kill
If Renato Sanches is worth this I wonder how much valuable Jo o M rio is
Probably a measly 15 million
That s what you get when you pay a fortune for Martial Well done Vieira
New Gaitan
Go fuck off louis van galho The kid is at the right club he won t be leaving we need him to build a better future

On this seasons form Yes Aguero is absolutely a better player than either Vardy or Kane but they are performing at a reasonably similar level Aguero also has the luxury of playing in a side with De Bruyne Silva Sterling and loads of other world class attacking players
That s what the boss is trying to say and people are trying to make it into something else
Nope sorry Aguero when fit is in a tier of his own when it comes to PL strikers
Yep If you did a poll of who you could have today from those three you can safely assume 90 of people would pick Aguero
100
Too much ignorance for that
Only striker in the PL that can create chances out of nowhere and convert them efficiently
Stick to La Liga
I think its that fit that makes them better You can be an amazing player but if you can t manage to stay on the field what s the point Aguero is amazingly talented but always injured and never fit I d rather have someone I know is gonna be playing day after day at an above average level rather than someone who will play 4 games better than anyone else then end up on the bench for the next 4
Who you d rather have due to fitness is up to you though It doesn t change the fact that ability wise Aguero blows them both away Hence why he s regarded as a better player
Get out Poch No one in the league is on the level of a fit Aguero
He did use the word today three times
I assumed he mean today as in this moment in time this footballing epoch whatever Not like on this particular date
Yes and in this particular footballing epoch it s not a stretch to say they have been just as good Aguero isn t ahead of the pack at all this season although he has been in the past and undoubtedly could be again
I think you made my point for me An epoch wouldn t describe one season or day in isolation but a time period in which footballers are playing Or it could encapsulate a career In one moment you might be able to say Kane or Vardy are as good as Aguero but in a long period examination Aguero is better Obviously Kane has time to achieve and develop but we can t know how that will go
Fit Aguero is a contradiction
True But when a player is so regularly injured you can t just hand wave away that fact and only look at their form when fit Being injured is as much a part of Ageuro s profile as his goalscoring at this point
You re getting down voted but this is so true Players like Ag ero and Sturridge are absolutely lethal when fit The problem is they re injured so much that they rarely are very fit
Fit Daniel Sturridge would like a word
No he wouldn t
If we re talking about a fit Aguero then a fit Studge should also be in the equation
You are deluded if you think Sturridge is anywhere near Aguero
People have forgotten how amazing he is It s alright he ll come back and show them all how good of a striker he is
Then he ll promptly be out for another three months
Expect to see him in Feb 17 then
Sure But it doesn t change the fact that Aguero is way ahead
For 1 game
Imagine if Pardew said that
If Conor Wickham scored goals people would be talking about him instead of Ag ero I imagine it d be something along those lines
Poch Pellegrini Pep and Klopp are the only people I can imagine getting a free pass for this Anyone else would get laughed at
Today Can people not read Unless you re making the argument that they re not on the same level as Aguero this season but that s just plain wrong
I am in sales there is one guy who has done really well in previous years normally doing better than the others But this year he had one or 2 extra holidays and his season hasn t been perfect but there s these other 2 new guys who have been there consistently and are ahead of him in the stats They have brought more sales for the company this year so this year they are are least as good as him Now whether they will continue to be inn the same level next year is a different matter
Yeah I m well aware of what form is and how it can change but Poch said today he s talking about the present I don t understand why so many people in this thread are getting so defensive about Aguero In current form Vardy and Kane are bringing just as much if not more to their teams Maybe Aguero will blow them both out of the water next season or he has done in the past but the bottom line is that he s not doing that now
Yeah I m agreeing with you I m pretty sure they re all good and this season so far equally as good
In terms of value and importance to their respective clubs it s probably a fair statement That s about it though
Incorrect Aguero is a head and shoulders above the rest Metaphorically not physically
Head and shoulders above them in more ways than one considering he s club teammates with Joe Hart
I mean Aguero has played 800 minutes less than both of them with 7 less appearances and is below Kane by just two goals So we can easily rule Kane out of this one Vardy is a better example with 5 more goals than Aguero and an extra assist he also has a similar goals per shot conversion rating but it s likely all form right now who knows
Lol no Just no
Today In other words Vardy will be forgotten by this time next season Aguero will be winning more trophies
They are close Aguero may be more gifted but has a much worse recent injury record than Vardy or Kane

If you re going to get offended it should be that this guy hasn t done anything worthy of being compared to Beckenbauer Yet
Are you serious Offensive nickname It s his nickname in Brazil and himself said that it was the way they call him How is that offensive
Ah good ol PC reddit
He said slightly offensive and I wouldn t be surprised if some people did take offense so he s not really wrong
Well it s directed at Jemerson If he doesn t take offense I don t think anyone else should
Welcome to the the PC generation
Even if he don t find it offensive others would its based of his skin color which is racism edit Just to clarify I am not against it but some people would be offended if you called them that based their skin color
oh fuck off
Love you too
It s also purely descriptive and an amusingly horrible pun The point of racism is the implied intent of the distinction not the distinction itself
It s only offensive if he s more of a black Cruyff
We had a black player albeit with very light colouration in the late 80s early 90s called Mark Burke He was known as Sooty by our fans
The era of the chimneysweep was still alive and well in the northeast at that time
liverpool fans once called john barnes tarmac because he was the black heighway
If you guys don t like the nickname you are free to give him back to us please give him back
Blackenbauer
Yeah I read the tweet as well
Just there for those who can t be bothered looking
thank you I m at work and Twitter is blocked
I once heard a fan refer to Rooney as the White Pele I was sickened
zico exists
Not really a prestigious title anymore when players like Lucio Fl vio have been called that hahaha
I remember reading that Chris Samba liked to be nicknamed King Kong from the Congo
Ramires nickname at Cruzeiro was The Blue Kenyan
Everything is offense
Offensive Shit man that s that s hilarious as fuck
PC squad raids r soccer
bruhhhhhhh in latin America its actually not in the slightest sense racist to call someone negro Damn if he s Blackenbaur then he must be a sick player can t wait to watch him play
We ve been calling Tyler Blackett Blackenbauer for over a year now Guess it s ironic Compliments Smaldini well though
Reminds me of one of our players Dorlan Pabon was nicknamed by the Verdolagas Atletico Nacional fans Mem n after a famous and controversial comic strip character named Mem n Pingu n
Calling black people black is offensive now
OH NO They called him black lets start a riot and loot innocent people stores
Lmao
Get your political correctness bullshit outta here
It s only offensive it you think being called black is something bad
This chap will never be close to Blackettbauer
so offensive i got ptsd
That s great I remember people used to call David Silva El Chino for his kind of asian looking eyes Gotta love a borderline racist nickname
It s funny how being from South America it took me so long to realize how sensitive people are to words I was called negro or negrito my entire childhood and still sometimes by family and I m not even black just browner than most Had familled members called gordo flacco and we all didn t even think twice about it Our national team Ecuador is almost entirely black and we say stuff like negros all the time and absolutely no one thinks it s racist
I wonder if it s like that in Spain but in Portugal we tend to be the same
Not sure I have heard a lot about xenophobia in Spain though
Brazilian here exact same thing As a teenager every one of my friends had nicknames based on something we looked like My big nosed friend we called Cyrano one of our black friends we called Cirilo from Carrusel de las Am ricas I was fat people called me Faust o Brazilian tv personality There were lots of other nicknames like that not one of us gave a damn and we all laughed at each other and ourselves
Yeah I know what you mean People seemed to just have thicker skin in general It was all jokes and laughs its a pretty cool concept really Its like we were desensitized from a young age to the point where color of your skin height weight aren t really a big deal
Meh while calling a player El Chino for having small eyes is borderline racist calling a player Blackenbauer because he is actually black doesn t seem racist in the slightest to me The former relies on racial stereotypes whereas the latter doesn t
Silva wasn t called el chino for having small eyes He was called that because his mom is Asian although from Japan atleast heritagewise
Oh didn t know that I was just going off what the other guy said
In case you are interested here s a picture of Silva s family minus dad

That s depressing as hell
Ikr just like Diaby and Wilshere And probably Welbeck
Welbeck has had only one lengthy layoff Wouldn t consider him exactly injury prone
Exactly he hasn t had the prolonged exposure to the Arsenal physios necessary to pick up true injury prone ness yet It ll come though Just give the lad some time
Probably as in will probably turn out like that His return has been somewhat delayed let s face it
Yep This doesn t feel like 2 weeks
Somewhat eh Welbeck doesn t look too bad should be 2 weeks away 9 months later
Ah yes the age old we know better then medical professionals and football staff who do this and have been doing this for years thought process Maybe Wenger isn t rushing anyone back from injury something he tends not to do with his more important players But fuck me right I haven t been followin Arsenal for years or anything
Okay chill I wasn t saying I know better I am actually a long term Arsenal fan my other account is banned from the sub so I m in disguise and I understand that he doesn t want to rush anyone back from injury
And Sturridge
ledley king BibleThump
sigh
Really hoping he can stay fit for the Euros We really need him He makes us so much better Our whole system basically depends on having a 10 in the hole who can create
personally would rather see Ali play the 10 role over Wilshire
Well seeing how Rosicky is czech and I was saying us it s pretty easy to assume I am czech and not english
ooops thought your reply was to staplegun101 and seeing as you are talking English it was easy enough to make the mistake
I made the same mistake read ten replies about Welbeck right before Ksn0 s comment
A challenger approaches
What the hell do we feed our guys
Nothing apparently
The dude s leg was mangled by a horrific challenge and he never recovered from it
Bring back the Mars Bars
you d be better off listing the things he hasn t injured
That calf muscle
That leg and ankle breaking challenge
i doubt he even has hamstring now
Illness x2 is that it
If you re reading this Abou give this article a scan
One of those foot injuries was probably kicking John Terry s head
looool
Feets injuries are the worst
Feetses
I made one for Sturridge s injury
He has the most injury free right arm in the premier league
No problem with that right arm He has it physically and mentally fit to perform his start position of his goal celebration
haaaaa o dear
itt action shots goal celebration
Tomas Ro sickly
I would find these funnier if I didn t know the correct pronunciation sits key rather than sickey
It always bothered me that his name is pronounced Radzidski somehow
The Czech pronunciation is more like ROSS its kee
This is what we say in England the guy above you just pronounces it wrong
Michael Owen pronounces it Ross Sickey
Weirdly enough so does Wenger I mean you think he d know what with him being the manager and not being known for Joe Kinnear style mispronunciations
I only know it from the English commentators saying his name so
c makes a ts sound in Czech not too hard
Ro sick y is way more fun to say
That s dumb and ethnocentric of you Anyways Ive always heard it as Ro zit ski

Now I cant get that damn song out of my head
Do Robben do Robben http www transfermarkt co uk arjen robben verletzungen spieler 4360
Fuck two and half pages of injuries and all but four are from his time with Bayern the rest is from his time with Real
I thought it was widely known that Robben was given an Adamantium replacement some time after he joined Bayern
dont know what an adamantium is let alone that robben had his replaced
deleted
get out of here im trying to earn my cool internet points
it s just incomplete look at this http www goal com en news 15 german football 2010 08 05 2055932 goalcom special arjen robbens lengthy injury history
Thanks I don t know if that makes is better it didn t start with Bayern or worse always injured
He was injured a lot for Chelsea one of the reason he s got sold This cannot be complete
Yeah the list still looks ridiculous
Robben
Schnitzel Still one of my favorite players i ve ever seen in our colors
Seriously He and Koller were a fantastic duo to watch
Plus Ewerthon and Amoroso That wasone of the best attacks we ever had
Naaah this guy http www transfermarkt co uk ewerthon profil spieler 1396 Scored the decisive goal in our 2002 championship
Rosicky is and always will be my favorite player ever So smooth on the ball He always gives 100 and makes it look so damn pretty He could ve been a true club legend if he stayed healthy
The day Tomas left for you guys I was atleast as devastated as when G tze or Lewandowski left Such a talented player and I was certain he would become world class at Arsenal So sad he never got to show his full potential
I thought you where saying he was 53 not the amount of injuries
If it weren t for the injuries Rosicky would have been a world class player The guy has so much instinct paired with such a energetic and dynamic style of play Unplayable on his day
Happy now Admittedly I didn t notice it
Thanks babe x
A tottenham fan calling jack wilshere babe Now i ve seen everything
Have you seen Hazard score in the PL this year Because I haven t
3 of my favourite 5 players of this generation have been Rosicky Dean Ashton and Owen Hargreaves Injuries suck balls
That s an interesting choice of players
They all bring something totally or relatively unique in my opinion I guess I also have a penchant for the what might have been I m utterly convinced that Ashton would have brutishly dragged England to more success than they ve had over the last 10 years Rosicky would have been amongst the best players in the Prem and Hargreaves is just a damn shame that he took that much stick for so long I doubt many of those people even watched him at Bayern and then he goes and turns it on when the rest of the England team can t at a tournament and everyone U turns
I loved Alan Smith from his Leeds United days It s a shame his career pretty much flatlined after he broke his leg at Manchester United He s still playing somewhere in the lower leagues
I think Rosicky managed a pretty decent career despite the injuries and I would rate him pretty highly anyways when he hang up his boots unlike other players Diaby
Come on don t exaggerate most players are unplayable on their day whether their world class or not depends on how often that day occurs Injuries are a part of a player in the same way pace is it s like saying if it wasn t for his pace Heskey would ve been world class It s a pointless and irrelevant statement People need to stop throwing about world class like that
He wouldn t doesn t have the intelligence and awareness needed Definitely exciting though
He clearly has intelligence and awareness
Ouch right in the groins
This guy fucks
You dont tho
Best part of this is feets Like something gollum would says feetses
I had almost recovered from yesterday so thanks

In english foot is the singular word and feet is the plural Usually adding an s at the end would make it plural ball vs balls but this word is an exception As a fun fact the plural form of the animal moose is moose
Foot is the singular and feet is the plural the English language has bizzare grammar For instance sheep is both singular and plural
Even worse Goose s plural is Geese but Moose s plural is still Moose
Meese heh heh
Also it s spelled bizarre
No it is spelled i t
One of my favorite players ever shame he has had such an unbelievably bad luck with injuries
I made one for Sturridge but it was just a circle around his entire body
Rosicky is my favourite Arsenal player currently and probably my 2nd favourite of all time behind Henry The injuries that he s suffered is such a shame considering what a player he is Never stops working and is just the perfect style of player for Arsenal It s amazing how at 35 he still runs faster and longer than most players on the pitch Going to cry when he leaves in the summer
Can you please do this for sturridge
I can try It takes lot of time because of the research for that high amout of injuries
just put a bubble around his whole body and tag it fucked indefinitely
Love this guy It s so depressing to see what he s been through over the years I wonder how far he could ve got if it wasn t for all those injuries He s got all the talent in the world but damn is he made of glass or what
I d be really interested to see this for other injury prone players
Do Wilshere next
Wilshere s was already made by talkSport http talksport com sites default files styles large public unknown 0 png itok ceAA4GhM
Someone should update it according to that one he s been injury free since November 2014
on my way to do it
Be gentle
Sturridge if it hasnt been done if u have time
He s had two since November 2014 so it won t be the biggest of updates
Damn injured the same ankle 4 times in the same year How do you even do that is it just bad luck
It was probably reoccurrences of the same injury
That was my handy work Also did a Sturridge one and a Diaby one
theres a rumour that that he isnt actually injured but this has been prolonged to cover up his drugs addiction
He s no Adrian Mutu
lol
And the recurring problems and lay offs that he faced due to his ankles were just part of the elaborate hoax
Also there is zero substantial evidence to support that rumour One idiot one time said it on Twitter and people and media took it from there
He didn t even say it He just mentioned the word rehab about Wilshere rehabilitating from his injuries and it spread from there
Wow I bet it is really painful for him to get up in the morning
Some peoples bodies just weren t meant for the intensity of the sport at the level he plays at
Will he be fit for his testimonial That is the question
Well his necks still fine
Arsenal DNA
Maybe he should have left Arsenal to go to another league
Now do D Rose
Feets and Ankles
He should just retire tbh Great player but one of these days it s gonna kill him
Not enough recovery time Seriously I just skimmed and saw from Aug 2011 June 2012 he went back and forth with Groin Knee Thigh every couple months
Carrying on Diaby s legacy
He s a walking running disaster He s going to need to buy stock in Aleve when he gets older he s going to need it
might need 2 pages for sturridge and his injuries
lmao does he not stretch
You can make one for Wilshere as well It would look the same
Thats a lot of groin injuries
There s an italicized injury in the Achilles section that s sending my OCD bonkers for those future edits
good point but who knows maybe this was his last injury and he will retire at the end of the season so no future edit will be need
Mr Glass
Arsenal injuries seem to predominate with hamstring thigh and groin problems Makes me wonder if they focus enough on core training
He needs to stop using his groin
53 injuries and not one concussion Hope I didn t just jinx that
How much time has he missed in total
No broken fingers So he has bright future in music
He only got the flu once in all these years Damn
White Sturridge
Reminds me of somebody http 41 media tumblr com tumblr lbp87aNhe51qbh3dno1 500 png
I thought he was retired Tho someone probably made a voodoo out of him
Lies the graph says feets
Mc king
Why
He s like Arsenal s Darren Anderton
Poor lad isn t going to make it to 40 at this rate
Feets
Goose s plural is Geese but Moose s plural is Geese but Moose s plural is Geese but Moose s plural is still Moose
I think I had been waiting all my life for this but I just didn t know You have made me whole Rosicky Mr Glass
Mr Glass
Where did you find the information for this
I saw one of these for Keiron Dyer and it put this to shame
Wtf happened in 2013 1 illness and 6 injuries
Our whole system basically depends on having a 10 in the next month all I m saying is lets give the guy a chance
Wow
Wow and I thought Puyol had it bad
Calves
feets made me laugh
Feets Cutest thing ever
53
And who could forget Eduardo Goodbye leg
What is it about football that makes players more likely to be so injury prone Feel like it doesn t happen in basketball or even American football
Probably a lot more running with sharp turns and rapid acceleration Combined with a lot of body contact I d say basketball is decently similar in a way Lots of knee and ankle injuries for those players too
Since you have the dates could you include a timeline
He s got good strong hands I see
Now do Diaby
I think you missed out on his injuries during his youth
Do you have a Twitter account I can credit for using this
Do Marco Reus
That s grim very good player as well
Any truth in the rumour that his last lay off was to do with drugs
sources
One of a few http www goonersworld co uk forum viewtopic php t 9994 start 30
that s from 2009 and is incredibly sketchy
My favorite player EVER the vision he has is INSANE But the injuries oh the injuries Makes me feel really sorry for him because if you look at his every move on the pitch you see he wants to play you see the passion you see a fighter
Wow he s 53
deleted
r comedycemetery
I think he has had substance abuse issues and the club covers it up by saying he has an injury This way it isn t publicized and doesn t hurt his reputation or reflect poorly on the club
What lead you to that conclusion Actually curious
I like reading footballer bio autobiographies and one of them mentioned that when a player has a long series of confusing vague injuries that can come one after another it can come down to substance abuse issues I think this book was either The Secret Footballer or Ibras book I think it makes sense you have millions of dollars play for a massive club have almost unlimited access to pussy and drugs It can be hard to not get swept away I find it interesting that so many people on this sub believe in the use of PEDs at big clubs but toss aside any notion that players may have substance abuse issues Clubs want to protect their players for the most part and would t be jumping up and down with excitement and heading to the press if a situation like this unfolded The club just has to say the player is injured the fans and media usually wont question it and you can send a player to rehab under the guise of treatment for another injury or just hide the rehab stint all together
Thats actually baseless tinfoil hat conspiracy
Not at all
Lmfaoooo i hate arsenal good job mate
Least elastic player ever

Uh Correct me if I m wrong but these probabilities would have all the clubs stay exactly where they are right now on average since everyone will get the exact same results Surely you have to do some kind of weighting for their current positions in the table EDIT Here s an example of how it should look They ve given a strength rating for every team which is calculated week by week This is what they use as a weighting
Yeah this is a very limited analysis
It s not even really an analysis it s just showing the current table I don t understand what the point of the simulation is if there s no weighting
No it s not just showing the current table It s showing where teams could end up For example West Ham has a 1 chance of winning the league
assuming every team is equal though which is not true at all You re giving the same win chance that Man City have with Aston Villa which makes no sense
Yeah I don t see what advantage this has over just making numbers up on the spot That 1 number is almost entirely meaningless I mean I m not opposed to Monte Carlo methods such as these but the hard part isn t in simulating something 100 000 times The hard part and the part that lends credibility to the results is getting the probabilities right in the first place Lots of people have come up with very clever ways of calculating the probability of Man City beating Aston Villa for example including ELO rankings regression analysis and using gambling odds The OP s work skips over that part making the end result almost trivial
Thanks for the feedback
Thanks for that share That is definitely a better tool than what I ve made and answers exactly the same question that I wanted to They also have a 50 50 method which is pretty much the same thing that I did
No probs I saw the 50 50 option as well which answered a few of my own questions on what you d done too
I am wary to do any weighting like that especially since near the end of the season teams to be relegated usually try harder I think that I am looking at the results a bit different than you first comment since they are all frequencies that can be interpreted as probabilities 2 4th place could be any of the teams vying for it right now Even though Tottenham is currently third it is equally likely that City or Arsenal end up as third
Maybe i m missing something but 100000 times a 50 50 simulation will cancel each other out right Isn t weighing necessary to have a result which says something about the results in the premier league
Arsenal and Tottenham currently have the same points so them having the same chance of ending third is no surprise City dropping two could be a quirk of the sampling rate If you repeated it you d probably get a different result there You don t necessarily have to weight by table position although that would be easiest if not most accurate but random chance would be way more inaccurate
So what I m seeing here is that there s a chance for us to win the league Cocks out boys we re gonna win the league
Also from what I understand it s more like 35 at home 35 draw 30 away
I m running this one right now Results in 10 mins or so haha
Excellent you could also include each teams current wDw and use the amended data per the simulations Although that could take a while
With those probabilities http imgur com NAMVNx9
My 8 1 on Leicester winning is looking pretty tasty then
Would take 7th again if the cups go to teams already in Europe and we get another crack at europa
When I saw the title I thought this was a chart showing the occurrences of diving for a moment
as a validation can you use the same model and set it to Christmas Day 2014 and project out the remainder of the 2014 season and the 2015 season until today Just replace the relegated teams with the promoted teams Who would be in first in that scenario Who would be in last in that scenario
Don t know what to make of this with my simple brain all I can see is a pretty pattern
haha same
I chose a probability of 0 5 for a draw 0 25 for one team to win and 0 25 for the other team to win I then simulated the rest of the season 100 000 times and the figure has the frequencies that each team lands in a certain place For example in all 100 000 simulations Leicester never finished below 7th Leicester s 7th bar is invisible due to the fact that they only finished 7th once What does all this mean Well Leicester has about a 50 chance of finishing first and Villa will almost definitely be relegated And Everton will finish midtable Are there any other game probabilities that I should try
Could you maybe weigh the probabilities so that the currently higher ranked teams are more likely to beat lower ranked ones Or maybe take into account their last meeting or something I have like zero idea how you would go on about doing something like that so it might be completely unfeasible just an idea
Thanks that s something I ll try to work out
Interesting look though I would argue 0 25 doesn t make a ton of sense as it basically gives Man City at home the same chance as Aston Villa away
It s more of a mathematical look someone asked a little while ago where Leicester could conceivably end up Doing it this way was the easiest way I could get an easily interpretable answer with so many matches and interplay between teams at the top
That s fair The current split for this PL season is H 0 39 D 0 29 A 0 32 Perhaps it might be worth looking simulating with these figures
http imgur com NAMVNx9 is with H 0 35 D 0 35 A 0 3
I don t know enough about modelling results to make a specific recommendation but I do know that those probabilities aren t too accurate for a start draws are closer to 30 than 50 Some kind of rating system e g this can estimate probability of match results but I don t think that there is an easy way to translate that well to your format
Thanks for the share They give match odds which is what I would need I ll play around with it
The ELO system is indeed a solid starting point The site s author explains some of the formulas he uses to calculate match odds here Keep up posting if you update your algorithm A champions league simulation would be quite interesting as well
How would it work out with say 0 4 home win and 0 3 for away win and draw
Yeah this seems to make more sense Intuitively only one in 5 games end in a draw Setting 0 5 games to draw gives a much bigger advantage to having a lead
8th place Sounds about right with the current squad s form
In that you are 8th now
When we slide into 2nd place on matchday 38 you will be proven wrong

They might want to take a look at the Serie A
One plays upfront for United m8
lots of sweat thats for sure
To MLS
He s a football agent nowadays Puyi for ever
Ashley Williams From what little Ive watched of Swansea he seems like a great leader
I get the sense that his body is keeping together on pure will alone when he retires I d imagine him just falling to pieces Nothing can keep him from playing easily Swansea s most impotant player
I rate Fonte as a leader
Lots o blood was shed at the Emirates
he s a class act without we looked lost against liverpool perhaps there are better defenders in the league based on ability but i think his role is more than that he s vital
Diego Godin plays for Atletico
Yeah I miss them too From an Everton point of view Jags is nice but he doesn t inspire fear in the opposition or the refs and he doesn t grab big games by the scruff of the neck like Big Dunc used to I guess the fact captains have to be media friendly has meant it s better to have a good talker represent a club now Duncan went 10 years without doing a single interview but there s no chance you d get away with that now
We just decided to not renew his contract
Not allowed bleed on the pitch anymore sure
LA
It makes me wonder who will take the England captaincy when Rooney eventually retires None of the young crop really seem to be captain material apart from perhaps Kane
I d go with Joe Hart Seems to be a good leader he s very vocal and he s a keeper on the right side of 30 so he has plenty of time unless Butland overtakes him
If its in a couple years Cahill will probably be gone too Maybe hart if Roy s keen on keeper captains or maybe Henderson
Shaw
If he keeps his spot I d reckon Hendo is a natural candidate He s certainly loud and passionate but doesn t really get to lead by example playing under Woy
Now it is quite a stretch that Wilshere will stop being always injured I think he has the passion to be a captain in a few years Eventually he s hopefully going to calm down a little bit but he s definitely a blood sweat and tears player
Eric Dier has more than a decent shout He s got exactly the attitude I d want in a captain
I think either Stones or Smalling would do a passable job in the future just not on the level of Rooney or previous holders
I m not entirely certain what Rooney has done to merit calling him a good captain A good player for England certainly but I can t think of any real moments of leadership from him
I remember reading about him getting the England team together to discuss the direction they wanted to go in or something similar and you only hear praise about him as captain from people in the England camp but yeah I suppose they would hardly say otherwise
Dier
Henderson
They ve gone no where
No bias here but England made a shit call by banning Terry from the team he s a true captain and a very good one I think he s the last of his kind in the premier league But the serie a still has plenty
Why s he banned from the team
Deserved a recall for the World Cup probably deserves a recall for the Euros aswell
Totally agree considering the fact that a lot of our English defenders are underperforming and he s still playing well for us easily our best defender this season Edit I mean Chelsea best defender this season
Just sold to a team in China Qatar
Adrien Silva
Deeney
he s our coach now
