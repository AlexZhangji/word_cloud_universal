Every time there is a balance patch I get nervous and almost every time I am happy with how blizzard handled it So glad they didn t do the spore nerf
Thank the lord I m not even a zerg player but I feel like the current spore is needed because of the lack of a good anti air solution from zerg and that hasn t changed since HOTS
In reality the nerf only impacts ZvZ but I am also glad it didn t go through DH showed a lot of variety in the ZvZ meta I thought
Mutas absolutely still have a place as a viable opener because ravagers can t actually hit well micro d mutalisks If spores were nerfed we d just have the old ZvZ meta which was muta vs muta slapfests It was fun to play for a while but when all the ZvZs were the exact same ling bane muta it gets a bit boring to play
Agreed
I play Z and I absolutely hate mutas I would have died if the spore was nerfed
Because Zerg had good anti air options in WoL D
The interesting thing here is how much this reminds me of BW Remember how if one of the zerg players went hydra lurker vs muta ling the korean commentators would go oh this matchup is pretty much over Here in LotV I have no idea what the outcome of such a confrontation would look like but the interesting issue remains alike and that is the hydras cannot be everywhere and meanwhile the mutas are darting in and out harassing anywhere and everywhere they can be
Mutad are already very viable in ZvZ don t know why they even tested it Happy it did not go through
Ya I love the feedback and the listening to the community It s way better than it was in WoL or HotS
hi bot
Wow that was fast And I m glad they re ditching the spore crawler change after we saw some great ZvZ muta presence this past weekend
That was pretty quick
Probably wanted to give pros a heads up so the ones going to IEM Taipei had a chance to adjust
and winter regional qualifiers
True though those are already going on
The ones that are ongoing only have like 1 2 matches left anyways I think
When will the patch go live on regular ranked ladder
They said the 28th in the Community Feedback
Well they promised that the patch was rolling out on the 28th in the last community update There would have been hell to pay if they failed to roll out a patch on or before then
I m a little worried about PvZ it s really tough to hold Zerg all ins But we ll see I guess it might just mean we have to play differently
Pretty much it boils down to the same opener I ve decided where you build 4 phoenix to stop muta and then non stop build immortals and upgrades until you get to the lategame
Dont immortals get wrecked by hydra What kind of supply you aiming at before transitioning Zerg here so not familiar
Depends If you scout roach hydra then you start producing heavy on ground army If you scout air you mass more phoenix before transitioning I usually tech to storm archon either way so my comp can fight almost anything including an ultra transition Pretty much you gotta see if the zerg is going to base all in or try to play a macro game with you
Awesome cheers So I assume you open single stargate phx and robo after third depending on what you scout Also what would your ratios of phx void zealot adept archon templar immortal disruptor be against a zerg who seems to be going roach hydra but isn t clearly committing to a big allin e g more relevant in the lower leagues they re building an army and taking bases and could decide to allin pressure at any moment Finally if you playing 2v2s against a Z T team how would the composition change assuming zerg is roach etc t is bio Thanks in advance for sorry for the question spam I m decent as Zerg diamond but got NFI how to play Protoss coherently short of mass sky or random yolo troll styles
Double stargate usually but thats considering you get phoenix harass in I ve been opting for a couple of adepts early on for base protection and securing fast thirds Adept harass can really help you gauge how strong they are and their composition Honestly if you can buy time mass voidray and carrier is really strong It takes 3 bases though and if they all in you have to micro your early void oracle really well They key to beating ravager all ins though is lots of immortal production You could just assume the opener is 2 star 2 robo twilight temp tech tech The build I was following was from a progame I can t recall who He opened double star and then stalker
Thanks again How would you get upgrades on 2 3 base with this Also how many gateways you aiming for on 2 or 3 base to support this
I add gates depending on my composition More gates for heavier ground army Keep adding gates when you get into the lategame for better remax Usually try to grab 3 attack and some air upgrades for lategame The 3 ground is so when you remax after a big fight you can make a ton of archons and your ground army will be very tough This is strictly PvZ though
Perfect thanks
Ultras are terrible units vs chargelot archon immortal The real problem is trying to kill a defensive Z before broodlords get out because pushing into good defensive lurkers is really hard which is good otherwise Z just straight up dies to chargelot archon immortal before broodlords
But hydra get wrecked super hard by storm and disruptors one of which you should have before the hydra numbers get out of control
wow you may not be able to triple expand riskless
as a bronzie i think i should shut up about this
If Trump can run fro president you can damn sure shout Bronzie opinions from the fucking rooftop Go for it young Terran
I THINK ADEPT SHOULD GET MORE DAMAGEEEEE I will leave now
pvz is going to be frustrating
PvZ is already frustrating
True
I hope the next step is toning down Ravager Bile I d love to see what a casting range decrease would do and PvZ could be in a good spot
I think a damage reduction vs buildings would be a nice change especially in a ZvP
I don t care about ravagers lurkers is a pain in the ass I think it should be Hive tech
Thing is in tournaments there s not a lot of games where lurkers look un manageable disruptors shit on them Making ravagers slightly less strong against protoss could have a snowball effect that makes everything that come after more manageable anyways which often happens when tinkering with early game units
I guess that sounds reasonable
Then every zerg would die to a 3 base charge archon immortal protoss push in every game It is litterally the only thing that allows zerg to survive to hive
And they re fucking awesome I switched to zerg in LotV for 2 reasons it s the only race I haven t hit masters with and lurkers are badass as fuck If they take away lurkers I have to go back to being an all in protoss or a whiny terran C
You should seriously try phoenix into chargelot archon immortal It shits on Lurkers especially if the Zerg is attacking with them Phoenix can lift up Lurkers and archons immortals destroy them as well I face this all the time in KR and it s strong Stalker disruptor not very good versus it imo
Might as well make it a melee ability then Damage nerf is be better I think
Current range is 9 that s huge There s room for toning it down without making it short
Can you shorten the bile range without making the Ravagers a useless counter to well placed Liberator harass
That s an issue yes ravagers are needed to defend against liberators but when the roles are reversed and the ravagers attack they just shit on libs and tanks
So long as ravagers are the only viable counter to liberators until T3 then they absolutely cannot be nerfed in any way
They can t do this because of liberator range ie bunny s build The only way for zerg to deal with liberator range is ravager bile or air units It s poor design for liberators to force a zerg to go air tech when that is not their tech path of choice
Vs ranged liberator cheese openings that can t be scouted no range 9 is fine
I always thought the bile CD would be the best way to tone down the ravager You keep the ability to defend against libs and you can still kill them with the same number of biles when they harrass but they re more manageable later on
That makes a lot of sense actually would like to see them try something like this
I personally think a small casting delay on Bile would be nice
The longass delay before damage isn t enough
Yeah these nerf ravager posts are completely moronic There is literally zero pro players complaining about Ravagers They are simply not a problem I guess I could throw up a Terran flair and start whining about tank nerfs or something too
They can t do this because of liberator range ie bunny s build
Make it less stackable If you can t oneshot Pylons now the PO nerf won t matter that much for defending allins In big fights you mostly spread them out anyway
Damn Well I guess we don t need the TvZ ZvP TvP show matches if this is going live If Blizzard is still looking at potentially adding the spore change I have Snute and TLO willing to do a ZvZ show match this week I ll keep ya ll posted
I don t know possible it is but it d be great if you could get it out before patch probably not possible im assuming it hits tomorrow morning during maintenance A lot of people are iffy on the spore change
I d still be interested in the PvT and PvZ to see how the changes have affected those matchups
I love the comments Terrans complaining that their race is broken and weak protoss saying that this nerf will kill them zergs saying that the PB nerf will make them die to air so in a nutshell every race is UP and OP at the same time
Schroedinger s Race
Brilliant
So nothing new
The thing is all of these things are kind of true Terran have been suffering from a pure balance standpoint Their win rates are low in both matchups and PvT is downright frustrating for them All the changes in this patch should give them some more room to do their thing which is good Protoss have been relying on heavy Photon Overcharge usage to counter the strength of Zerg all ins and general economic harass And heavy Adept pressure to limit the army advantage of Terran in the mid game I see it as taking away stilts from the 5 6 guy in a basketball game Sure the stilts were unfair but now he s a fucking 5 6 guy in a basketball game Zerg still struggles with air compositions even with the power of PB which could outright cause other players to not use air in their compositions In the end all of these changes are GOOD changes because they were little bits of too much making up for other flaws But now we get to see the other flaws and hopefully it ll all shake out for the best
Only one of these races has data support for the UP position
Not at the same time At different times or rather at different stages of a game Against different matchups
PvZ be prepared for the return of the Skytoss
Did carriers get buffed Don t they still take 90 years to make Bomb really never did much to carriers
No buff to carriers still too long of a build time and still not viable in most circumstances
I have been experimenting with going carriers in every game so far I can get to high M with em but it s really difficult
Shouldn t you bomb the interceptors
You cannot cast parasitic bomb on the interceptors themselves anymore if that is what you meant
Ah it was too strong I m guessing
same reason why BCs are not used
I doubt skytoss will return
Should just release on the 26th for everywhere except Korea where they can release it on the 28th like planned due to matches
Can blizzard please acknowledge the Disruptor aggro bug Are they even aware of it
Pretty sure they re aware but it s under not game breaking well get to it eventually
It really is a drastic change Playing with mutas vs the nerfed spores was amazing since you could actually harass with a reasonable amount of mutas Defending it was pretty difficult Mass queen seemed to do well but I feel that leaves you open to mass expanding or passive transitions I don t think it s the right change when mutas are as strong as they are now I also don t like that the spore hard counters them as hard as they do but it seems necessary
Really excited for the viper change I still enjoy a heavy muta style and or late game 40 muta switches 60 dmg parasitic bombs means you need more than 2 bombs ticking on each muta every tick in order to kill any one of them Before it was only 1 1 2 bombs making a 2 parasitic bomb hit nearly impossible to prevent muta s death By the time you pull out the 2 mutas they all still die haha Now if I pull back after 2 bombs go off they ll all live if 3 I ll still may have time to keep the rest majority of my flock alive Also can t wait to basetrade protoss again Nothing more frustrating than having an 150 supply army lose to 8 Pylon Overcharges and a warp in Looking forward to the patch
Or your scouting overlord dying to a pylon and that being a good use of energy
depending on the timing and what toss scouts out of the zerg still a good use of energy
I played a ZvZ where I was behind in muta vs muta but managed to sneak out 4 vipers with PB I was more mineral starved than gas starved I guess I figured out afterwards that ended up being about 2 3 vipers more than I actually needed to turn the tide in my favor Since the damage stacks it creates crazy overkill potential If you force a muta vs muta fight and can land PBs then even if they split they are probably taking mutas out of the fight and cause a favorable engagement for the person without PB even if they are significantly behind in mutas I think that s why the even though the damage change is heavy it is still going to be a really powerful spell you still need to split and that even perfectly splitting takes away a lot of your advantage at least for mutas which don t have a lot of range For the majority of players who probably can t split well enough anyway it will at least tone down how ridiculously fast it can melt an airball
Should be a good iteration of the game I m interested in seeing how tvz and tvp develop after this and the potential liberator nerf that might be needed
That s not how it works 1 less damage from the Adept is a really REALLY big deal because it passes the Marine HP breakpoint Saying build 1 more Adept and it s the same is completely wrong because this statement assumes your Adepts put out a concentrated stream of DPS ignoring break points and overkill Currently a Marine without combat shields has 45 HP and an Adept does 23 damage per shot In two shots the Adept kills the marine 46 dmg to 45 hp After the patch an Adept does 22 damage per shot Two shots only does 44 damage leaving the marine with 1 HP This is a BIG DEAL it requires a whole extra shot to kill the Marine If we are considering a pure Adept army vs a pure Marine army the Adepts just got 50 less effective they take 1 5x as much time to kill the marines as they used to So the DPS of the Adept might only have gone down a tiny bit but because it passes the Marine HP breakpoint it s a huge effect
Don t forget it also needs 3 shots for an scv now
ya i think its appropriate though not everything should hit like a DT
Also keep in mind upgrades With 1 attack the adepts will be as powerful as they are now However none of the current adept early pressures have 1 So this is basically an early game adept nerf that will deal with warp prism or regular gateway pressure plays Those plays will still be good in the mid game once you have 1 but it should be easier to defend for T because you won t have to lose SCVs earlier
That s what im saying I quoted the first comment from the battle net forums
Also stim now hurts more than it helps for marine vs adept until you have combat shields
and it was all about the SCV s I really hope that Protoss still is able to trade cost efficent with a terran without the need to rush tec Terrans will always have the mobility let us have the efficiency
The time of us having cost efficency just ended Back to needing to rush tech or timings
In mid late game they will still need 3 shots to kill shield marines anyway This nerf mostly affects early game
Actually it still makes a difference with shields since right now adepts will 2 shot marines with shields if they stim It only stops mattering after 1 if the Terran does not have better upgrades
To be more specific 1 damage will allow Adepts to 2 shot Marines unless they have 2 armor this scenario should never happen unless a Forge was sniped while upgrading 2 damage will always 2 shot stimmed no shield Marines regardless of upgrades
After the change 1 damage on Adept does not allow them to 2 shot a Marine with 1 armor The only way an Adept returns to its 2 shot status is if Toss is ahead on upgrades If they re even the Marine takes 3 shots Edit Wait I think I m wrong Adepts get 2 damage against light for each upgrade Disregard
Yeah adept damage will be 10 12 and upgrades will stay 1 1 Darn tricksy protosses
Yeah because units deal big chunks of other units HP in damage this is why slight HP buffs are such a big deal Even if the health gained or in this case damage lost is not much compared to the previous number the amount of shots required to kill the unit on the other hand makes a big difference This is why CS is such a big deal For instance lets say you re fighting Banshees A banshee needs two shots to kill a marine but three to kill a marine with combat shield Despite gaining slightly more than 20 more HP the marine is 50 more resilient in this case so it s almost equivalent to the marine getting 50 more health for all intents and purposes Roaches are another exemple the take 3 shots to kill a marine or 4 with CS so it s a 33 survival increase Hell DT are probably the most extreme case they take two shots rather than one shot meaning marines have a doubled effective health So in the end it really isn t about how much the numbers have changed but about their practical effect in a combat scenario That 1 damage difference effectively makes marines 50 tougher in the early game where the adept is problematic but it has a negligible effect in late game confrontations where the adept is fine
The change only really affects Adepts until they have 1 attack at which point they will be able to 2 shot the same things they do now It s an early game change only But just like saying just get 1 more adept saying just get 1 attack is missing the point of why this is a huge change as you say Early adept attacks are currently strong because they can do things with ONLY 2 adepts and WITHOUT a forge
From what I ve read in analysis this effect disappears the moment protoss researches 1 ground weapons Even if terran researches 1 armor Both for marines and scvs So this is mostly to curb down adept all ins including the prism all in as it would require 1 to reach the same effect and thus be delayed and map control to some extent
I m just going to add in that this change only affects the adept marine relationship before any upgrades except adept attack speed Once adept get 1 attack upgrades they ll two shot marines Once marines get shields they will die in 3 shots both pre and post patch
Yeah Adept can get 1 attack but Terran can get 1 armor As for shields marines will still die in 3 shots but if they ve been stimmed they STILL take 3 shots to kill previously only took 2 Gotta consider all the upgrades coming into play Edit I think I m wrong Adepts get 2 damage vs light with each upgrade Bummer for Terrans
It takes 2 armor to negate 1 I belive
i wonder if adding an oracle to adept pushes will be effective now It deals a constant stream of damage with its beam so potentially it can quickly kill off all the 1 hp marines scvs left after 2 shots from the adept
You ll have to add a stargate to the push which either means you re pushing with fewer adepts or later into a stronger defense and an opponent who hasn t faced as much pressure
In the mid game not much is altered A marine with combat shields needs 3 adept shots to kill Pre nerf and post nerf adepts will always take 3 shots to kill a combat shielded marine so mid game interaction is left mostly untouched They didn t nerf adept attack speed so 50 attack speed adepts will still do great against combat shielded marines in a straight on engagement It just won t be as one sided since marines after a stim back down to 45 health won t be easy prey The power of recent PvT builds also hinges on forgoing upgrades for more gateway units or faster tech since adepts do not benefit greatly from 1 attack Now getting an upgrade lead on a terran allows protoss to two shot workers a huge advantage considering how effective adept harass has shown itself to be
Exciting When does this fo live
You guys are sick Keep it up
Good to see that DK came to his senses and threw out the proposed spore crawler nerf Keep it up
I wish they d have tested adjusting the adept more I m still not convinced the damage was the problem In my opinion the mobility and vision of the shade was the problem
So Thor change and siege tank change from the table Raven
Not really up to date with sc2 Isn t this a pretty good thing
I hope the patch goes live today I have no motivation to play with the current outdated game
Has the mod been updated to this
Thank fuck they didnt include the spore nerf I wasn t looking forward to pure muta vs muta especially the whoever rushes muta the fastest wins kind Rest looks good though
protoss is gonna get shat all over in tvp The matchup was broken on both sides but blizz only fixed one Liberator ghost armies are untouchable
If thats the case it will be patched too Also liberator ghost is probably one of the most expensive things I can think of for terran
I m not talking pure liberator ghost I just mean 4 10 liberators and 3 ghosts with a bio ball This is a composition you can comfortably get off of 3 bases and if the protoss does not have tempests they hardly ever can win a fight
Liberators in general are so frustrating for protoss in the lower leagues If you don t have air units ready good luck being able to shoot them with stalkers By the time you get void ray phoenix they get shut down with marines
Everything is frustrating for lower leagues
You re right It s a brutal frustrating game but that s why I like it Starcraft is not for casuals Things like muta switches or endless bio drops are understandably frustrating but nothing makes me rage like having a liberator sitting behind your mineral line out of pylon range when the only AA you have are a few stalkers that can t reach it without getting obliterated
Nah man flying my factory in their base building Mines and then killing all his workers is not
GG PvZ This is a disgrace
Im toss and i really like this changes from a design point of view The only thing that i dislike is that it forced us to double stargate pretty hard And i hope we can do somethign about that in the future
Man i am scared i am a protoss player and i always have trouble with speedlings until i learned to proper position my pylons and use PO but now that we have half of charges i think zerg can abuse it pretty easily with his unit mobility
Did you play Protoss in WoL A mistake in building placement or unit hold position was an auto loss Man I switched to terran at the wrong time
Has the patch been relased yet
Glad they don t plan to implement the spore change I hope they look at tanks next TvT is killing me So this patch comes out on thursday
damn I can already taste protoss tears welling up
Don t worry we ll be downvoted to oblivion by anti protoss bias until we get more nerfs We re near 40 in ZvP and this pylon overcharge nerf is going to make Roach Ravager pushes insanely stronger Pylons are so easy to snipe with corrosive bile and now that it costs 50 energy we re super fucked I hope you like the taste
i still think it s blizzard s fault for coming up with attacking pylons they are stuck with it and so they are desperately trying to make it viable
That is the story of Protoss in Starcraft 2 Forcefield and MsC have been band aids for poor design
Protoss is definitely the worst race design There has always been the massive problem of defenders advantage with protoss because the game is balanced around warp in mechanics Terran has longest range units and sim city for their defense and zerg has creep and queens Protoss always just had to make due with whatever quick fix blizzard gave them forcefield and msc
I completly agree about the original sin about the defender advantage But since LotV where the warpgate has been finally strongly nerfed you could have strong gateway units again like in BW I m dreaming of a world where pylon overcharge and force field disappears completly as they are bad design And they could buff gateway units gets as a tradeoff That was not possible because of warpgate before but now they can do it
They did buff gateway units Look what happened
They didn t buff any of the existing gateway units They added a gateway unit that is really strong with the buffed warp prism They buffed a midgame zealot upgrade That s it Stalkers still suck Zealots are still weak early Sentries take all of your gas and are useless because of the buffed shooting pylon
I agree with everything you said My point is that the adept buffed gateway centric play and now they are scaling it back a bit
Gateway centric aggressive play Adept gateway still sucks shit at defending early vs roaches or marauders without overcharge
would you trade your MC for a shield battery just curious
I honestly think that instead of PO Pylons should grant a bonus to either shield armor and or shield recharge while a protoss unit stands in their power field I mean zerg has home field advantage with creep terran can set up really good simcity defenses but PO allows defense with basically no units shouldn t defense imply actually having units to defend
sim city can be used by all races though zerg use evo chambers to funnel hellions and toss wall off the natural for fast expo that being said im not against the PO changing to buff units as it still means toss has to scout and have actual freaking units rdy to defend
P and T simcity are for two different things T simcity is to allow seigetank liberator to poke from max range P simcity is only about controlling zerglings and new in LOTV maximizing pylon surface area at the front
First time I ve seen that suggested but it s really good idea actually Get rid of photon overcharge and give pylons an automatic shield recharge ability to units and buildings in its radius Encourages the protoss to build units to defend rather than just rely on cheap abilities
Even if you did that Protoss would get shit on by early all ins To make the pylon shield recharge ability viable early game it would be broken mid and late game
If it was strong enough then sure It would have to be comparable strength to like bunkers which are insanely strong due to repair and low commitment due to salvage
That s debatable since pylons also give supply If you need PO to activate this hypothetical buff then sure but if it s passive it might be stacking up to 5 or so but not too strong
The people who downvote only due to race are idiots Anyways the problem wasn t pylons when an attack comes to the front door with ravagers it s that protosses can sit in their base with the MSC and be perfectly safe from any counter harass A zerg run by usually only consists of 10 20 lings or 5 or so roaches which get murdered by pylon overcharge A 5 zealot run by requires 6 8 roaches to deal with proper micro Obviously some races should excel at things better than others but permanent overcharge safety wasn t fun and offered little to punish protoss for moving out Unfortunately while this nerf helps with that like you mentioned it s going to make the actual pushes harder to defend and the only thing I can think of is to change bile to 50 damage vs buildings
What I am worried about is how this will affect early liberator strategies that often depended on photon overcharge to defend it unless you just went stargate first Liberators tuck themselves in a corner so they only target 2 mineral patches but that is enough to make it very hard for stalkers to defend it on some maps
Or maybe use the great insight you mentioned All defense should require unit control of some kind Currently the all purpose PO can be used defensively or offensively because of the way the MSC works This unit was put in the game to give protoss some early game poking potential against zerg by privaledge of recall Poke a bit do some dmg or threaten to do so then recall back and turtle It was pretty elegant but still not enough Then overcharge debuted and essentially filled that niche twice Now that the WP and adept have stepped into the meta it is aparent that protoss can have some potency without recall but still requires PO Its a bit of a shame that the WPadept meta couldnt develop more and somehow seek some balance But the reality is that it in combination with PO limits terran far too effectively to stay unchanged I welcome the nerf and hope that it allows terran and toss to have more than 1 strat in this MU The question remains though can toss defend against zerg w o PO I don t think they can unless their offense becomes their defense I think that PO being nerfed gives toss the window to show blizzard how we can utilize the race defensively without need of the spell with units and strong micro but simultaneously dread the thought of more losses vs the very potent rorava timings I would like to see in the future of protoss PO removed from the game entirely the zealot and the stalker to recieve an early game utility buff to compensate and for stasis trap to become a more interesting keystone in how protoss pull off defense I sort of wish the sentry took a stronger role as a defensive unit also That at home it had some fortifying ability that helps preemptively defend against drops Such as the sentry can recall a unit to its location Spell is channeled and cancelled with dmg Being in a power grid makes it cost half the energy per unit Maybe scale the energy cost per unit type 1 4 energy for gateway units 3 4 for a robo unit So effectively 5 6 sentries could recall a majority of protoss army Units being recalled are vulnerable and immobile At least then toss has the ability to push and defend with units that need micro and cost money and a spell that needs foresight Moreover multiple sentries at each base gives the protoss the flexibility to fortify all 3 bases or just 1 base depending on the kind of drop instead of slugging an MSC to the drop sight then following the inevitable carnage It also requires good scouting which IMO should be the best and most reliable way to subdue incoming harassment Lastly offensive sentries could be used to refortify an army after a succesful defense but would lose all of their energy in doing so which makes them effectively dead weight in a fight
Yeah they get murdered by pylon overcharge but that s because the protoss army is slow as balls and won t be able to home and defend in any realistic timeframe While the zerg has a queens a creep network and fast units the protoss only has warp in which got nerfed And since gateway units are kinda shitty it makes perfect sense that protoss needs a bit more help dealing with harass
That pylon overcharge buys plenty of time for the protoss to get back to the base especially when the MSC has full energy
Yes that s my argument Pylon overcharge is necessary to buy time
its sad but true with corrosive bile hitting buildings this is gonna be a pain to hold
Yep it feels like Stargate will be the go to opener in pvz That s assuming it s not a 1 base Roach ravager rush which I m not sure how strong that will be if at all
Still won t be as much as T whines with a positive winrate
not sure how T can whine any more since adepts are nerfed how adepts destroyed bio was the biggest problem but now it s over T is very strong now
Wait one week
optimist I see
T never stops whining Even when T has a 70 winrate in TvP and TvZ then T whines that they play too much TvT
8 armor Ultras are still sick against Terran
yeah but so are liberators against mutas all races need some OP shit
I m barely seeing anyone acknowledge the adept change I m assuming that s because terran will still need something to complain a out after they lose
Warp prisms will be the next gripe
They took their time but I think these are the balance changes that most people wanted
regarding the overcharge 15 seconds 1 25 attacks per second 12 attacks each attack is 30 damage so 12x30 360 total damage its 360 damage for 25 energy or 360 25 14 4 damage per energy for the new version just copy the numbers except 20 seconds and 1 25 becomes 1 to get 600 50 12 damage per energy by the numbers that means its nerfed in damage but not very much 2 damage per energy and its not as spammable that makes this far more strategic since now you can t spam 7 overcharges and defend a large roach attack with a handful of adepts lets see the roach pushes boys edit of course this doesnt reflect on being able to run and hold out the overcharge which is now less spammable this change could be big but its good now you cant 3 base and tech up so easily
Well 3 base and tech up easily got us up to around 40 in PvZ Now let s the where that goes
I think the most important note is that pylons are easily snipeable with ravagers I predict PvZ being even more zerg favored in the near future
It s Likely it will be for the first month 6 weeks but i think this is a very good step towards balancing if this nerf proves to be to much they can look into buffs elsewhere to hopefully bring Protoss back into line that said i am pretty sure what we are gonna see is a meta shift into more unit based defensive builds with a msc for back up as opposed to the reverse which is exactly where we are atm especially now that this change opens toss up to more harassment through drops banshees muta and the like which imo is a good thing for everyone
Yeah this is basically certain
We need a way to buff pvz without affecting pvt
I don t think the Spore change and the viper change should be put in around the same time As much as I like playing muta styles I say let s see how the meta is after the Viper nerf before we decide to re nerf the spore
there s no need to nerf the spore it s already weak the biggest advantage of the muta style is the mobility even with todays spores you need quite a lot of them otherwise they will just be focused down pb nerf is ok imo
Can someone please explain the difference between duration and weapon period I m unsure what the difference is between the two
Duration is how long the overcharge is active on the pylon Weapon period is how much time is between each attack
Weapon period would make more sense being called attack delay
Ohhh ok interesting Thank you

There s the tears LET ME TASTE EM
I don t usually get matched up against Gold leaguers sorry boss
Well let me know when you get out of low silver I can train you to get you up to where you still won t be any challenge against me
Dank Can smell a guy who s played 10k games and never made GM once
Whatever happened to the proposed change to reduce or remove the Disruptor shot s bonus shield damage
They seem pretty sensible changes adepts don t two shot scvs photon overcharge can t wipe a whole army and parasitic bomb isn t quite so crazyI haven t played sc2 in a while uh Game looks slightly different
Let me catch you up to speed The mothership was really op so they gave Terran a planetary core and Zerg a broodmother core Then protoss was balanced which made Dustin Browder mad so now you have this
Haha this is great
Still killed the SCVs slower than Adepts
Replace pylons with adepts and thats what TvP felt like last patch
but we already have the warp prism adeptlord gif what if we combined them
A core that shoots pylons that are overcharged and summon adepts with every shot who in turn fire mothership cores
RIP my ears
I almost fulfilled the lycan prophecy when I clicked on that link holy poop
David Kim This kind of criticism doesn t help
There is some truth to every positive and negative comment Mothership core is a band aid unit and is ruining the game at least in all PvX matchups anyway
Why though I agree that pylon cannons needed a nerf and chuckled at this post but there s been much hate for the Mothership Core long before LotV Is there a convincing argument for removing the unit Or am I just humorless and missing the joke behind the anti MSC circle jerk
How to defend as protoss against almost any early game mid game attack have a pylon RTS is about an interaction between the players with different strategies unit combination timings and positioning It s not exactly fun when the solution to basically every type of early aggression Terran can do is is built a single unit MSC Worse still it is literally just a single click to do it No kiting no micro no real decision Defending with the MSC looks almost identical at any level which is indicative of how little depth it actually has
Man I wish these pylons were shooting like overcharged pylons It would fit so well
I tried it s hard to pull off EDIT When you switch the Interceptor weapon they get buggy https gfycat com LegitimateAdoredKarakul https gfycat com AnimatedDelayedDunlin
As a Zerg main this is what it feels like sometimes
that looks somewhat disturbing not for the faint hearted
made me laugh

Legacy of the Mothership core
The one and only thing keeping SC2 back from greatness and carrying Protoss players into the late game
stahp you re gonna accidentally make sc3 P
ahahahahaha
Holy shit I fucking love you man
Love Your GirlFriend
RIP HEADPHONE USERS GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
That is exactly what Terran tears are made from
The sad part is that this is only 50 more retarded than the current version of the mothership core
do one for tankvacs
Bahahahahaha
lol any Korean speakers around to explain what they re actually saying
It s the Dota 2 The International 3 Grand final when Alliance was taking the last win with the million dollar dream coil
According to the audio source linked about Pummel it Pummel it S4 S4 S4 GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG I missed some lines but yeah its not related to SC2 unfortunately lol
here you go
Core ier has arrived
How much for one and I will take one

Well that was unexpectedCan t help but notice this is now useless facts about feardragon instead of with feardragon
Maybe feardragon is a reaper
Fear the reaper
That s not the Illuminati song that s the X Files theme
God dammit I woke up 2 minutes ago and felt like I needed to post one quickly Maybe rushed a little too much
I like it can we keep it this way
Unless you change the posting rules of Reddit it will be staying this way
I think they meant that they d like future useless facts Feardragon posts to keep the new and accidental Useless Facts About Feardragon title
Ah I see I thought they wanted OP someone to change the post title
You are now a reaper congrats
Useless facts about fear dragon 1 He sometimes posts in haste and makes typos
For a second I thought I was on r StarcraftCirclejerk
Terran so underpowered their units can t even get kills
Not shown The kill is actually credited to a Cyclone on the other side of the map
Or that Carbot Tempest from outside the galaxy
Wasn t there a glitch before that teleporting bcs count as resources lost Terran so up they lose units before losing them
I know the past two days haven t been the most uplifting in terms of news but don t forget the game will continue to be there for us and we still have a lot of cool stuff happening in the scene If you want to see more useless facts easiest way to find them is here
People are only creating drama so you will post more useless facts
This fact isn t about feardragon I m disappointed
Does the nexus still have a kill count while the Pylon does not
This is more like a bug fact tho xD
I agree
I don t think so I can t think of any reason to consider this a bug
Because it s clearly not working correctly
He s trolling Check his other response
They re joking about the original double post 1 and 2
Oh I m an asshat ty
This joke is really not getting the praise it deserves
Well it s still useless even if it works right
Maybe if it was a zerg reaper
This is a useful fact for casters Are they actually the 1
Very useful for players too Unit kill count determines which Reaper is going to get sent on a suicide scouting mission
Useless fact about fear dragon he does not own feardragon1 to feardragon63
Very useless as always
literally unplayable
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE
Super easy to fix for Blizz Great find D
We should make a tournament with a mod where those facts are completely emphasized
Well If Grenade was still alive it will have one kill Duh
Reapers don t kill SCV s grenades do
Glorious Absolutely fantastic
Hmm this is interesting for spectators right Or is that just me
Already knew this one they should make it count though
This is more like a bug fact tho xD
I disagree
Eh I would consider this a bug The kill counter should display every kill the unit makes regardless of if it was a spell or ability
The unit is the grenade apparently It s like vultures and spider mines
You believe grenades should have free will and be responsible for their actions hmm
According to the engine the grenade is a unit as much as the reaper is
Repost this if you are a beautiful strong grenade who don t need no reaper
This seems like a bug
You have managed to make this all about you again didn t you
Have you ever done one about how Banelings have a kill counter Seems kinda useless to me
I miss when they used those grenades on buildings p
Under what scenario would this ever be useful misleading advertising
If you wonder how much damage you did worker harassing you might look at your reapers kills If some kills were from the grenade this might cause you to underestimate the amount of damage you did making you believe your opponent is in a better position than he really is
And vice versa If I am jumping around the map while defending a harass I will click on the enemy until to see how many kills it has to judge how much damage it did
Exactly this Polt once was not sure if he killed a worker at the 3 minute mark and he was trying to figure it out for a solid 15 seconds It probably wouldn t have affected anything but hey if even a pro is bugged by it
Read the title again
It says useless not useful The opposite
have you been watching polt s streamThe players are still being announced but the current ones are Cure Snute TLO Hydra Bly Rogue VortiX Ryung Polt Kelazhur Nerchio sOs
sOs and Polt D Definitely tuning into this
Honestly this is my favorite type of line up Good foreigners and good koreans mixed together I ll be watching for sure if I am able
Nice lineup
Invite Marinelord Uthermal plz D
all the invites are finalized I invited both of those players btw but only one was able to make it this time We just need a replacement for Life soon as I find someone we ll announce the matchups
This is one crazy freaking lineup By the way do we know who the casters are yet
So insane you have Rogue sOs Cure and Polt
Awesome great to see Polt and Cure Love me some good Terran action
sickkk cure and o
Did you say sOs Oh boy
dollar sign oh dollar sign oh take me away 3 3
day and time with sOs in it I can t miss it
This is unfair People want to see their local NA stars duke it out not Koreans Then NA can be as good as Koreans in the future This is a well established fact
Yeah we do but we all love watching Korean vs Foreigner attempts too We ll probably get crushed but when it s not every single tournament going on then I m okay with it
JAGW players Yes please 8 foreigners and 8 koreans really looking foward to this
Vortix gonna show everybody who s boss now
Awesome nice to see some good news
I m looking forward to this event The lineup is really sick
This looks fantastic Now if my favourite player would just play in it that would be ByuNd fantastic
Great lineup Looking forward to pretty much every match
Holy s awesome lineup o and Polt if TY plays it will be the most hype tournament
Sick line up can t wait to watch
I love me some sick online invitationals I just hope Rob from production is there He is the best part
Looking forward to it
Yeah that is a crazy lineup Gonna be glued to the PC for this one
Amazing initiative is CatZ gonna be casting with that other dude from recently again sorry other dude I cant remember your name
The last tournament had x5 Kawaiian cocasting https twitter com x5 Kawaiian
look at all the JinAir players what relation might Catz have with them hmmmm Anyway I m definitely cheering for the JinAir boys and Snute and VortiX and Hydra So damn excited
why is it not on tl
No idea I was going to link the post to the TL page but couldn t find one
WANNA KNOW THE BEST PART OF THE WCS CHANGES Now there s a really big difference between Premier and grass roots online tournies Before it was basically the same thing except for prize pools Now this is a great chance to see Foreigners vs Korea THAT S something worth getting excited about this year
Pretty sick lineup indeed Go Snute D
Really nice looking forward to it
Wow this is awesome Cheering for TLO and Snute
I m pretty excited for this Any chance of a rebroadcast at a more NA friendly time
Not 100 certain but since it will be on CatZ s twitch channel you should be able to watch the vod whenever you want to
Looking great awesome Root keeps organising these kind of tournaments
Bold move hosting it on Super Bowl Sunday
I don t know quite a large amount of the audience is probably non american
I was joking because I didn t think there d be a huge overlap in the fan bases Maybe I should have added kappa
I was too Kappa
Is there a TeamLiquid thread about it Reddit Twitter is really terrible for following a tournament and keeping on updated information I want to be hyped but I don t know anything about it
My family will be watching the superbowl but I ll be tuned into this bad boy WOOOOO Starcraft I love you
Vamos Juan VortiX la armada espa ola Excited to see this after Catz rant More ROOT things please
Calling it now Polt or Rogue are gonna win No matter how hard we ban them from our tournaments Koreans are still better
Which is precisely why they re bannedthis is the worst SC news I ve ever read
I loved him so much As much as a grown man can love a 17 year old Asian boy But now he has gone and broke my heart Edit Okay he s only been accused Innocent until proven guilty But still it s so damn sad to read
It s believed they have enough evidence to prosecute him for it that s why this next step has been taken As sad as it makes me the chances he is innocent are getting smaller
Yeah they don t tend to go after athletes or sport icons if there aren t some pretty solid evidence
There are several ways to love a 17 year old Asian boy
All of them shamefully

There s a 98 conviction rate Unless he miraculously falls into the 2 he s guilty
So you re saying there s a chance
Yeh it s pretty sad T T
Look at it from the bright side now the Korean scene has more room for new talent Everything will be fine s
Downsizing is healthy boys
D O W N S I Z E B O Y S
Yeah I really hope it is all false
SK news
So Life in prison
most likely a life ban from the scene and probably anything else in korea he is basically fucked in korea shit like this follows you forever
Not necessarily we need to wait and see the facts how he s prosecuted and if he s convicted Dragon had a match fixing scandal and was eventually found to be innocent now he streams with a decent following I think Life could still be an SC2 pro if he s found to be innocent but that s a big and optimistic if
I thought it was for maphacking
The initial controversy with Dragon was over stream cheating not maphacking He openly admitted and apologized for listening to a live stream of the match against TheStC Later in an unrelated thing he was accused of match fixing vehemently denied it and was eventually cleared of all charges but not before he took some pretty bad flak for it
They have a 98 conviction rate He s utterly screwed
That s Japan
see page 258 it s high but it s roughly 70 just eyeballing the ratio it s nowhere NEAR 90 https books google com books id pLbnCAAAQBAJ pg PA259 lpg PA259 dq korean conviction rate source bl ots CezHUcA4Id sig 9OCGtB75ToWDbStw0t15rGnBt68 hl en sa X ved 0ahUKEwiu pe6qdXKAhVGeSYKHbsxDKoQ6AEIJzAB v onepage q korean 20conviction 20rate f false
But after that scandal Dragon hasn t been able to participate in any tourneys that I can remember Also the whole fiasco with Slayers He derived his income instead from streaming which is fine and used his notoriety to his advantage so to speak
Essentially his normal life in Korea is over Best move if he gets convicted or whatever you call it for him will probably to live elsewhere
The long game to avoid military service It s all clear to me now
I come from the small tribe of r osugame and its both interesting and depressing to see that other games are this affected by conscription
Savior didn t leave his house for years after the incident
How familiar are you with korean culture Their entire society condemns you the second you get convicted for this His future employers are gonna see thos etc
people should see the things that happen in kpop peoples lives get ruined over silly shit that they didn t even do
For those out of the know he s how ridiculous KPop gets Female pop stars frequently have clauses in their contracts stating that they can t date anyone Ever The idea is that fans who desire to be with singers will feel like the celebrity is attainable very deliberate use of the word attainable here so long as they re single Female performers have lost rights to their creative work and have lost contracts over paparazzi catching them on dinner dates And these women rarely if ever receive another contract from any entertainment company Those women are blacklisted throughout the industry for going on a dinner date South Korea takes celebrity culture way too seriously

Great write up you found Thanks for sharing
Sure thing I had just happened to read this a few days ago I was amazed that someone would feel the need to shave their head in contrition for spending the night at their boyfriend s house
Hell a guy s live was ruined for saying that he went to Stanford and the crazy thing is that he did actually do so
You re referring to tablo of epik high He suffered a stupid amount of stress and hardship after the whole fiasco but he is pretty much over it now His albums are stellar and the group is doing better than ever
Also it was proven he actually went
Still he was guilty even after proven innocent
Sounds like a Reddit conviction
Jesus just read the Wiki article about the incident The guy flew to Stanford shot a documentary showing university officials printing the correct documents on camera then was subject to a police investigation that independently confirmed the information And still people didn t believe it Truly insane
Its like how conservatives kept asking for obamas long form birth certificate then they wanted a certificate of life birth Then after that some still dont believe it
Rip Tablo
People didnt want to believe he was so academically successful and intelligent Then look at the IU pedophile bullshit
Yeah its insane how fucked up people can become just because of rumours Lifes status is basically destroyed even if he was innocent
You overestimate it He ll never have a possibility to work in e sport again but Starcraft isn t important enough to really prevent him from getting a job ever again The other problem is he ll have to go to school again
Starcraft maybe is not important enough but think about this He is getting charged for being a part of a match fixing scheme Starcraft does not matter at all in this case If he is proven guilty in a court then it doesn t matter that he did matchfixing in a game like starcraft what matters is that he actually was involved in the matchfixing in the first place I have a friend who did stupid shit when he was younger and now his criminal record is always following him when he applies for work He is a blue collar worker and even that job he got thanks to his mother who is also working in that firm I can add that this is Sweden Now think about South Korea where crimes are actually taken with more seriousness than in Sweden If he is lucky he can manage to find a job and live a normal life
I understand the point My sister s boyfriend was part of a jewelry shop robbery he parked the car a few streets away his cousin told him he just had a small course to make that he was right back The guy didn t know about any robbery and spent one year in prison Although he was freed because it was clear his cousin was the bad guy he has served a sentence although small He followed a program with the prison with the goal to get back to work had a small job in a big State company and after a few years went job hunting again So I had thought that you could live with a judiciary past but I guess this isn t the case everywhere
The people who can really speak as to whether this stuff marks you for life or not are the people who ve been through this What does Savior do today Did he recover from his situation If he says yes well then But if he talks about all these opportunities that he knows full well he s excluded from even after all these years well that s the kind of stuff that you won t walk away from
Best edit I ve seen in years
I see what you did there
I wonder how much money it took to buy Life off I mean the guy made 460 000 in four years of work his match fixing price must be something like 10K if BboongBboong and YoDa were getting 4 6K for their thrown matches
yep 460000 prize money plus the salary if confirmed there must be a lot of money involved let s hope least people possible
A professor one time told me he was approached by a parent after class to buy a grade The dad whipped out his check book and the prof said two million the dad said what and the prof said if this gets out it not only ruins my job here it ruins my career as an educator and it ruins my career as an academic If this gets out it invalidates my entire adult life s effort You want me to gamble that then you better be able to comfortably take care of me into retirement That s what s at stake This kid didn t lose money made leading up the kid lost all the money that would have been available after this including any tangential work related to this Hope the kid took enough to not worry
Assuming he doesnt have repay the money
Your professor is a boss
Well I think it depends on potential payoff for the ones who were going to bet that he would lose So if it s 10 to 1 maybe they pay him more
It s kind of interesting that these things are so rampant Are these guys just so good that if there was no match fixing that all tournaments would be boring stomps Makes me wonder if there s not some greater pressure that goes beyond money If a huge organization is like FIFA can be rife with corruption Maybe the gaming leagues and their sponsors are somewhat involved I wonder if we ll ever know how deep the rabbit hole goes or maybe it s just a bunch of silly kids making poor decisions All I know is that stuff like this is polluting so many e sports leagues Cyclists doping game players on adderall corrupt leagues and game fixing players What s real in modern e sports anymore
Life found a way alright
Too soon Kappa
Man life was the iconic player of the HOTS era This is just sad to see
Even late WoL going head to head agains Mvp and winning
Now I m super sour about Life Denying Mvp his G5L fair and square only to throw it all away by matchfixing years later
Looks like Life was the true sAviOr of sc2 indeed
Why did it have to be a zerg player
he was corrupted by the Overmind
It s always the Zerg players sAviOr Ogogo Luxury
Spreads like tumors
Not like this

Best FPL anti pick ever
Is it possible that ninjas kidnapped his family and forced him to do it
Usually I really enjoy sc2 drama but not this time Please dont be true
To be honest the authorities really need to bust this case wide open and see just how deep the rabbit hole goes I m pretty sure matchfixing in Korea is a wide sweeping issue and that KeSPA are very reluctant to investigate it further especially if we ve seen a number of suspicious series from top tier pros and have some very big names in the scene indicted on charges
He s only 19 and has essentially fucked up his future in Korea or anywhere else for that matter forever
Assuming he s found guilty that is
Even if he s found innocent people will talk about it and he may find himself in KeSpa jail
Even if you proved yourself as innocence you are always going to get discriminated This is particularly the case in Asia
plus 19 is an age of majority in Korea that timing
I don t know how that works in Korea but it s a principle of law that you are tried under the law at the time of the crime occuring ie if you were less than 18 when a crime happened you ll be charged as a minor even if you re 20 when caught If the law changed and became harsher you ll be tried under a softer law too
that would make sense
So if Life does get banned does CJ Bunny automatically get into Code S
Bunny is the only person on the planet praying that life is found guilty xD
I guess even Bunny would hope for Life to not be guilty this would be a huge blow for Korean pros especially
Haha he ll get wrecked by TY again
Build a wall to keep the cheating Koreans out of WCS and make SC2 great again
I guess we have some idea of the names Wolf was hearing during the Prime case now
I m absolutely shattered Life has a legitimate claim as the best SC2 player ever His multiple championships his unending skill at playing series and his opponents We just lost our Lebron James to illegal gambling
Kinda funny because Michael Jordan was involved in a lot of gambling during his career too and would often lose big on bets There s a theory out there that his break to play baseball at the peak of his career was actually a secret deal with the commissioner of the nba so they wouldn t have to publicly suspend or ban him for gambling the way he did
R I P Life and Korean SC2
The scene doesn t rely on one individual The scene will move on and that s all there is to it
The scene will move on but this may affect not only viewership but sponsorship as well which would be a big deal The extent of the damage is tough to guess though
I know if i was an investor this would be a red light for me if he s found guilty it s downright despicable he had the potential to be the best some might say he was no excuse for this shit
Ehh seeing your favorite player get banned for life is going to have a major impact on a lot of viewers including me
he was the only player that got me interested in the game since WOL the only reason I would watch the streams when I had to be sleeping This is really sad If he stops playing I don t think I ll watch sc2 that much
Say that to NA CSGO
NA CSGO was dead in the water anyway
This seems hard to believe Why would someone like Life accept money to fix a match when he s already so successful Why would he need it THIS SUCKS
Young and stupid He s only 19 years old 19 year old me with 400k made would be doing a lot of stupid things
and the fixed matches were done when he was 18 yo
wtf i thought he was like youngest sc2 player in the scene like 14 15 yo Maybe he was last I checked Time flies
Maybe he was the one to pay DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
Threatened
Noob here what is match fixing
All the banned players chould have show matches sAviOr FTW
Whatever hes still the best zerg This new genuinely makes me sad but match fixer or not I d watch any game he played in One thing that worries me about esports scenes in countries with big organised crime is that if big money was riding on these results the chances are big criminals may be involved in fixing them Like do we expect 17 year old korean kids to stare down some hardcore gangsters when professional boxers can t
According to Korean news sites there was 9 people in total arrested Probably managers and directors that pushed Life to do it Apparently some gang activity had to do with it as some Korean sites are reporting The big thing here is I doubt it was isolated to just Life He was at the top of the starcraft professional scene I m sure others were involved I remember an Innovation vs EDIT SOULKEY finals where Inno went up 3 0 then Soulkey took 4 games with roach all ins while Inno played uncharacteristically poor and never made one tank to hold it This is crazy all this time wasted watching tourneys that likely were majorily fixed
I realize these things makes you question life itself But dont fall in a conspiracy syndrome
There have been some Innovation games in the past with suspicious betting patterns but I hope it s not a case where both were involved I assume multiple top level players fixing with their organisations supporting it would be pretty close to a lethal blow for the Korean scene
jesus guys inno plays a very mechanical style and he doesn t respond well to stuff throwing him off he s an insanely good player mechanically and so people do weird stuff to mindgame him and mess with his head that s the way you beat innovation these speculations are ridiculous a machine like player in a macro game getting thrown off with weird strats under insane pressure MATCH FIXING OMG
exactly its also ridiculous because there is literally zero proof about a fix it was a fucking GSL FINALS and OP didnt even remember that it was soulkey and not life which shows the little research he has actually done on this and instead just spits around blind accusations
Well yeah I see no reason to look at that final since it wasn t even Life playing in it Just saying there was at least one match involving Inno losing in a somewhat weird manner that got pulled from Pinnacle because of the betting patterns Game itself was nowhere near as suspicious the MarineKing game that he s apparently been cleared of throwing intentionally though
That was Inno vs Soulkey
Seriously He s a suspect he has by no means found guilty yet He allegedly received money for matchfixing until he s found guilty you should all keep your cool and just wait it out Innocent until proven guilty I find it disappointing to see how quickly you guys are jumping the media bandwagon and how fast you do a full 180 on your opinion on someone who is just a suspect tt This is how someone s career and name gets ruined after having been a suspect but proven innocent Plenty of stories around Charges get dropped but the person s name is ruined forever Also Life made almost 500k during his career so financially likely would not have been a motivator IF he already matchfixed he or his close relatives possibly got threatened by dangerous people who don t like being fucked with
I cant imagine they would arrest him with no evidence He might not be guilty but you cant say its looking good
https books google com books id uM0eXbCjnWsC lpg PA220 dq south 20korean 20court 20conviction 20rate pg PA220 v onepage q south 20korean 20court 20conviction 20rate f false South Korean courts have a 99 conviction rate The 1 that get off are usually in very odd or unusual cases or where the prosecutors drop the ball Whether or not he s factually innocent if they bring charges he will be convicted Period Call it a corrupt court system that doesn t really believe in innocent until proven guilty or call it a prosecutorial culture that doesn t bring charges unless it knows with complete certainty that it can get a conviction We could have a long debate about the state of Korean courts and their issues or strengths It s also unclear what s going on and whether he s actually been charged Edit He has been charged But one thing is very clear if they do indict him he s going to be found guilty
if he s a suspect and was arrested it means they have evidence to support the case as much as i don t want it to be true it seems the odds are against him and even if he was pressured to matchfix from some outside source he d still be permabanned by kespa
I get and respect your point but it s not looking like people apart from the usual retards are throwing shit at anybody there is just sadness in Life s and SC fans because this could be a catastrophe for the entire scene and because it s hard to imagine that a teenager would get this kind of charge without some kind of legit evidence plus believe me if Life is found innocent his reputation won t be ruined at all people are gonna be SO RELIEVED he would be loved even more than he was before
No Reputations take way longer to fix
Not for a small community like Starcraft
You underestimate humans
He was charged according to this tweet You don t arrest someone and charge them if you don t have evidence
He s been arrested There is a 90 something percent conviction rate for this kind of thing and due to how the system works they don t arrest someone unless there s enough to likely convict them They don t arrest suspects Nobody arrests suspects You arrest someone you re going to bring to trial There s a reason why the arrest is the last part of a police drama because that s the guy going to trial Yes he s not been convicted but it s safe to say he will be
They might for a lot of crimes but match fixing or fraud almost never see arrest before a significant case is built up
I completely agree and I hope in hell he is found innocent
Keep in mind the police wouldn t just arrest someone for no reason They have enough evidence against him to arrest and charge him Otherwise they wouldn t risk arresting him and potentially having to let him go I find it highly doubtful the police would arrest someone on a serious charge just because Usually the police investigates first then arrest as necessary
This hurts the game s legitimacy If one of the best players in the world is matchfixing that really hurts SC2 chances of becoming popular
The glory days of SC2 are over dude
2011 peak SC2 RIP
He should move to America and continue to play We let famous people get away with stuff all of the time
one thing s for certain KeSPA is not having huge success in preventing this kind of stuff to happen when sAviOr case happened they were very vocal that despite the damage done a zero tolerance policy was all they needed to prevent corruption from happening guess they were very wrong they should have worked in depth to eradicate bad habits and menaces at the source If it comes out a top SC pro can be easily blackmailed addicted to gambling and stuff it would mean the eSports organizations did not do enough to protect professional scene from these threats I wuould expect atleast some KeSPA representative to admit some kind of responsability for that
If Life match fixed pretty much says everything about the state of SC2 in Korea
How so
if even someone perceived as doing very well winning a lot of things feels like he isnt making enough money to justify it then theres something really wrong i mean its possible life is secretly a sociopath and just doing whatever because why the fuck not but assuming hes a normal person he has to have decent motivation to do something bad
Being well paid or paid at all isn t a panacea for match fixing in SC2 or any other sport traditional or otherwise Plenty of high profile match fixing tampering scandals in sports have involved people that were well compensated by most reasonable standards Sure more money may remove the motivation for some people but there s always others Sometimes it s that they feel like they should be making more sometimes they have a gambling habit sometimes they just spent all the money People look at Life and ask why he made so much money No one knows the reality of his financial situation Maybe he spent it all Maybe his parents took it all from him Maybe he got scammed out of it Point is the motivation for match fixing is not as simple as he isn t getting paid enough
If the allegations are true it has nothing to do with him not making enough money to justify it Life made more money than every single Foreigner in sc2 He earned 473 000 in prizemoney plus salary We don t know what he has done with that money but if he needed to matchfix out of financial pressures it s because of his own mismanagement not cause of the Korean scene
except we now know looking back that many of the early top winners gave their winnings to their teams to keep them afloat giving a rosier impression of the korean scene than was real and even then noone thought it was great sure its possible he somehow lost his winnings but its not the only reason why he might do this
match fixing happens in literally every sport the difference is people in esport are way too young and stupid and get caught
Greed is common habit of humans You dont have to be a socipoath or need to be rich or poor or just want a little more
Life made almost 500k dollars by the age of 19 You dont see MC being arrested Fuck it
It says more about the player it has little to do with money and more to do with character
his team managers are likely involved Just like Gerrard in Prime Its very unlikely to be a 1 man thing
Nope since it happens in every sport It s like the recent scandal in tennis and tennis is still a popular sport as far as I know What you say is totally unfounded and the fact that you are getting upvoted is kind of depressing The only thing it shows is the state of esport and match fixing in Korea And I don t think any game is spared
Does anyone have any matches that seem fishy or that could be potential evidence anecdotally I mean I can t think of too many matches off the top of my head where Life was beaten or lost in weird ways Maybe he s just that good In a bad way
The one some are pointing to was Life v Solar on Merry Go Round from 2014 Proleague don t know if it is though
The only thing that I can think of that would be remotely suspicious is Life vs Taeja at IEM where he accidentally detonated all his banelings twice It was the 100 000 take all and maybe he thought he wouldn t win the whole thing EDIT Maybe I m thinking of the wrong tournament but point is Life detonating all his banelings multiple times in the series is suspicious
Was hoping Life would be the only player to win the Triple Crown GSL 1 in WoL 1 in HotS 1 in LotV Soo sad now effectively nobody can get this achievement
I m seriously asking here but why would this warrant an arrest
Why would fraud warrant an arrest
idk why but I feel like for some reason Life s dad is involved Never liked that dude His son beat MVP to become GSL champion at 15 and he couldn t even smile
With the arrest of Life zerg is no longer OP
If it s true then I don t get it He earned so much money from last 3 years that almost no SC2 pro did and only small percentage of adults can earn that much what reason can make you fix a match after having earned that much
Even Savior was at the top of the world when be was match fixing
Criminal gang pressuring your family or your life unless you throw a match
Mafia is everywhere Can I interest you in an anti mafia insurance
They say a man never really knows himself until his freedom s been taken away I wonder how well does he knows himself
I remember when this happened in BW and thinking At least it won t happen again Really difficult to watch a competition when you have good reason to think it s no longer an actual competition May as well watch pro wrestling or something
He had all the tools He had many fans behind his back He has won it all and still doing this If he is guilty man fucking greedy piece of shit
If he is guilty it may not have been because of greed maybe it was take this cash to match fix or your family member is going to have an accident With the people that organise this kind of stuff who knows
So what s the law in Korea Jail or fines They will probably not punish him too harshly but dat criminal record though Hard to get jobs now
What confuses me by far the most is that life already made so much cash in winnings Why would he get into match fixing Maybe this entire thing is much bigger than we realize and there is a lot of people behind it that force players into match fixing idk by threatening or w e Ofc that doesnt make it right and im not trying to defend anyone here but I can just see no logical explanation for why a teenager that already makes hundreds of thousands of in earnings would risk his entire life just to make a couple bucks more Even if that was some serious cash I just dont see it being as simple as that edit now that I come to think about it with all the retirements lately in the KR scene maybe this is all related Maybe there is some Players retiring because they feel its the only way out of this who knows
Fuck this
Yay we re a real sport now
I feel ill
eSports isn t a real sport until it has the corruption of field sports
Maybe he got scammed out of financial motivation in life s case
Wow I don t really follow sc2 any more but I still remember how exciting Life was to watch play and how fucking amazing he was truly one of the best zergs of all time in sc2 arguably the best This would be crushing if it s true
I hardly follow Sc2 anymore and this is crushing news
If Life ended up match fixing It must ve been far higher than what he would normally make I guess there s no money in SC2 like there was in BW So much match fixing potentially even from the tournament winners
I m a bot bleep bloop Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit r games Ten time premier Starcraft 2 tournament champion Life arrested for match fixing x post r starcraft If you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and don t vote in the other threads Info Contact
So what forced him into accepting this Was the money just that good Or is eSports really that bad that one of the most prominent korean SC2 players felt the need to take money for a fixed match
Unfortunately the crowd mentality in Korea is very much guilty until proven innocent maybe Many Korean celebrities accused of misdeeds have had their reputations ruined forever even after they were found totally innocent One example off the top of my head was the controversy over Tablo graduating from Stanfordcoda cloud kingdom day break neo Planet s yeonsu ohana terraform loved them all so much
Rip in peace Cloud Kingdom your sharks will fly forever
Ohana means family
Ohana is what made me hate Protoss
Do you even Yeonsu
Some people play Yeonsu some watch Avilo some get DT rushed on their first game For me it was Ohana
I love that you mention neo planet S It wasnt in the map pool for long and didnt have a huge impact like king sejong or ohana but it was definitely one of my favorite maps This was back in the SH era and it was one of the few maps that was both difficult to split in half and didnt have 1 central pathway to all 4 5 bases on the map That made for some fun games and made SH a lot less obnoxious
It is one of my favorite maps of all time Now that I think of it maybe part of it was the snow All the terrain is similar now
What all those maps have in common that the current maps in the pool don t have is they re all created by users while the current map pool is entirely done by Blizzard
don t forget Frost
I can never read Neo Planet S normally in my head it s being read by the smash bros announcer NEO PLANET S
I really miss King Sejong
Man I never liked daybreak The rest of them where great indeed
Overgrowth was pretty unique tho offensive gold spinerush lingflood all in was my favorite zvp build there
That s a good point maybe it s because it seems like Blizzard is equating unique with gimmicky when it comes to new maps that I m remembering it as standard
I loved so much that map It was one of the most balanced we ve ever seen No blink abuse possible not too wide open to drops nat not to wide open ez wall
I really like that you could siege the natural really well made map
I was terrified to take a third as protoss Lings would delay the expo two or three times Early mines were pretty good too
It was unique in a good way Not the current bs we have
it still had that X Factor I want more maps like Overgrowth but I don t think Overgrowth was necessarily every other map Not to say that standard maps aren t good or fun and if that s what most people want then it is definitely something that should be brought up and discussion should be encouraged as it is here Personally I like unique maps because they produce unique games as a player I enjoy this because my favorite thing about the game is the strategy bit Blizzard might think along the same lines but ultimately we should always try to find a middle ground that pleases most of our audience and players without alienating the rest if we can help it there are 7 maps available at a time so good middle grounds in something like a map pool shouldn t be too difficult to reach
My problem with a lot of unique maps is the uniqueness is generally only consistency exploitable by only one side of a matchup That builds in a handicap of sorts for one side of a game and that makes games on those maps less interesting to be The original ramp on Daedalus Point was unique but watching protoss play with a massive inherent disadvantage vs zerg was not fun or interesting gameplay
Cloud Kingdom
Do you know about the secret cannon spot
Christ that keyboard
Antigua shipyard I loved that map so much to me it was some kind of abandoned trading post in firefly Current maps have no character like that
Me too not just because it actually looks like something out of Firefly People complained about how hard it was to get a 4th but I was just a noob Plat Protoss and I could get that 3rd so easy then just A move my Blink Stalker Colossus deathball across the map Good times
Habitation Station King Sejong Station Frost damn I m even Jonesing for Expedition Lost that s how bad things have gotten
Same here but for Coda and Frost
Same here but for Akilon Wastes and Cloud Kingdom
Same here but King Sejong Station
KSS one of if not the best 2 player map in SC2 history Honourable mention for habitation station
If we had to go full League and only play one map forever it would be King Sejong Station
I miss all the good games on Frost Symbol vs InnoVation or Heart vs XiGua was one of my favorites
check out Maru VS Dear on Frost oh baby Oh and nobody cares but my most missed maps are 1 KSS 2 Overgrowth 3 YEONSU BABY
Oh I forgot about that Dear s my favorite players and any series that involve him and Maru back in 2013 is so good I just wish we get some good standard macro maps again
Belshire anyone just me ok
I miss many standard maps but overgrowth had to die It had unnaturally long life which continued in Korean cups even after it was removed from ladder
Because it was such a good map along with KSS
Whats the problem With unique maps you can use other builds than on standart maps Whats the point of 7 same maps So you only have to study 1 build With different maps you can have a different build for every map
That s true but then we have maps like Prion Terraces and it s hard to see if units are imbalanced or the map is And then if you want to balance something around one two maps it might break the balance on different maps If you understand what I mean
Yes i understand that but if thats the main point then there should be only 1 map around which the game is balanced and every other map that differs would be at least a little bit unbalanced Maybe there shouldnt be any map on which one race is favored but there should be more different unique balanced maps in which other builds are used to Else there is no point in having more than 1 where every game looks the same Imagine there would be a map with no ground connection and only air for example That would be pretty sick and new Ofc it should be balanced for all races
Which is really really hard to do
I think OP s use of Overgrowth illustrates the point most people are trying to make perfectly Overgrowth allowed players to engage in a massive breadth of play with the forward gold offering all kinds of unique play styles while still giving players that preferred standard maps what they liked A truly great map is one where a game can play out standard or straight up bizarre based on how the players choose to play not how the map shoe horns them into playing The problem with prion terraces Ulrena and Central Protocal isn t that they are unique its that they are just straight up bad Instead of trying to patch fixes etc we need to move on and find our next Overgrowth
Variation is ok but only with in a certain degree The maps we have now are too varied
Unique maps force you to use certain builds on them Standard maps don t limit you as much On standard maps some people are lazy and don t vary their builds but the maps do not tie you to doing only one build they merely make it possible to play that way Nonstandard maps like Prion force you to play very specific builds in specific matchups and are ultimately more limiting
omg I miss that map so much
Catalena coda take me back
Overgrowth never forget RIP
Had such a high win percentage on that map FeelsBadMan
I think Overwatch was the best map of SC2 so far I really can t think of another that could compete
I miss Antiga and Daybreak T T
Overgrowth was an amazing map People did get sick of it because it stuck around for so long but it was so balanced If they ever do another dream pool I hope we see it again
I want Antiga Shipyard back c
Blizz wants UNIQUE maps e g Maps with all GOLD bases Main Base with Huge OPEN RAMP MAin with BACK ROCKS ON 3 SIDES
Why think fondly of the most boring and over exposed map of all time Keep the game fresh and keep maps diverse to force different strategies and experiences
Holy fuck yes
one of the best maps of all time for sure I really hope Blizzard realizes that maps can be unique without having some gimmick i e gold 3rd base
FUCK YES I COMPLETELY AGREE I MISS OVERGROWTH Edit ALL THESE MAPS SUCK ASS
I too loved OG but remember how much people were ranting at it for being too old too standard and shit The community killed itI feel like there really should be a huge discussion about the korean scene as a whole at this point You have to remember that these kids join esport teams before they are adults probably even neglecting any education for the most part They live in the team house training countless hours and don t even get a decent salary unless you are the superstar I am not surprised that such an environment would create matchfixing not saying that ONLY in these circumstances matchfixing is a problem but it certainly helps Obviously in Life s case this doesn t fit the picture but if we believe other statements Rekrul some foreign progamers there is a lot more shady stuff going on beyond the surface Nobody ever talks about the questionable enviroment though i feel that should change Maybe i misrepresent the whole thing with this post if i do so pls correct me but that s what i feel atm
This probably has a whole hell of a lot more to do with Korean society in general than it does with just the Starcraft 2 scene The fact that illegal gambling rings can operate so boldly says a lot Life could lose his entire career loads of his earnings and will probably have a tough future ahead of him Where is the talk about the brokers and the gangsters facilitating this to happen so frequently and so blatantly Children are frequently offered thousands of dollars by adults and the children who accept lose everything As a side note life is only 19 years old Did you understand what 500k meant when you were that age Also he s still living in a team house in less than ideal conditions for a normal life so it s not like he s living the life of someone earning 100k year That money must be so abstract to him if he even still has it
I don t know about Korean culture specifically but in most Asian cultures it s expected common that you pay back your parents in one way or another Depending on how much you earn it s pretty much a given that you pay some sort of allowance to them until you re married I d be surprised if most progamers didn t pass along a large portion of their earnings winnings to their parents I don t think Life kept the 500K for himself
It s a given Look at MC MVP and all the big name players What do they do with all that money Goes straight to their parents or at least a significant chunk of it Here in America yeah it s a lot more about me me me mo money mo money mo money But in Korea the respect towards your elders is deeply ingrained The culture is enormously different and something I dare say many Americans wouldn t really understand
Illegal stuff happens all over the world man You can t blame korea for having a illegal gambling scene It s entirely Life s fault that he decided he wants to be a part of it
So your point is that they shouldn t bother trying to improve conditions or go after the illegal gambling rings I assume this just means gangsters because it s entirely up to 19 year old life to push away their demands for his entire career Great
I m not saying they shouldn t fight against illegal gambling rings Just that it s 100 Life s fault and not theirs Let s take the war on drugs as an example Gouverments are fighting them but it s just not as easy as you make it seem And yeah it s the fault of a 19 year old if he decides to take drugs and not the dealers gouverments edit Actually players like Life are the ones that create the illegal matchfixing scene Not the other way around And it s not because progamers have a a hard life Life is a superstar and probaly made more money than any other 19 year old It was pure greed that lead Life into the illegal scene
You don t have any insights in the case How can you get to such conclusions We know nothing about the case we don t know If they preasured him into doing the match fixing At this point we are in no position to put all the blame on someone the whole thing too complex to be put down this easy I don t know anything about the gangs u Throwawayaccount 047 is writing about And I don t think that the Korean administration is NOT fighting them
Illegal gambling is just one of those things which seems to come hand in hand with organised crime It is an assumption but one based on examples from many other countries and of course wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki Crime in South Korea
You don t understand u throwawayaccount 047 s point It s hard to put all the blame on someone who probably doesn t really understand how much 400k really is because he lived all his young adult life in a gaming house and have not known what living alone paying for your stuff is like It s also the State s concern that its population doesn t turn into criminals or in this case illegal gamblers or match fixing athletes It s not their responsability if it happens but it becomes theirs too when they let it happen
yea let s blame the fucking kid because he obviously thought yay i wanna be a part of this Teenagers being bet on winning and losing at an international game with thousands of dollars at stake that does not fucking happen everywhere and obviously in Korea it is attracting the attention of criminal groups who have professionals that know how to fucking convince a kid As if this is the hardest thing they had to do
If he did engage in match fixing you really have no idea what the stakes and rewards were He very well could have been more than happy to accept deals depending on how much money was involved and his disposition towards the game You don t know him neither do I and neither of us understand the situation The world isn t as ethically and emotionally simplistic as your favorite anime Life the person is probably more complex than its 1 dimensional protagonist Nineteen is young but it s old enough to understand risk and consequence
I honestly disagree I think we re probably both American and grew up with totally different environmental and societal pressures on us The choice was less his than it would have been ours had it been offered to us in America at that age
I m sure when the full details come out we ll hear about the others involved Remember the whole Prime thing In the full report it mentioned the people involved that weren t from the sc2 scene and they got punished pretty hard I think The community will obviously focus on the sc2 players involved but I don t think it s correct to say that people aren t talking about the gangsters that are involved
where did that large number even come from
the air i dont even know how anyone knows the reason for his arrest why would the police release that to the public
what needs to change is the atittude of programers that they need go in to a team house and should dedicate the entirity of their life to starcraft 2 starcraft 2 can be so depressing to watch when you think about the horrible life prospects of the players especially when they lose a match
we actually can t tell how the match fixing is done how s the approach on the players what pressure they receive what promises are told I don t know man for guys like Yoda and BB I kinda understand easy money easy way but Life
My point is that the korean scene seems kinda shady even without matchfixing if you think about it Kids join proteams and don t even get a decent salary for it I mean you could argue that they get exploited In Life s case this is less of a motivation because he is a big superstar in the context of sc2 but overall i can definitely see WHY some of these guys feel the need to earn some extra money The whole scene doesn t feel stable and respectable when you look at it this way As i said i am sorry if i misrepresent the environment somebody with more knowledge someone closer to it can definitely correct me
We can even look into other countries in that region when it comes to practise environments This things is Not a esport thing I would more say its more of a Hierarchy where young minds become products of persons with interests extreme example but point made
Well i am not saying this is exclusive to korean esport but i hardly see anyone discussing it Which is wrong imo
What would you want to achieve with talking about it Just curious
Hashtag activism lets talk about something over which we have no control or impact so we feel better about ourselves
I simply think it s always better to discuss problems instead of sweeping it under the mat It probably won t change anything though i get that
Well said Chobra StarCraft is a wonderful lovely thing and it s disappointing to see all the bad news and negative vibes lately
It is a lovely game But for those who wish to view it as a career it is indubitable that this news will weigh heavily on whatever few that is
It is both my career and Chobra s so I think that sense may be a little overblown
You are already in it an invested party For you to fight on would be a consequence of your commitments and unyielding stance For a prospective amateur or less unwavering enthusiast the situation is bound to differ
Maybe The news is unfortunate but even in a worst case scenario Starcraft will survive this pretty easily imo
We have statements like this but we are still not sure if Life is really guilty or not Am I right
He s been brought in by the official police It s very very likely he ll be convicted
esports police Constable Artosis
Kespa has investigated match fixing before by themselves this is far more serious
It s crazy that criticism would have almost 2 different meanings that would both apply here I like the second one better you like the first one better that s fine crit i cism krid siz m noun 1 the expression of disapproval of someone or something based on perceived faults or mistakes he received a lot of criticism synonyms censure condemnation denunciation disapproval disparagement opprobrium fault finding attack broadside stricture recrimination More 2 the analysis and judgment of the merits and faults of a literary or artistic work alternative methods of criticism supported by well developed literary theories synonyms evaluation assessment appraisal analysis judgment More
I hope so he s my favorite player and has been for years
Same here hope he comes out clean however unlikely it may be starting to seem
There isnt a big reason for that hope At the moment he is at the same spot as 4B and Yoda They havent been at a curt when we all called them matchfixers but a prosecutor had enough evidence to bring it to court and KESPA called them out 98 of the prosecutors files are won in front of courts Life is in prison the evidence must be really solid or else you dont get arrested and treated like that in Korea There is a reason why statements like this are brought But just like Yoda and 4B the evidence is so pressuring that he sits in prison and looks very grim It is the right moment for such statements even they wount help in the decline
It s B4 not 4B
Doesn t matter Kespa have a 0 tolerance policy on this The moment you are arrested you can t participate any Kespa sanctioned event
Even tho I know that he s right I still feel horrible about this sAviOr used to be one of my favorite players back then and this strikes an awfully familiar note Right now I just want to cry Life heh will go on but not right now
I m glad chobra wrote this I certainly needed to read it I m glad he s still active in the scene
go play some sc2 sc2 community nah too stressful i just watch
It s not like he died lol
He may as well have
ma bonjwa is dead to me
Guys do we have Brendan Dassey in custody Can we pin this one on him too Just this once
I m not caught by shock and awe about this news and it s not cause I always suspected Life It s just simply that it can happen to anyone How the fuck can it happen to anyone To get caught Or to be a match fixer
Both Match fixing exists in esports way more than we actually know Very few get caught though
My point was that it can t happen to anyone And it s absurd to say it can It besides the point how much get caught because if you don t accept the bribe you will not be in a position to get caught And to absolve Life with a saying it can happen to anyone is that real life pun intended
if you don t accept the bribe you will not be in a position to get caught Maybe the people offering the bribe dont take no for an answer if you know what I mean They are hardly playing by the law kind of guys in the first place
If you think that this is a take no for an answer situation you are living in a ferry tale moooooseknuckle i wasn t referring to his gilt or innocence but the comment that it could happen to anyone that i found funny and not true
The point isn t to absolve him If he s innocent he ll be back If he s guilty then he s gone and will be penalized accordingly There s no need to dwell on him just move on
There have been various match fixing incidents in different games SC2 is hard to matchfix on because you have to do it for cash in other more popular games kappa you can bet skins and various items therefore getting a quick reward You can do it in many ways without ever getting caught One very popular incident that happened was the IbuyPower controversy in CS GO Google it It s just one of the many that have happened and yet very little have been found because it s incredibly easy to cover your tracks when you re match fixing The only reason that incident went public is because an angry ex gf of a player spilled the beans on twitter about it all If it was not for her we would ve never known
I m sure when the full details come out we ll hear about the korean scene as a whole at this point
Good read Gonna hit that ladder New Season hype
Yeah it s kind of retarded how some people say it shows the state of the scene I mean there is this kind of scandal everywhere in every large sport or esport It s sad but it happens The issue is that this kind of situation seem to happen more often in Korea
I wish he had something interesting to say
Watch a movie Build a snowman Go to the beach
right on Chobra
It s kind of brilliant actually Life always wins except when he deliberately loses
Brood war was fun to play and watch Starcraft 2 is absolute shit
he always suspected Life uhh
This reads like he always suspected Life but that s not the reason he isn t caught in shock and awe I am no native speaker though so maybe i am wrong Either way he surely didn t mean it that way

Ya the TB hat makes no sense I mean I love the guy but there was never much of a meme revolving around his hat Let alone a meme which would top the tosis pylon
I hear people say artosis pylon very regularly Never heard someone say TB s top hat
I only ever associated it with his twitter pic Didn t know he actually ever wore one

Well maybe people are sick of saying NERF PYLON OVERCHARGE for like 3 months now
i dont think pylon overcharge is even OP i just think it is a silly game mechanic same for tankvacs i feel like theyre changes youd make in an arcade map for fooling around theyre just so ridiculous
I ve heard there s a new terrain unit with a mop and cleaner that walks around and cleans up creep but then the floor is slippery so Marines can t walk on it
Not nerf remove
Precisely the kind of retarded crap we must contrust against
sounds like non contrusive feedback
eh I dunno I think it has a place and it helps protoss deal with harassment which they really struggled with before It just shouldn t be able to defend any attack before the 20 minute mark Weaken it and make it less spammy
They need to nerf that OR adepts not both This just makes toss early game shit again
You mean to tell me not being able to expand and having to spend gas on sentries while terran and zerg safely expand and harass with tier 1 units wasn t ideal
oh no do you have to build units to defend your expansion why cant pylons just do it all
Why can t stalkers cost 50 minerals with tier 1 upgrades that make them 2x 3x as good
Because a stalker is way way stronger than a marine
David Kim has the patience of a saint There s no way I could deal with the 1000 s of gold league heroes thinking they understand the game and know EXACTLY what needs to be changed
I want you To take balancing seriously Edit This thread is 100 separate from the balance feedback So the comment that has points below me makes no sense whatsoever This was also a joke SC2 reddit is unreal
You are one of the people whose feedback is so uncontrustive that you only make the job harder
Whoosh
How does that make any sense at all when I am not even giving feeback on any of the balance changes This thread has nothing to do with the feedback for the game whatsoever so what are you actually getting at And obviously my comment was a joke
Your post implied that he doesn t take balancing seriously It was a clear and direct criticism of David Kim ergo it was a criticism of his balance changes along the line of You aren t taking the changes you make seriously Unless you intended it differently in which case you should have written it differently
It was a joke that wasn t even near the feedback thread or post Get real
If you don t understand what you yourself say then don t say it
Take a joke Stop taking things so seriously It s just the internet Don t worry about what I said D
I wish the mods banned dumbfucks like you from this subreddit

Can you rewrite this in English please
No new maps for you
What uncostructive feedback he is talking about Sorry not following the game lately But when I was leaving Kim had kind of shitty reputation and it wasn t completely undeserved Does that changed
You weren t listening to us back in 2010 Our patience has ended Hope you re happy what you did to our game Because we aren t
Hey David what about analyzing DATA as hard evidence instead of listening to peoples rant Yunno doing your job
Should have gone with Alarak and been more assertive
Well it s not like Blizz is doing anything we expect them to do like new maps leave league bugs other stuff blizz promised
Honestly they should be thrilled that they re getting so much free feedback regardless of positive negative Some businesses have to pay a fortune to understand customer sentiment and DK s team get it for free then complain about it If they don t have the infrastructure in place to filter it and separate signal from noise and or it s causing poor morale that s entirely the responsibility of their management teams not the customer s problem Insinuating that their recent minimal efforts to have some dialogue with the community aka transparency are to fault for unrealistic expectations and not the fact that Blizzard themselves hyped these features is laughable Asking the community of paying customers to lay off on their harmful internet words was pathetic and frankly just came off as more PR intended to obfuscate the fact that Blizzard s focus isn t really on this game although they continue to pay it lip service If what we re seeing really represents the efforts of a full team I don t know what to say The right response when your customers complain en masse is to say that you totally understand where the complaints are coming from will make every effort to expedite changes the community wants but make no guarantees and then proceed in the best way forward for the business after understanding the cost benefit of addressing the user complaints ahead of your slated development calendar Unfortunately it looks like Blizzard s cost benefit analysis is consistently falling on the side of less investment in SC2 but taking passive aggressive shots at the community is weak regardless
He is the worst thing to ever happen to starcraft
Why is that As someone who doesn t follow this very closely I d be interested to read a nice write up
Oh Fuck off
He hasn t had a mind for balance in a decade He made a few good suggestions in sc1 but that s it
you re not mildly funny you re completely unfunny
I actually found that quite funny
I wish i had a job where i ask other people to do it for me
here is additional constructive feedback give us ghost skin for nova now pls I pre bought only reason is because of skin I don t care about the campaigns I shit you not I want to rush protoss with female ghost bitchs david kim pls
English pls
he sucksSorry but this game is balanced by front page reddit threads not actual numbers P players need to whine harder if they want a playable race
PvT 277 242 53 37 PvZ 386 438 46 84 TvZ 360 333 51 95 copy pasted from aligulac from most recent
But that being said please don t become whiners y all It s so pointless and demeaning when people whine at every drop of the dime Not only does it make those of us who still come here die inside a little each time we do it wastes the time of the devs who have to sifting through all of that crap in their quest to find constructive feedback
Looks like we have no choice I want a playable race man
This this this this this this this
Why does it always go this way When PvT was protoss favored the entire frontpage was filled with these nonsense posts But when it s terran favored no one bats an eye This is ridiculous and the terran bias is sickening Protoss players really got to stand up and whine more maybe we need an avilo of our own
Since patch 1 3 except for a very brief dip for the HotS release I don t see this graph go below 45 for PvT while it does appear to hit 55 twice Anything in the 47 to 53 range should be expected The ways you won TvP such as SCV pulls and the ways you lost TvP too many to list made the game unfun to play There is a difference between not having fun because you lose and not having fun because you had to do a checklist of things of every game or else you lose
It s kind of funny how Protoss players are whining more about Terrans whining about their 49 TvP than they whine about their own 41 PvZ And you can almost argue that the former is a bigger problem to whine about anyway
Why is that shocking Terrans were making out that TvP was unwinnable and that Protoss was broken as fuck when in fact when if you surivied past the early shit Protoss had an almost impossible army to fight against bio with tanks and liberators It seemed so outrageous how much complaining they where doing because it was from notable figures and all over Reddit to a level that Protoss never has That it rubbed a lot of Protosses like me the wrong way ZvP is fucked but then that seemed obvious and making ultras and lurkers basically invincible seemed like something they would ofc fix but no Well GGWP Reddit and Terran pro s alike I just hope a Protoss wins no other tournaments for fear of more nurfs
This reddit has far more terrans than protoss Just watch the votes on this post
You re right but I m not sure whether to upvote or downvote you
It s reverse psychology to get the terrans to give me karma Already working to the tune of about 2
please tell me the last time period when pvt was terran favoured
Month of January 2016 as statistics show
Pvz has never really been protoss favored not anymote than when the was Terran favored
deleted
1 supply roaches come to mind when thinking of things more broken than broodlord infestor
Speed voidrays too Sweet jesus those were the days
Late game wasn t super prevalent in those days though
Beta
nah broken was when there were barracks before supply depots
I don t know why you are getting down voted Terran had a 33 wr vs zerg at the end of WoL It s not nearly as bad as the broodlord infestor days
WARHOUNDS
if you look at history part right now PvZ is 47 learn to use websites
No I also posted match statistics and tha graph is from beginning of January PvZ Is 46 8 from January 20 now so you do want the fork
Ya the graph hasn t been updated but you re right I m eating my words with a side salad right now tasty
And yet at high levels of play PtitDrogo wins Dreamhack over zerg and in Code A Protoss players are holding their own just fine in PvZ Also CJherO and Myunsik won both of the GSL preseasons herO beating world class zerg on the way In terms of actual gameplay Protoss has a lot of potential with phoenix into chargelot archon immortal They can also mix in warp prism adept harass which requires a very different reaponse from zerg than phoenix Somehow the stats say zerg is massively favored but it s not showing in top level gameplay or results
IMO The style that they use is just too hard for people below low master Yeah it is successful but demands a ton of multitask heavy macro even under pressure you have to always harass the zerg your phoenix can t be inactive more than 15 20 seconds PICA style and the only one that really works against zergs is really about having an excellent macro multitask to be successful And in the other hands zergs just go for roach ravager or lurkers without having to do anything but bases and drones But if you look at the GSL PvZ is 40 60 so there is still something wrong i guess And with the new PO nerf i would really like to see how korean pros handle early pools or even speedlings all in
Sounds like BW where if you could multitask like Bisu PvZ was easy
Except for when you get hydra busted
It isnt hard to execute Whats hard for lowbies is not running their entire army into lurkers and dying Its the same reason low ranks complain about disruptors all the time If you re not watch your army and dont preemptively position your units youlre gonna have a bad day
Well if you miss the harass part pressure presence on the map you won t be able to do anything
I think what you re saying is if you re can t put pressure on the map then the zerg runs rampant Or am I misinterpreting you If it is the above then ya I agree that keeping pressure on zerg is pretty hard as toss WPadept is helpful and will remain so but zerg s defensive capabilities are really strong with roachrava if it isn t any kind of multiprong harass or if the zerg has awesome creep spread
I don t say it s hard well i mean it is when you are mid master with 200 EPM If you can put some pressure on the zerg without letting your mineral reach 1k you are fine if you can t well you might get a little bit rekt IMO PICA is the only build efficient in the current meta macro build cuz as always all ins work quite well Phoenix opening to prevent muta i won like 20 games this season just by doing the double stargates opening because a lot of zergs are going fast muta without scouting the protoss because they are expecting some kind of zealot immo or adept immo all in And anyway now mutalisks are just way too scary to handle without a fleet of phoenix Archons for aoe vs speedlings and ultras and they are effective versus anything anyway cuz of their biologic bonus damage Immortals to annihilate roaches ravagers but you need sentries as well in the mid game and prevent or immediately kill the ultras Chargelots to kill the rest and you need to warp a lot of them in the zerg base while you are fighting with your main army again multitask With some storms and tempests for bullshitlords transition this seems to be the best composition you can get in PvZ But like i said you need a really good an excellent even to get that out in time and multitask to not let the zerg spread You must have a total control of the game I quite like this matchup because you really have to scout constantly to know where the zerg is going to get your extra robots stargates in time etc But early pools or speedlings all in are a real cancer the maps pool is probably the biggest issue tho And PO nerf won t help x And btw zergs KR and EU don t have the same gameplay EU zergs are a lot more agressive than KR ones This is MY OPINION not a divine truth so just don t shit on me pls D
Templar tempest is really strong lategame vs BL corruptor viper Oracles are necessary sprinkled in and once you get the right composition just liter bases with cannons The lategame imo only suffers when you let hte zerg remax really quickly Tech switches always favor the zerg
I would say PICA is even broken It s just a lot of people die before getting there So zerg early aggression is as broken Not the best state to be in I m not sure how new PO changes it
With a good army control engagement it is But most of people just think that it is a A moving comp So when they play it they a move and lose and say zerg is OP anyway Without even trying to play it correctly
TBH chargelot archon immortal actually does pretty well when a moved against lurkers as long as it s not up a ramp and or through a choke The chargelots quickly spread and don t take much splash then the archons and immortals can safely and quickly deal huge damage to the roach hydra lurker I play mostly random in LotV and I m certainly not a very high level player I still win a good amount of PvZ by just a moving PICA at zerg and doing some minimal micro such as phoenix lifts guardian shield immortal targeting etc
Mmm I agree with the premise that CAI is a very a movey composition but I have fought similar fights with pre splitting focusing immortals on lurkers and general micro like that and some engagements I ve been pretty lazy with The difference is quite staggering if you don t do at least some micro
Hey I follow the scene off and on What is this PiCA style I m low master NA as Zerg so i know basics of the game and all just not sure what this term refers to Not entirely up on the current meta game really
Phoenix Immortal Chargelot Archon
Sorry but Muta micro isn t exactly the same as phx micro please remember u need to individually pick up every thing you want to kill It requires a lot more from protoss also considering to warp in you need to look away from your phx do your warp in and then return to phx micro
Yeah but on the other part mutas are less tanky and you have to be more carefull with your mutas And maybe you didn t notice that but muta players also often individually click on their targets to make it more efficient And as Zergplayer you have to go back for injecting and creepspreading
Dude phoenix are paper and they die so fast to things like hydra
Yeah and know imagin how fast mutas they and how much more carefull you have to be because of that
Well they are tankier than Muta They cost 25 more but have 50 more health I don t think it s fair to say that one is harder to use than the other They are both fragile and need to be babysat all the time
Compared to a critical mass of mutalisk phoenix are pretty underwhelming We will see with the new viper nerfs now though
Still not as hard imo playing zerg is still alot easier right now especially in lower leagues
Its completely subjective and playstyle dependent Ive been playing random in diamond for a long time and i just rush psionic storm in pvz with a 70 winrate
Not really people often make the mistake that some races are easier to play than others but that s wrong it depends mostly on the playstyle You can t say race x is harder than race y without referring to a playstyle Because it s the playstyle which makes something hard or easier
Phoenix micro isn t any more difficult than Muta micro I understand where you are coming from but having to use an ability doesn t make things magically harder Both require constant babysitting and target firing Hint Setup rapid fire for Graviton Beam for an even easier time
Ok a couple things I don t think I m winning at all its just a straight up fact that protoss standard playstyle is currently more difficulty on average then zerg Don t worry about my games I never said I m having problems vs I m fine because I can multitasking and macro unlike most lower level player we are referring to I don t know anyone that uses rapid fire for grav beam and have never seen any pros use it The reason being you run into the same problem as using it on feedback it super ineffecint and could maybe work if you had a ton of phx and nothing but workers in a mineral line but if the zerg was smart he s gonna move roaches or ling around his workers and really mess you up Again you can fuk off with your git gud and try harder bullshit no matter how you look at it if you go mass Muta as zerg your going to have a easier time then going phx You know why low level players complain about Muta being strong still it s to hard to control phx while doing everything else to make sure you don t die to a ground push so they don t make them Throw in the fact you can stack injects now and zerg gets even easier when you lapse on Marco So please learn a thing or two about the races before you make judgment on them
it is kind of ridiculous how zerg can faceroll roach ravager while protoss has to work their ass off to even stand a chance Regardless of where the s end up this is just not fair It s a little reminiscent of PvT a while back when protoss just had to 1a more or less with the colossus deathball but terran really had to micro and macro their hearts out but more severe
If you look at the GSL Protoss is currently the most represented race in Code S If you include the qualifiers there are factors like no names and ex pros being bounced out by existing pros more in some matchups than others They don t all neatly cancel out
weren t the code S qualifiers pre patch before the MSC nerf 41 winrate is post patch
The patch hit on the 29th after code S on the 30th in Korea Not a single Korean tournament game has been played on the patch
There are alternatives for lower league players phoenixes arent really necessary to deal with lurkers which are the main problem for most protosses A really simple way to approach it is by going for an oracle opening with fast 3 bases into chargelot immortal archon then a moving into the zergs army with revelation on the lurkers Only requires basic macro and no micro needed I dont use phoenixes either because my protoss mechanics are still new and awkward making it hard to multitask while macroing well I cant say its enough at GM level since I m not there but works for me in masters offracing as protoss
You do realize aligulac counts like no games Bellow masters right
that s exactly why he s using it the game is balanced at the pro level first
PICA isn t that hard you can literally just amove with ICA Roach Ravager Lurker is harder to handel than ICA Protoss had harder unit comps in HotS like blinkstalker sentry And it s not like pheonixes are that essential in the midgame if you have your groundarmy out And things like heavy macro even under pressure harass etc etc are things which count for every race also depending on the playstyle Zergs also need to have excellent macro maybe a bit less multitasking but more good positioning etc etc You re implying that zergs have it way easier than p which is simply not true Especially ICA is one of the easier unitcomps protoss had in starcraft while the midgame for zergs is harder than ever I think it s more that Lurker and Ravager are so strong and easy to get But it s hard to changes something while protoss does quite well at the toplevel I think the best step would be changing the mappool and make it more protoss favored or at least not so zerg favored like this one and then taking from there
That s exactly what i am saying Protoss do extremely well at high level against zergs because they have the mechanics APM to do so I see a lot of Top master GM ruining zergs in PvZ with this build expect on Ulrena and Prion Cancerraces But below this level of play or without this build it s kind of zerg favored
Yeah and lower level zergs also don t have the apm mechanics of a higher level zergs so it s balances itself out And on lower level there are many things which are inbalanced just because they can handel it Adapts Overlord drops Force Fields Widow Mines are all things which are inbalanced below a certain level What you re essentially implying is that zerg is easier to play that s why they re so strong at lower levels But you have nothing to back this assumption up you just feel that zerg is easier to play
Remember that when you re playing in diamond MMR you re playing against diamond zergs You might not be as good at managing your phoenixes but the zergs will be proportionally worse at keeping the harassment under control as well
You can literally a move ontop of Lurkers with PICA and still win the fight as long as you engage reasonably well and use Graviton Hell if you didn t go Phoenix you don t even need to worry about Graviton and can still win the fight No other ground army in the game can a move Lurkers and get away with it
Well that s not totally true Unless the zerg is caught of guard it s kind of hard Using graviton on lurkers if kind of risky because there are hydralisks just under your phoenix and actually there is a bug that make lurkers insta burrow when they are dropped off the graviton beam when they are attacking and you pick them up when the graviton wears off they insta burrow and continue attacking like nothing happened You can t engage lurkers which are being defensive just impossible because they are well spread zergs amy is in arc and spores are just next to the lurkers So you have to go for the late game with Tempest and Templars But yeah if you catch the zerg in the middle of the map with a good concave and storms you have a really good chance But it s not a moving you have to prepare to engage and choose the right place Map like Dusk Tower are awful vs lurkers because there is not enough place to engage them properly
That s true if the Zerg is in a defensive position you can t really attack into Lurkers I was referring to fights in the middle or on your side of the map To break defensive positions you need to split his army through the use of WP harass
Wait isn t it the zergs that need multitasking Zergs are constantly being abused harassed non stop PvZ 2 gate adept warp prism adept phoenixes DTs etc TvZ reapers hellions cloaked banshees liberators bio drops In XvZ the zergs rarely do early mid game harassment it s the zergs that need insane multitasking Defending requires a LOT more attention micro than being offensive not the protoss terrans
Yeah they are showing stats of foreign zvp where Protosses dont do Stargate into chargelot archon immortal Honestly Protosses that are bitching just refuse to copy the successful pvz strats from koreans for some dumb reason There is literally no reason not to open stargate phoenix it s the best opening by far for Protoss
PvZ is 42 in the GSL
This includes matches before Protosses learned how to play no While I do think Zerg is slightly favored in this MU from what I ve seen Protoss players just aren t abusing the right tools often enough
Well a ton of that is when adepts still 2 shotted drones larva in the early game before 1 and a lot of P s wins in that were either won or got a big lead because of early game adept rushes sooo yeah Expect PvZ to drop dramatically in GSL as well as across the board Early adept stuff was hiding how low the actually is
Adepts can still 2 shot drones Not being able to 2 shot larva is not a big deal because 90 of the time you are busy with drones Wanna bet that the win rates will go up from now on despite the PO nerf
My bad on the misinformation Still makes no sense that the winrates would go up PO change is definitely a nerf PvZ and the only slight buff toss got was to skytoss and that s probably not something that toss will be able to turtle into in enough games to affect the winrates much I think 2 shot larva matters some I see a lot of pros do it if they can t reach the drones at the time or if they think a bunch of roaches whatever are going to be made soon to defend etc
I bet 50 Imaginary Points they go down
This kind of shit is exactly why looking at the game is useless people will always see what they want to see to justify what they want to be true
I saw plenty of people try that very build at dreamhack to very limited success once the zerg players moved into lurkers more intelligently Once there were 8 to 10 of them with roach hydra support that comp melted like everything else
If you don t have the mechanics for it it s pointless
You want your easy a move win don t you
We want fairness aka amove wins just like zerg gets amove wins for the last 5 years
Fairness http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Premier Tournaments Protoss won more premier tournaments than Zerg and Terran combined in 2015 In 2014 they won seven premier tournaments in a row In late Wings Protoss even during the Broodlord Infestor era still managed to take nearly even tournament wins from Zerg So which it is Are you severely deluded or a troll
Meanwhile you just ignore that when counting winners runner ups it s zerg that has the most in 2015
Right Because runner ups certainly has as much bearing as winners
Exactly They just have 1 series between them and winning out of the 2 dozen they played to get to the finals
I was obviously being sarcastic Look at how many more wins the Protoss got out of ALL those b05 and bo7s and what have you But I know your debate style and how you attribute it all to coincidence Doesn t matter how implausible it all becomes There are no absolutes in this world But what is certain that by percentage and likelihood alone I am much more likely to be correct
Same goes for all the toss who complained about swarmhosts when they were basically unplayable in high level korean matches because korean protosses knew how to use a warp prism
As a zerg I actually find protoss especially opening phoenix pretty weak I almost never lose because I ve figured out what to do Alot of zerg s that I ve been watching don t do what I do They either try infestors which sucks or hydra lurker which sucks vs this as well or go corruptor which is I think the be st the response but they just defend with the corruptors Once I get 10 out I push the phoenix s back by attacking their bases Phoenix tickle me and since they re putting all their resources in zealot and immortal I pick off bases really easily If they move out by 8 30 which is what drogo was doing in dreamhack I already have a sizeable ling baneling army that crushes the size army that drogo would have And ultra cavern is already on the way by 8 30 so by resetting the army it s just too easy to kill protoss at this point One game this exact scenario happened and while he was trying to attack me my corruptors have killed three bases I just find the style insanely weak shrug Also I start greater spire so I can turn those 10 corruptors on the map into broodlords if I want a death army I d be curious to play better protosses But I ve done this vs top masters on NA and on korea
DAE anything besides Code S champs is shit gameplay Also GSL code S champs is shit gameplay if reddit doesn t like the players
When will r starcraft just accept that no one will ever be good at starcraft
Why would you bring up Code S when Dreamhack wasn t even equal to any group in the Code A qualifiers
Code S champd are shit gameplay too unless they were brood war champions
dae foreigners still be shit compared to korea
You can always cherrypick any player who is doing well in any meta and conversely cherry pick any player doing poorly in any meta I don t really follow the non Korean scene very closely so maybe there are things going on there that I don t see but it feels really suspect to draw any conclusions from anything you have cited
Maybe because it s a small sample of the best players Stats about central tendencies of appropriately sized samples
Everything you just said about pro players occured pre patch I think its best to wait a few weeks and see what happens iem tapei proleague gsl ssl but I dont think you can use matches from pre patch to back up your claims the overcharge nerf will probably have a result in a change in the matchup For example cj hero was taking pre 3 mimute 3rd bases in many of his macro wins vs zerg cant see that being possible with the new PO
And yet departure and dark already showed how to crush the fast third that is the only thing keeping that winrate above 40 Just wait for some more zergs to do it and 41 25
yeh that is the more correct approach look at what high level players are doing who have played loads of games are doing a zvp victory for zerg means a lot less bout balance if it is between two low tier players This is something that isnt accounted for in any of these stats that people keep slinging
dont forget that Neeb crushed violet and huk lost 2 3 to petraeus showtime wrecked firecake 3 0 and harstem 3 0d bly in the WCS something qualifier
Have one third of the playable races balanced at only the absolute highest levels of play is a serious problem given the fact that for 99 of players maining Protoss is completely unfeasible If anything they should be focusing on balance across standard levels of play because who actually cares about professional e sports in 2016
Dude the top level is the only level where balance matters If zerg is easier to play you will just be matched against zergs with less skill than you having even games and everyone is having fun
It strongly suggests then that Protoss is a lot harder to play right now in PvZ than Zerg
At last a race is easier to play than protoss
Oh yes lets nerf overcharge that def wont have big consuquences in the zerg match up
I think its necessary though Overcharge limits both races from pressuring protoss which is why you see them greedily taking 3 base and just throwing pylons down to defend Now protoss will have to use units as well as PO to defend which honestly could lead to some severe protoss losses But at least then they can buff other units to reel the matchups back into balance
And because blizzard only patch one incorrect thing every 4 months protoss will be unplayable for all of season 2
Well they released a few minor patches before this but for the most part 3 months isn t so bad
Explain why Protoss steamrolls Zerg in tournaments
And without it we can t hold any pressure at all nerfing it has made protoss unplayable at high levels
I think what people want is a nerf to the overcharge and a buff to something else At least some unit not a building Blizzard recognizes the great things from BW to include the lurker in LotV and understood Terrans were missing some sort of mobile space control spider widow mine for HotS I think with protoss everything lies with the stalker Singularity Charge from BW so dragoons increased range is so important Just like ling speed stim I m not saying that it should be included i just think an upgrade to increase the strength of toss core units should be made to allow for the mid game madness It is going to be difficult but i think this is where the answer lies Could be wrong though
I wouldn t go so far as to say unplayable It is definitely difficult to win in PvZ but that has a lot more to do with lurkers viper corruptor BL than anything imo Don t get me wrong rorava is a terrifying thing to deal with The fact that there are multiple timings means its not always easy to predict But I think that protosses will just have to find ways of pressuring earlier like with phoenix harass or immortal pressure with recall and maybe take a 3rd a bit later than normal to win games
Those stats are Pre patch means we needed those supidly greedy builds imo In return this will lead to nerfs for Zerg
This is before that too Should be fun to see a race finally get into 30 s winrates
When you stop to think about it holy shit Starcraft is so balanced 41 59 is the worst the game has ever gotten Shit in other games counters are so hard you often have 10 chance to beat your counter much less 41
Yup but it s not the current circlejerk so you never hear about that
This is always what made me love the game and stay loyal since I ve been a little kid Unfortunately many don t see it that way and it s been hard to get my friends into it
Other games don t have only 3 races What a horrible comparison
Well every race in sc2 have many units I is not 3 units or 10 it much more Do the math Kappa
The individual units themselves aren t supposed to be balanced against each other That s not how any of this works
Which just infinitely complicates things
That s just moving the goal post In any other case where counters are 10 they are talking about specific units heroes abilities No other game has a faction that has less than 10 Winrate vs another That s just not how any of this works and is the dumbest circlejerk this sub has thought of in a while Use a single other esports to make a counterargument I dare ya cuz it s not possible
So let s nerf Protoss two best things and give them no buffs BRILLIANT
To be fair the Adept nerf didn t affect PvZ that much The overcharge nerf is huge tho
It s really hard to compete with mass zerglings right now
The adept change doesn t affect that though The adept will always 2 shot a zergling no matter what upgrades either of them has
Honest question at what stage of the game Late game don t you have disruptors and colossi Early game adepts still kill zerglings in the same number of shots so can you make more units Also doesn t the overcharge change kill more zerglings faster
Disruptors are pretty bad vs lings
I could just be bad but I m remembering a game I played where the protoss had chargelots and immortals between his disruptors and my crackling ultras I couldn t get to his disruptors and it was GG Tasteless
Well if the lings get held up behind the Ultras that could be a problem but if the lings are up front and get all over his stuff it s very difficult to land a disruptor shot without killing plenty of your own units
Nobody makes colossus or disruptors these days Chargelot archon is what kills the lings Untill that adepts dont trade cost effectively with lings without the upgrades and making a wall is rather impossible given how greedy you must play
Zerg 2 base 20 25 drones then mass zerglings and maybe banelings You can t really string overcharges anymore so it s hard to make a wall and have a more than 4 adepts and a 2nd base before zerg has about 30 lings
The dmg change did nothing agaunst lings Adepts still trade poorly against lings enmasse Lings have 35 hp Adepts do 22 dmg Before they did 23 In both cases it takes 2 full attacks to kill a ling PO on the other hand was nerfed and due to its delay in attack lings are a bit better at engaging now Morevoer corrsive bile is more powerful againat PO defenses
If you feel adepts trade poorly versus mass lings your either severly outnumbered because of terrible macro and or really mismicroing your adepts because adepts are basically 1 roaches for 25 more minerals and 1 roaches 2 shotting zerglings is practically a free win in zvz In pvz I do tend to defend adept attacks with zerglings because roaches don t do damage fast enough to adepts and adept attacks are all about trying to kill drones so faster killing adepts is more valuable but if I am anticipating a medium to large adept attack I always need to have an emergency bane nest because once a big ball of adepts gets formed you ll lose like 1 3 to half your lings just getting into melee range
You can theory craft all you want but adepts before the attack speed upgrade arent greatbvs lings 4 lings which is way cheaper than an adept can kill her before she kills 3 lings Moreover bile is a far more cost efficient way of dealing with slow moving adepts than banes Banes trsde horribly with adepts
You seem to be theory crafting as well 1 adept beats 4 speedlings when stutter stepped kited In larger numbers Yes adepts don t scale well before upgrades but that is assuming completely in the open engagements with no stutter micro or shade usage Adept attacks almost always involve kiting around wedging between mineral lines and shading between bases adept defenses are similar at the toss base
They only got 1 nerf vs Zerg Don t be stupid
Technically 2 Adept now 3 shot larvae instead of 2 shot Not a big deal but still a nerf p
You re missing a bit the point One nerf only affects PvT and zergs winning because of lurker and ravager are so strong and zergs have in general a strong lategame So the photon overcharge nerf doesn t effect that in any way And it s harder to balance PvZ because despite the numbers protoss is actually doing quite well Maybe a better mappool would already balance the numbers a bit more
That s true your right Hope we see a lurker and ravager nerf soon
deleted
Where did you see this 15 drop
I think there need s to be more maps with free naturals and a third with a chokepoint I m pretty sure the very zerg favored maps are the real issue with PvZ A decent chokepoint would make it easier for toss to defend against zerg all ins while toss does some aggressive harass with wp or air Drops and nydus I think could use some tweaks and maybe do something about ravager bile building damage everything else seems pretty fine though
making turtle maps as a band aid fix for a weak race is a bad idea then the game will be balanced around boring maps and you re stuck with them
Toss just dont whine as hard a terran Terran wont be happy until all matchs up are 99 999 TvX
Perfect example of why no one should other with anything said in r starcraft
It s going to get worse there hasn t been enough matches since the patch to drive the down Give it time it may reach the lowest matchup in the history of SC2 This is not a protoss QQing I just objectively believe this will happen given the fact that early game adept stuff was propping up the already low PvZ s before and now that it s mostly gone the will drop like a rock
the circle jerk is real
A number of Protoss builds could be slightly too greedy now for all we know More games need to be played b c if it s a difference of having 1 extra adept in the mineral line vs speedlings maybe you can delay an extra gateway and suck it up He s committing you commit something to not have to commit completely I have faith high level Protosses will show proper build placement adept usage and the more sparing POs can hold attacks fine with potentially slightly more conservative builds at the worst The question once the dust settles is Is it too much to the point zergs can auto outmacro when forcing certain reactions A number of you are feeling the immediate effects while also experiencing zergs trying to take advantage of that It doesn t surprise me at all that protosses who are so dependent on their BO s and compositions to be tripped up by their first nerf Let the dust settle first imo
Those stats are Pre patch means we needed those supidly greedy builds imo to just hold any ground Now this win percentage is just to go down even more
its offical we need a 10 shield buff on zealots
Protoss fucked up by winning a tournament I would love to see a graph showing the ratio of Protoss s winning tournaments and Protoss then getting nerfed Games rigged
Shouldnt be in a haste and find the exact error first not yet found a new playstyle after adept nerf maps favoring zerg specific units too weak Take the time and find the best solution for this problem also Im sure soon the winrate will increase a little bit again Shotime just 3 0 ed bly with archon immortal style
Those stats are Pre patch
oh rip then D
The game hasn t been played that long Protoss got changed massively Give it time and patience see if it will swing back Also work hard to identify specific situations in which Z won that they maybe should not have Without patience and evidence Blizz likely won t act
MY ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SAYS PROTOSS IS OP PLZ NERF pulls up statistical evidence that opposes opinion THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE IS FLAWED BECAUSE ANECDOTAL REASON
What s hilarious is how PvT plummeted with the launch of LotV contrary to what the b net whiners would have you and apparently DK believe
Its pretty easy Because of their higher winrate vs terrans prenerf their MMR got higher and so they had to face Zergs with higher MMR and so had a lower winrate After the latest nerf the protoss will face zergs on the same level and the winrate will get better When for example you know a cyclone timing which beats every protoss you will get masters with the kills vs protoss but will loose to probably every zerg since every protoss used adepts vs terrans to get easy wins they will have a harder time vs zerg
Those are tournament stats
It s because roach ravager all in and every variation of it is super difficult to hold at almost all levels I ve even seen zergs just 3 base and mass all muta and its completely viable even if you scout spire The reason protoss at the highest level can manage is pro players are able to get adept damage pressure in the early game and gain a very slight advantage For everyone else they just have to manage
This is just misinformation First if we are going to talk about all ins Protoss still have insanely strong all ins they aren t any worse than Zerg s As for 3 base Muta there is no fucking way he can keep massing Muta if you scout it You can hold just fine until Phoenix are out Early on you rarely see more than a small Muta flock because they are easy to counter their real strength lies in sudden tech switches
Name a protoss all in build that can work at the masters level that you can use on 2 bases before the zerg push comes maxed out at 200 200 I have seen a litany of builds from zerg 3 base that are incredibly difficult to hold at all levels Protoss is forced into the same opener every game versus zerg unless they like dying to those tech switches It s insanely easy for any zerg to craft any all in on 3 bases and push the protoss for a kill It takes tons of metagame knowledge and lots of scouting from protoss to hold that push and survive
7 gate Blink Stalker with Warp Prism Works great in close spawn Ruins of Seras and Orbital you can just jerk around the bases and as long as you keep the prism safe from Queens Bile you win Zerg can t stop this unless they scout it Chargelot Immortal all in works on most maps 3 base 200 200 Zerg pushes are not all ins they hit on 8 30 at the earliest Realistically that won t happen unless you leave the Zerg alone for the entirety of the game which is your fault You have easy harass with units like Adepts Prism Oracles and Phoenix This also doubles up as a scouting method This buys you enough time to create an army and do some sim city which is really really helpful vs Zerg
It s really not that hard for zerg to scout any of those builds and I have yet to see chargelot immortal do anything against roach heavy builds and again that s an easy switch into muta which would leave you completely open for an easy tech counter I could see the 7 gate work but that s considering the zerg isn t already doing aggression and you are able to micro well enough and keep your prism alive with ravagers and queens going off If the all in fails you lose the game straight up For zerg they can throw a powerful 3 base at you take a 4th and commit or not and still get good gains It s less about the build orders themselves and more that protoss is pigon holed into 2 star 2 robo builds just IN CASE they decide to throw a crazy aggro build at you I ve seen the damage that can be done with phoenix opener oracle and adepts and its really negligible on the zerg economy unless they are making big mistakes Good zergs or bad are going to use those builds and throw them fierce with good ravager micro or not Now with the pylon nerf that sim city isn t going to do much I ve held the all ins before its all possible for protoss to survive and make good choices but in the ladder meta its simply just stupid how simplistic the zergs builds can be and how overly complicated the protoss builds have to be to hold I don t even try to do anything different in PvZ or I just get steamrolled
You don t need to kill many Drones when harassing Zerg that would just be the cherry on top Forcing him to waste larva on units and keeping him on edge is good enough to severely delay or weaken the eventual push You underestimate the usefulness of chokes against roach or ling based armies imo I can t count the times where I was pushed back due to good building placement despite having a superior army
and what have you calculated for the correct winrate to be if the game were perfectly balanced
Sure but we aren t terrans bitching it up on r starcraft so good luck getting any attention or patches in your favor
I played protoss for 3 years being diamond for a couple season and now I lose to plat zergs on a regular basis caused me to switch to terran and play only unranked very disheartening
Protoss players got lazy during HotS They have to learn the game again now that it s not just EZPZ Force Fields MSC bullshit and Blinks anymore
Just adapt
You are absolutely right Protoss is no longer handed wins as easily and they just complain
Show this to the sheep in Twitch chat and they will still claim Protoss is an easy race that wins because the race exists
Protoss need to learn that they can no longer mass stalker A move Give it a few months for them to adapt to having to use strategy and the win rates will be up Wow downvote as soon as I said that stay salty Protoss D
Zergy is mad hes getting called a patch zerg again
protoss still used to stupidly greedy builds imo what a joke that it was viable for protoss to double expand and hold with some adepts and pylon cannons
Those stats are Pre patch means we needed those supidly greedy builds imo to just hold any ground
still got your brain stuck in hots
so that s the reason I m still in silver league not because I m bad but because Zerg is imba wow thanks inaccurate statistics
Byun is rank 1 player in the world by a huge margin http aligulac com players 47 ByuN Seriously you can t use aligulac without taking it with a large grain of salt
byun actually could be number one now in legacy
aligulac com uses an algorithm very similar to what the ATP adopted for tennis and other individual sport leagues use to rank professional athletes ofc it is not supposed to be accurate when telling who the actual best player is at a given time on the other hand inference they provide based on pure tournament matches win rates are indeed reliable and accurate considering how unpredictable a game such as Starcraft can be
except when people are using an out of date graph showing the balance its currently PvT 277 242 53 37 PvZ 386 438 46 84 TvZ 360 333 51 95 from Jan 20 Now
You re right that the algorithm is similar However the algorithm they use in the ATP has way way more qualitative stats to define the the skill of an individual player We only have winrates Moreover the analytics never never try to claim france is statistically better than britain in tennis with just winrates Yet you come to SCreddit and people always try to prove racial balance using far inferior stats than even tennis use for equating skill Winrates are sadly just a very quantitative stat that doesn t describe much
If No 1 Protoss player has no problem in PvZ that is OK These statistics is useless
flawless logic
Just because one player can dominate doesn t mean that it s balanced It s a testament to his skill not a testament to the balance of the game Look at BW Bisu is an amazing player but protoss is weaker there Just because he can dominate does not mean that it s balanced He could probably dominate even more if things were more even I m not saying that PvZ is imbalanced all I m saying is that if the stats are so anomalous maybe there s something to be looked at Claiming everything is fine is just burying your head in the sand without first investigating And just as taking this particular stat by itself and scream Zerg imba is moronic dismissing it because one or a select few players are doing ok is also moronic IMHO there is something to be looked at here To me it says that the race has design issues that should be fixed there are aspects that can be overly abused which lead to insane winrates but without that abusive aspects the race is simply dead which leads to insane lossrates
Just gonna quit playing ladder until something is done about this fuck it
Literally unwinnable Memes
You re not going to fix the problem unless you rework Protoss Protoss has always been vastly overpowered or stupidly weak never a mixture of the two The Elmer s glue esque tweaks and fixes Blizzard roles out have proven to be ineffective and stupidThe decadence of foreign sc2 in 2016
I eat like shit and even I think that looks gross wtf
This is the result of koreans stealing foreigner money in tournaments With new WCS lets hope morrow will be able to afford some mac cheese in the near future
I would not keep my hopes high after all he s not a REAL PROGRAMER P
This is disgusting
My thoughts exactly
LMAO Just a hint of butter
This kid is going places
WutFace
It ketchup really less expensive than regular tomato sauce
Ketchup instead of actual pasta sauce DansGame morDuck
gross bro
Honey Boo Boo also eats ketchup and butter on her spaghetti
How do you know this
Bc I watch terrible tv On mobile here s link https m youtube com watch v qvlmXKtoi1A

It s really common in Sweden
And Norway afaIk
Still gross
What s that toilet paper for Morrow Late night fap sessions PvT
I like food too much to eat like that lol Why not eat something better tastier more nutrients and healthier when you re trying to be great at something
I couldn t watch the whole thing The sound of ketchup on pasta made me want to barf
No 1 Champion
morTarga the fuck is that
For some reason I want a player named Tomato to join Team Liquid
A perfect example of when the whole is less than the sum of its parts
Holy fuck that s gross step your fucking food game up pleb
Because ketchup and tomatosouce is so different Almoste all Swedes eats pasta with ketchup
It still doesnt qualify as a meal Tomatosauce expesially home made is totally different in sense of texture and taste Are you on drugs
nutrition wise nope of course not but nether dose macaroni and cheese i just dont se what so discussing with ketchp instead of tomato sauce even tho tomato sauce is better
Amazing camwork
pukes
Holy f that s gross haha wtf
God what happened to the orange jewce
I just threw up in my mouth a little If a pro gamer is willing to practise as hard as they have to to be the best wouldn t they also put in effort elsewhere to fulfil their potential Eating healthy isn t expensive if you go the Soylent Joylent Queal route Probably tastes better thought still disgusting as well
Ketchup DansGame
Ketchup Really breh Butter
That is not a hint of butter LOL
MorroW
morDuckThat part was so sad to read This community can be so caustic often with little reason
This is nothing You should have seen the r planetside community when they got upset Course planetside has a million and 1 problems that starcraft doesn t
I ve got 99 problems but planet side ain t one
Shiiet shoulda seen r globaloffensive when they released a recent patch Everyone was up in arms about making an FPS game fundamentally more RNG
Well DayBreak did fire their lead designer and the game is in a better state than what it was in when he was there
Higgles Higgles resigned And there as been basically no progress I mean I walked away after the drama got to much in my community They also hired Wrel which is seriously questionable and honestly smacks of desperation
The drama made you leave and yet you are still in r starcraft Holy shit that must have been some next level drama O
That drama was personal
This is true of every game community Satisfied people just don t care enough to post positive comments
There are positive circlejerks in pretty much every gaming community Much more than negatives The negatives just stick out more
Well even then the positives are usually more along the lines of don t change anything its perfect as it is developers are geniouses and released a masterpiece and shouldn t work on it any more instead of hey X was a great addition I really like that do more in the future please My favorite part was Y Like seriously no one ever gives them credit for how amazingly awesome it is that creep goes up the sides of buildings now or that workers just goto work at the start of the game instead of just sitting there going gee I wounder what we are going to do this game Mine minerals nope sit here and wait for orders or how about taking the time to make the carrier into a legit unit for those who liked it instead of removing it from the game since it was unused because the fighters where dumb
It s quite stupid to say they delivered an incomplete product Blizz s games are some of the most polished ever and in terms of content and love put into it they are probably one of the if not the best developers in the world But that doesn t necessarily make criticisms regarding their development speed invalid You just can t deny that over the decade of development time Blizz has put a fraction of new features and content into the game compared to what other often smaller development teams do Actually Blizz is completely known for their long development times Their games come out almost bug free every time and polished to a mirror sheen as a result but that doesn t change the fact that they just sometimes take ages to do stuff and seeing as we have seen other developers do more with less time while keeping up the same quality it s not unreasonable to conclude that there are probably some things in their development process which they could objectively do better in order to be faster without sacrificing any of the end quality or torturing their developers or any nonsense like that I guess my point is that Blizz should understand where this criticism is coming from and apply it to better themselves instead of getting demotivated For Starcraft 2 the criticism probably comes from a place where many in the community are worried because they have the subjective feeling that the game s community is going to shrink away until major features are implemented soon but games like CS GO have shown that games can stay relatively small and then grow to insane levels long after their initial release Actually CS GO is a good example People keep asking and asking about skins and voice packs for example I can t imagine this is so important to people because they don t enjoy the game without them I d rather assume that the people who keep asking about this assume that it s going to trigger some huge growth in the games community just like it did with CS GO And they may very well be right if Blizz handles it correctly
well its like honestly it will probably be better if the changes come out around the same time as Nova in terms of exposure Nova comes out a lot of the less competitive playerbase comes back to give it a go and boom there is a bunch a shit out while Sc2 is back into the spotlight Just a thought but I think it will be interesting to see what happens since they will be coming out near each other
Yeah the timing could be gold there
A lot of it is probably that Blizzard is more corporate in their job culture and they allow their developers to have lives Most companies in the gaming industry monopolize their employees lives and require 65 hour work weeks
You mean less corporate
More good kind of corporate
I always wondered what it s like to be a dev for an online game Work your ass off 8 hours a day go home and read some kid on the internet telling you that you re bad at your job
Honestly probably longer than 8 hours
Pre launch Probably 10 12 hours I can see the hours decreasing post launch since it s no longer crunch time and the focus is on delivering a polished product rather than a polished product immediately
In general all the time 10 12 hours Game development is notorious for having an absolutely brutal work culture Plus the pay is usually absolute shit compared to where qualified engineers could otherwise work Plus the engineering work requires solving extremely difficult problems compared to your typical software development job Game devs take game dev jobs because they love developing games Any given engineer at Blizz could walk into Google for a 1 5 2x increase in salary and great work life balance but they don t Why Because they like developing games That s why it s so shitty to see this community most of whom haven t the slightest clue about what goes into making a game criticize these folks for trying to make a great game
Talking to some friends at Google they re not working any less than the folks at Blizzard It s just a part of the big tech culture That said there s a pretty clear divide in comments complaining about development time between people who have actually touched high reliability scalable code bases and people who think that shit is easy or fast
Google has sneaked in a culture of living at your office and I don t think anyone realizes it s their fault As they continue to add office perks the average observer thinks Oh I want that too But what people don t realize is that if you re eating free breakfast lunch dinner in your office going to the office gym showering and napping at the office and using the office laundry and dry cleaning services you re not really ever at home
Who cares where you eat or do your laundry or nap or shower or whatever Do it where you want Googlers are free to The issue isn t that you re spending 10 hours on a campus of your own volition Google it s that you re spending 10 hours grinding out code because it is a requirement of the job Blizzard Check out the Glassdoor reviews of both companies sometime
You are free to But your boss notices who stays at the office and who doesn t I know what I m talking about I work in the gaming industry and have been in and out of non gaming tech industry for years I know a lot of people who went through Google Apple etc I currently live in Silicon Valley
My hours at the hospital are about 10 14 6 days a week Would gladly accept a park beds laundry and food that s not terrible
i don t think you do know what you are talking about when it comes to the work culture at a big 4 software shop so we ll have to agree to disagree on that one
It s team dependent in a huge organization like Google but in general they do not expect 7 5 hours Lots of friends there too
Work your ass off to feed your family get flamed by entitled kids complaining about a video game Just awful
This negativity didn t fall out of the sky let s be real Blizzard fostered it for years it s gonna be a while before what they ve improved has some visible results in how people perceive SC2 and Blizzard s devotion to the game
Dayvie being the better man
I just hope it motivates them to do more good work
The only reason we even entertained the notion that only 2 guys are working on sc2 or something like that is because it s the only forgivable reason we could come up with that it takes 4 week to fix a tiny thing or 6 months to show visible MMR from now and a million other crappy things we ve endured and are still enduring
Ah so what you are saying is you don t know anything about coding or game development because that s the only forgivable reason for a comment like this
Well their communication has sucked for years Maybe at the time to communication position was vacant P They brought it on themselves for the most part You reap what you sow and for them to reap something more positive it s gonna take a lot of sowing
then why does the heroes of the storm team for example manage to get much more done much quicker despite it being the same engine
They really don t Grandmaster league was announced at Blizzcon for heroes of the storm and Dustin Browder said on twitter a few days ago that they were still months away from implementing it This caused a shitstorm on twitter and reddit This is just a case of the grass is always greener
well im still going to complain because if they spent more time trying to come up with creative units and unit design instead of trying to force creativity through bad maps then I wouldn t complain but DK seems to think that gold bases and rocks are what makes this game creative which is bullshit some of the best games in SC2 and BW history are on very balanced and straightforward maps
complaining and criticizing are ok The way you do it is what matters
So you think this is any kind of constructive feedback They worked on units and unit design for months and even introduced new units during the beta There definitely doesnt go this much time into the selection of maps
I don t think I ve ever seen DKim come so close to straight up telling us to chill the fuck out Glad he said what he did at the end It s very needed tbh
DK has a strong heart and and even stronger back hand
and strongest is his wallet Actiblizzard must pay him a fortune for convincing everyone the community is the problem after saving tons of dev recources by recycling a discarded WoL beta unit
He never said the community is the problem All he said is that non constructive criticism is demotivating and counterproductive Which really isn t news
Blizzard I just want to say that I m enjoying this game a lot and I really appreciate the level of communication we are getting Thank you for a great game and I hope to see more content in the days to come
Make that 2 of us
Ima jump on this bandwagon too
We are legion But we don t make as much fuzz as the angry ones
Well we are busy actually playing or watching the game So we don t have as much time as all the shit posters
LOTV is awesome I m not saying that to be delusionally positive It s a very good multiplayer game Blizzard took big risks and thought the right way and should be rewarded for it There were always going to be haters of SC2 and LOTV and in periods they are going to sound like they represent the community as a whole They don t
Yeah LOTV brought me back to Starcraft I played a ton of WOL then HOTS came out and it was OK but my interest quickly waned I ve already played more multiplayer in LOTV than I did in HOTS
I feel like D Kim is my mom and he is disappointed in all of us for our unproductive criticism But really he makes a good point if people get too upset when talked about stuff hasn t happened yet then Blizzard just won t talk about their plans at all Also anyone saying Legacy was released as an unfinished game needs to play some non Blizzard games and see what that really means
I like how he finally called out all the idiots about the sc2 is a small team and They told us this feature was coming and it s been a month why don t we have it blizzardruinsthegame brokenpromises
That s because the overwatch beta was meant for creating hype not for actual beta testing rofl
Basically all Blizzard betas these days
Basically al modern public betas are balance testing with all the major bug testing sorted out in alpha
nah they asked a ton of detailed questions about my experience right before the beta ended and now I think they are off responding to it all and updating the game Most betas just ask you to vote on a few silly questions to help them figure out how to extract more money from you then roll the game out into the store the next week
Not really it s been offline so long for the very reason they are trying to balance the characters fix matchmaking and alter the maps
Yea it definitely was an unfinished product But the point of betas these days it to garner hype via limited access to a game It worked for them with hearthstone
Betas in multiplayer games tend to be more about balance than about bugfixing
Yeah we can t have it all transparency of future visions accompanied by close to immediate delivery of these future goals The community updates are GODLIKE I can t explain how much they mean it would be a shame to see Blizzard stop being transparent in their ideas just because they have stated some cool visions for the future then leading the community to lose all patience wanting everything to happen right away otherwise false accusations of all kinds are starting It s an extremely childish mindset that only hurts both parties I think the silent majority of people are really positive towards the approach Blizzard takes now with the awesome communication between us and the collective goal of making this game even greater
It would be a real shame if Blizzard reverted to its older self of less communication and less transparency The community really needs to be more mature and accept that Blizzard has their own vision for the game that might not match our own And that s OK
Dkim telling us this is how its gonna be Map diversity is something that blizzard wants to go forward with and we need to accept it and think of how to improve upon the maps and ideas that we have Love seeing Dkim sticking to his guns and responding back to the community
This is so sad how r starcraft changes it s opinion every fcking week There s a bandwagon of people that follow blindly the newest opinion out of anyone known in sc2 community Whenever some known community member says something negative a top post on r starcraft and top comments are how this person is right and FUCK BLIZZARD then someone else bounces the ball back and suddenly everyone protects Blizzard same thing with Thooorin we went from this guy knows shit about sc why is he even getting into it to say what u want about thorin but he is right and today we got again he doesn t know sc2 and his arguments are false or irrelevant this happens over and over again I don t know if on other subreddits it s the same and I don t care but I remember that this place used to not fcking shit on everything after 1 thing that we don t like and we didn t jump into the defence of anybody after he she spoke about the matter Can we please not fcking jump from one extreme to the other every damn 5 minutes
I honestly think most people fall in the middle and stay silent about things I think the problem is that whenever one of the extremes gets an opening to promote their narrative they pounce on it
This is right it s an unfortunate systemic consequence of large online communities
Yeah I m some bored of this shit that I don t answer all these circlejerk threads
nah its NEW I noticed the heroes reddit suddenly becoming much more toxic and displaying the behavior people are talking about here it started when a bunch of people started watching new like a hawk and downvoting anything that disagree with their hurt feelings No new ideas or opinions can make it out on either side the middle ground is completely suppressed only anything the hive find super popular can escape NEW usually by being an extreme view an extremely selfish viewpoint regular popular community shows or internet celebrity backing
Heroes subreddit is hilariously worse than starcraft It reminds me of r starcraft 4 years ago when I was 400 points here constantly getting downvoted whenever I criticized blizzard for LAN or whatever reason But I never got banned for sharing my unpopular opinion while I got banned from Heroes cuz after playing over 1000 games I couldn t accept anymore how pathetically amateur Blizzard are in a lot of cases Later when the hype around the game starts dying out the bandwagoners and morons leave and the circlejerk starts turning around It s the circle of sub lives
Yeah I think it got a huge influx of people from lol dota that shifted after a few streamers antics caught on There are still a large group of then in denile about heroes being a different game than LoL or DoTa Posts that praise the differences or ask the team to try new things get downvoted en mass and anything to make heroes more like LoL or copy and past things exactly from those game without tweaking them on improving on them is the only acceptable answer even if it could have other bad side effects of the game Stuff like LAN was a pretty major decision at a high level stuff like that wont get reverted without MAJOR support or desire from community Letting a few people bitch about it won t change anything and suppressing complaints about it will only ensure it never gets changed It takes blizzard time to get work done that I can accept The only thing amateur about blizzard I feel about that game is how much they hold themselves back trying to pander to their community a complaint a share across all their titles Blizzard puts out its best when they lock themselves away and ignore all the community feedback telling them how shitty the stuff they are working on is and just make it and make it great anyways Then they put it out and discover we love 90 of what they did even the stuff we thought we would hate but blizzard proves they mostly know better than us and we complain about that last 10 and they eventually fix 5 of that Then sit back and ponder while the community rips and shreds the game apart for that last 5 of imperfection an then they come out and make a sequel a decade later after we have cooled down that has got all that and more stuff we didn t even know we wanted and blizzard puts in all the things people claimed would ruin the game that some of us had been asking for but which the main herd of the community couldn t handle but the community figures out no wait we do actually love that but hey it could still use just a small bit more polish getting us all in a frenzy again because we are all are used to perfection from blizzard
It s always been like this man The circlejerk is forever switching
If you only jerk in one direction it s called a stroke
Stop looking for some kind of consistent opinion consensus in an online community made up of thousands of random individuals Differing and often contradictory opinions are going to upvoted by the people who support them
What you have to realize is that there s 176 000 people subscribed to this subreddit That s a lot of different opinions to be had It s not one collective mind that changes every week You have crybabies on this sub that will upvote anything negative and people like me who almost never downvote things unless they really add nothing to the conversation which can skew that ratio
I ve had the opinion that they don t know how to make competitive map pools for a long long time
I really like your points on alot of topics but honestly the only one map pool i can remember being objectively bad was at the end of HoTS And it was due to map winners of the map making contest Everyone was happy that mapmakers get the spotlight but than hated on maps Blizzard devs made much more well rounded and balanced stuff overall
I d rather have map makers do a pool than blizzard to be honest however At least we wouldn t have weird maps that promote supposably creative play which in practice promote for example on prion allins and cheese Good maps should keep at least the first 3 bases standard and move the interesting stuff into the mid late game thats where I think creative map design can shine in competitive play just look at great maps like King Sejong for examples of that
They did a few times most recently the TL map contest that also was met with a ton of hate
Yeah I think people misunderstand why the hate happened it happened because the maps were voted on and Blizzard chose some maps that did not win and the community liked the ones they voted for a lot
deleted
Why even have the vote then Why does the DevTeam think they know so much about what maps should be on ladder
Well if the Dream Pool and the TL map contest are any signs neither do the community
Dreampool was Blizzard s idea what
Yeah the dream pool was the biggest flop in the history of map pools and it was not Blizzard s fault Fuck all y all D
I guess I was a little hard on him Sorry David we do appreciate these posts a lot It comes from a good place I really think some tweaks some skin packs some new ladder changes and that anti hack could potentially do amazing things for sc just want it as soon as possible lol
They made their timelines clear from the very beginning when they announced it on Blizzcon I wish people would ve paid more attention to that
That s the biggest thing to me people are acting surprised Blizzard stuck to their timeline Why is it surprising we ve known the timeline for months it s nothing new
Do you have any source on that timeline I never remember hearing about any such thing
Which Blizzcon are we talking about
last one
patience is a virtue young grasshoppa
HEY BLIZZARD I just want to say that i absolutely love this game and everything you do with it Except maybe the maps not being as standard as i am used to but that can get learned And continue to do amazing Things with this and other games
Just gonna come out and say it Dayvie you re the man Thank you for having the maturity to see above the unproductive comments and continuing to lead the game in a great direction I want you to be my boss one day Soon if possible
Totally agree with keeping things constructive If we want the game to be better let s keep a calm focus and state specifics and evidence Emotional ranting isn t going to help anything I have always appreciated Blizzard s attention to detail and polish The one thing that has always separated Blizzard from many others is that they don t rush anything out When it gets released you are getting a piece of artwork that probably had countless iterations behind the scenes before it brought about even small changes That s no different with what I imagine is the designing and balancing process of SC2 multiplayer The reason I as I assume many others spend so much time with this game is that I trust Blizzard will eventually get it right They won t give up until they re satisfied and they haven t let me down in retrospect The open communication is something I can t thank this dev team for enough It s just something you rarely see in most games You might get an explanation of the finished patch but to get an insight in between patches doesn t just make me want to give better feedback it makes me want to play more to see what s worth another look I ve been going through the progression of maps during the history of SC2 and it s impressive to see how many various unique factors have already been presented There were a lot of standard maps but plenty that did have some interesting designs that never got their full time in the spotlight It d be nice to see some mapmakers go back and see what used to make maps so much fun to play on and bring some of those ideas back into this new age of maps When I look at maps like King Sejong Station Frost or Overgrowth they were all pretty standard but took ages to grow old They had many amazing games and usually felt fresh compared to other standard maps mostly due to the creative layouts The standard maps we see nowadays don t take long to feel a little lacking compared to the titans we ve had previously However I m impressed with the new original maps that present a specific feature to differentiate them They feel like they belong but I wouldn t mind keeping an eye on what isn t working and maybe make changes mid season if necessary Also don t be afraid to get even crazier in aspects that work Going forth I hope to see the ladder continue to consist of half solid fun standard maps with a unique design and half completely original maps like the ones we see now The balance between experimentation and refinement is what playing SC2 is all about and that should carry over into ladder maps as well As long as each map is balanced enough so that no matchup feels like it has to be vetoed we can find a healthy spectrum between standard and original maps that don t sacrifice solid timeless design
has blizzard ever admitted they were wrong the pros do not like the maps the streamers do not like maps What was unique about maps like whirlwind or frost There weren t anything that stuck out out of those two and they were great and fun to play on
uhhh 1 which maps and 2 which pros
from what I have seen prion central protocol and ulrena are widely considered to be bad maps I haven t heard anyone talk about close spawns on ruins of seras but i would love to hear an argument for how it is good
So because maps are not uniform they re considered bad I ve heard complaints about protocol but that s pretty much it And blizzard addressed protocol saying they re going to polish it up
not sure what you mean by not uniform but playing new maps every season is part of what makes the game fun and the current maps are just not very fun prion is one of the most widely complained about maps because zvz is a total shitshow on it and the gold bases are incredibly strong for zerg in other matchups there are maps that promote different gameplay that are fun and maps that promote different gameplay that are not so fun a map that tries to promote different gameplay by making the 3rd 4th both gold bases is a pretty lazy way of doing so edit I will admit I had fun on prion the first month or so it was out but its stale now
Okay so what are zerg s doing thathe is just insane on that map I ve been playing on it and I love it I m a macro player and it s really really easy to play macro games on it in zvz If that is what you re looking for I can tell you what I do and my thought process through it It all comes down to scouting for a second overlord Even if the opponent does a pool first speed build into a gold the defending hatch first player will be way ahead
I liked the maps Ulrena was heavily criticized early on but people made it work Central protocol have some weird cheese for zerg But I don t know a lot I vetoed since the beginning of the season Prion is cool because it zerg can both become huge or you can easily attack from 2 fronts I know it is zerg favored but not impossible as some people make it
People complain about the maps because Blizzard s internal team has shown an inability to create good maps Not just this year but across the entirety of Starcraft 2 The best maps have all come from community mapmakers yet every once in a while Blizzard forgets that they suck at that particular aspect of their job and decides that quirky is better than good The few moderate successes they have had were when they got out of their own way and put out basic macro maps Antiga Shipyard Entombed Valley Shakuras Plateau that followed general guidelines of map design rather than focusing on one gimmick I scoured through a list of all 1v1 ladder maps in SC2 s history and the best Blizzard maps I found were Antiga Shipyard Akilon Wastes Entombed Valley Shakuras Plateau Metalopolis and I guess Vaani Research Station Compare that to Frost Cloud Kingdom Daybreak Whirlwind Bel shir Vestige Overgrowth Ohana Korhal Compound Coda Foxtrot Labs Polar Night Habitation Station King Sejong Station Terraform Yeonsu Echo etc That s not to say that there aren t flops from the community either but the peaks have almost all been from non Blizzard maps edit On top of general map design there s also the fact that Blizzard puts out ugly looking maps Obviously having doodads all over the place doesn t work but some of the stuff Blizzard has put out looks like they got to the first draft and decided to ship it as is
Can t we just have one map like Overgrowth Having unique maps is fine but I want just one nice simple map where you are free to use whatever strategy you want This isn t a black white issue If people want a standard map what s the harm in allowing one Also I find it strange David Kim describes Orbital Shipyard as a very standard map It has a backdoor natural and a very close and easily defended third on a high ground When I think of Standard maps I think of ones like Cloud Kingdom Daybreak Overgrowth Bel Shir Vestige etc
I don t think any single map such as Coda was to blame for the perceived blandness of mid HotS gameplay I think it had more to do with late HotS having Echo Coda and Expedition Lost being played at the same time All of which fit into the very standard 2 player map layout Three seems like too many for sure but I still think zero is too few
I m not talking about the season 2 2015 but about season 3 when Terraform Moonlight Madness Dash and BridgeHead were added Basically all the series no matter the tournament had Coda or Cactus Valley in them and the same strategies were used that s what generates the issues David Kim is talking about that s what generates the stagnation he doesn t want I do agree with you that the lack of something resembling a standard layout is more or less necessary but keep in mind that by doing that you are also heavily influencing the metagame development What I and many other mapmakers have suggested is to basically force tournament organizers into using more community maps and shy away from using basically any ladder maps by creating a Pro map pool in the same way iCCup used to do that changes rapidly over time you can keep a very interesting ever changing meta but sadly the WCS season get in the way and this is without even mentioning the incredibly strong lobbying pro players do to avoid any kind of non ladder map to ever reaching tournaments
The 4 player maps are rather standard maps If you dont think we have standard maps in the map pool I have no hope for you lol
I ll do my best to continue moving forward without your hope I gave you 4 good examples of what I consider very standard maps Ruins of Seras is pretty standard for a big 4 player map but not truly standard overall like those other I listed Lerilak is definitely not standard since it s got a very open natural with two entrances and spawn orientation makes a huge difference with the rotational symmetry Central Protocol doesn t have any single thing horribly wrong with it but overall is probably the most hated map in the current pool Only Horizontal spawns have a decent third base location watchtowers see too much of the map no ramp into main etc Don t get me wrong none of these maps are extremely unique or anything But I still maintain that none of them are very standard except possibly Ruins of Seras but not everyone likes large 4 player maps
Alternate accounts are a serious problem on bnet forums as well Sometimes its just one guy raising a huge stink with his various accounts being as obnoxious as possible Truly regrettable
Prion is fine Lerilak change is great Orbital Shipyard also great Central Protocol Could be cool map if the back rocks into your main ramp had a tighter choke so you could defend it with less The tile set on Central is a little confusing around the middle of the map
Blizzard your games are AWESOME and LotV is the best game I ve ever had the pleasure of playing It pains me to read that your team might feel discouraged because of a few loud negative voices Thank you for an amazing rts GG
Hey blizz the reason many of us were salty about the no map change is because we have played three of these since the beginning of beta they are almost a year old one of the more popular suggestions is to replace some of these with the new GSL maps Rakshir and Skyshield
As a Starcraft 2 fan right from the beginning I really appreciate how Blizzard is communicating during LotV beta and now after release I was really looking Forward for a fast ladder revamp but to be honest I think waiting for a high quality implementation is worth it I really appreciate that Blizz is giving insights early into new ideas so the community can discuss I really feel sorry for DK and his Team getting so much flak they don t deserve it Thank you Blizz and Keep up the good work
i think the most important part about maps is to have more than 2 spawning locations so that not every game turns into proxy cancer since the opponent knows where you are without doing anything tal darim all day please
My exact comment on the community update of this week Feels good and bad to be right YEA So when Blizzard communicates about the changes and when it s happening You guys all cry like babies See why companies don t like to communicate about their internal work If you want more transparancy STOP crying when a new feature doesn t come out tomorow It won t changes a SINGLE thing Blizzard works hard for us and Sc2 Thank you
try looking at dustin browders tweeter hes openly trying to communicate every day for heroes watch what he has to deal with yeesh
What is the point of community feedback and two way communication if blizzard reads what we re saying and then does what they were going to do anyway
What s wrong with sticking to your guns for a few things that you know the community is wrong about
the fact that the community is not wrong and the map pool is horrible every pro gm says that
I m not debating about specific changes I m just answering your question
How could the community be wrong about what they want I ve always felt like Blizzard feel they know what we enjoy more than we do and given the drastic and frankly quite epic decline in almost every single one of their games shows that they really need to drop this attitude
Because they clearly want to balance the game regardless of the map pool and now is the perfect time to try to do it If they succeed it s going to be better in the long run If they fail there are always going to be standard maps The community does not know everything Remember the dreampool remember the TLMC maps that everyone lauded yet ultimately hated
Some ideas for map make the maps beautiful and aesthetically pleasing to look at i think that s almost more important in some ways You want to just see the loading screen and enjoy the map feel fun to run around on too
But you have to keep in mind that the maps have to be able to run efficiently on all PC s even the ones with the minimum specs This means having as fewer doodads as possible and avoiding things such as water It s kind of hard to accomplish both usually when a community map is picked Blizzard spends a while just clearing out as many doodads as possible
It would be cool if they added a feature in the map editor where you could have different layers of decoration that will only show up depending on the settings the player is playing on I don t think it would be terribly hard to implement and would make it so that you could still have the bustling gorgeous doodad heavy maps for spectating WCS or other major tourneys but it would work for low settings that many people normally play on for performance
Yep I think Nate said something similar recently about how Blizzard generally has to remove doodads to make the maps run more evenly
I was wondering recently if there was a way for Blizzard to tier out maps So like the same map pool but map makers would submit multiple versions of maps high end mid tier low end Blizzard has every player s computer specs based on the graphics settings they use in game so they can just let the people who have nice computers enjoy a beautiful map and then dumbify it for people with microwaves
from what I ve gathered during my time of mapping is that the complaints often aren t from low end PC s but mostly mid to high PC users that start crying the moment fps drops to 59 and aren t willing to lower settings but yeah making sure low end PC s can play too is also a concern
yeah take full advantage of the combined tile set or what was it
Pinion Terraces needs one gold no more to be interesting IMO To create exciting games I d like to see the raised mid map blue mineral bases become golds The two current mid golds in the map don t see much use outside of late game scenarios and could also maybe stay but all this would encourage is expanding to those spots instead of the current gold bases Might see some wacky tactics that way though Risk is a factor because they re easily sieged from the low ground Scouting this spot could decide games if the player expands here very early on Defense might be easier from the ramp side for protoss to also create a safer gold expansion rush should they choose to do so The biggest downside here in changing this map to just blue minerals map wide is it loses all its excitement and kinda becomes drab With this suggested change I think we could see a pretty strong spiritual successor to maps like Habitation Station which created some pretty interesting games in my opinion and all races benefited marginally the same But maybe I m just crazy
Blizzard will never admit that they were wrong rofl It s not the first time they tried to spin it and pin the whole thing on ungrateful and demotivating community
exactly Also its not like LOTV is a new game Its the same game as Blizz released Wings 6 years ago Just has 6 new units like seriously wtf do these people do all day besides feel sorry for themselves
Well besides units they DID fix quite a bit of stuff in LoTV though it took them 6 years which is just bad no matter how you slice it So i kind of agree i guess
Anyone else don t think the map is as bad as people say they are except for Ulrena because fuck that shit
Much of the negative reaction arises from how some critical information in the post was handled Dropping the line we hope to launch the revamped ladder in the second half of the year right in the midst of an otherwise run of the mill community update was extremely ill advised and gave the strong impression that the expectations and priorities of the team are misaligned with those of the community How you guys thought that it wouldn t elicit disappointment and frustration I don t understand A separate post or YT vid similar to what Ben Brode s been doing for Hearthstone that explains the challenges the objectives and the timeframe would not have attracted the same kind of vitriol Not being mean but the controversy is 100 on you guys and the passive aggressive tone in this follow up does nothing for anybody The decision not to update the map pool is still highly questionable even after the detail we ve been offered here Freshening up the ladder every few months should be a basic function of SC2 s management and the developer oriented rationale that balance is easier when the pool is static is frankly not acceptable The customers come first that doesn t mean that you ought to take a scalpel to Prion Terraces based on mob opinion but you can t justify inaction or a controversial decision based on what the developers are comfortable with you have to base that decision on the consumer experience and in this case refusing to cycle in new maps has absolutely no upside for us
Agreed entirely new maps would keep the ladder refreshing Were on the first season of 2016 not years down the line in lotv and yet were forced to play the same somewhat uninteresting maps We dont need radically differentmaps either
This just shows that the community needs to be more positive Standard psychology here Positivity encourages people to work harder Negativity results in lackluster results and poor quality products
I love this new community update you guys are awesome thanks for your criticism I can t understand why you need several months to finally address the leave league bug or need another 6 months to revamp the ladder it makes it look like there are only a few people working on SC2 Wow asshole fuck off we need constructive criticism your negativity is demotivating
In practice removing the gold bases is bad What practice Where have pros played on this map with normal expansions Honestly you could just make one of the golds a normal expansion It s the double gold that s retarded vs zerg The map doesn t have unique strategies you either cheese as terran or protoss vs zerg or you lose
He s saying that their current principle is to have a diverse map pool The only real distinctive factor for that map is really the gold bases removing that makes it a standard map In practice removing the gold bases is bad because they re leaving their principle re map pool
Remove 1 gold and its the only map in the pool with a gold third Still unique and much better to play on
As far as winrate goes I like the map for obvious reasons but If that s all it has going for it then quite frankly it s not that much of a loss
I m actually in favor of the idea of unique different maps that push towards unique strategies The crux is all in what differences we re really going for Mineral heavy armies don t really appeal to me especially when you factor in that the map inherently favors zerg which means zergling heavy compositions Really close rush distances don t really appeal to me ulrena I think that is why they are seeing negative feedback about keeping this map pool That is my problem with the map pool It isn t that the maps are different it is that they are different in a way that isn t fun or appealing Maybe ask the community for ideas on how maps should be different I don t mean specific elements but maybe maps that favor air play Or maps that a really easy third is available for all three races I m not saying it has to be these things specifically I m just giving examples but let s find some unique ideas the community might enjoy
Don t flatter yourselves guys I doubt he s talking about this subs comments because they re toothless compared to ones made by people on the bnet forums Holy shit I went there to get away from the toxicity often present in this sub and that place is way way worse Out of the frying pan into the fire for real
I like map diversity I don t want the same builds on each map If you are rude in your comments you don t deserve to get listened too even if you have a good idea
I take issue with DKim blaming us for his team being demotivated We re the customers who ve purchased this product it is us who this game is for The playerbase is a fraction of what it used to be its because people have become demotivated to buy play this game Is that our fault The onus is on DKim his team to put out a good product that we consumers will buy support The aspersions from the community are directly related to the millions of posts conversations we ve had while seeing little change as a result What does DKim expect That we re all just gonna tell them hey guys good job If his team is that demotivated then perhaps they need to fire the person leading their team put someone in who will motivate them to do their jobs We all understand that it takes time to get things right but at his timeframe at 4 6 9 months from launch how many players will even be left They say time is money well i say DKim the clock is ticking but thanks for the update
It s the way people say things They appreciate the constructive feedback but people have been pretty extreme with how they word things Like your post You don t know anything about how they operate or what they are working on and you re saying somebody should be replaced That s not constructive and quite stupid imo
Its people like you that need to just fuck off
I don t
I like the maps
See how much of fucking pricks you are You guys are disrespectful and mean Who are you to talk shit about people like this The dev team and all of the Starcraft 2 have done so much and yet people only whine and make this community worse I just want to say FUCK YOU because that s how I m feeling You guys are toxic and make people feel bad Good job for demotivating people who are very passionate
ok sorry davie i take it all back your team is huge your team is fully devoted to this game and lotv is fully featured and complete but it still takes 7 months from release for ladder rework
sorry we were dicks after the last community update Thanks for everything you do for starcraft And keep up the community updates they re amazing We love you david kim starcraftteam 3
I wish blizzard would stop thinking every map must be unique I get that you want to have some different maps but not every map Imo people should be able to veto all the special maps So 3 maximum and the rest should be standard so that people can choose whether they like to play them or not And please blizzard stop being stubborn and admit that prion with double gold as your natural third has failed and just chance them to blue bases Not every idea has to be a succes
I think this is because they don t want to balance the game through standard maps and want game balance to stand on its own throughout a variety of maps They have said so before iirc They ve been pushing for a variety of maps since HotS where the community also shut them down and asked for standard maps all the time Blizz must see LotV s new meta as an opportunity to test if they can balance the game without overrelying on maps
It s honestly how Brood War was at first Blizzard didn t do shit to balance that game so you had some whacky fucking maps made in an effort to to balance out win rates between races
I agree with what he said at the very end The way the community is acting is demotivating for the SC2 team and Blizzard in general I agree that some things are taking a little bit too much time Skins for example but people don t seem to see how much Blizzard is investing and supporting SC2 I mean look at this year s prize pool you think a DreamHack or ESL will increase the Prize pool that much Afreeca maybe i m sure that all that support from the money to the way they worked on WCS 2016 and the way they are working with us The community for a better game shows how much Blizzard cares about the game So PLEASE stop being demotivating and discouraging and instead give constructive feedback even if you don t agree with SC2 Team don t just bach on the team and give them solutions and suggestions instead
So what if it is demotivating you abide by customers
tldr everyone shut the fuck up Thank god he said it People are insane on this subreddit recently
Good job guys we triggered Blizzard
Blizzard something I think that isn t brought up enough is the fact that you CANNOT hit liberators with spores OR queens on Orbital Shipyard if they position themselves correctly Please please PLEASE fix this by either removing unnecessary airspace or extending the amount of buildable ground behind the mineral lines on that map
Yeah you can You just can t do it if they get the liberators range Which nathanias popuralized doing after stealing the build from bunny
Yes and it s completely retarded here let me stop you from mining from 2 bases without effort GG
How is this bad I can put a Tempest there too and not get hit Zero effort There is a tech investment in doing that
Yeah its pretty strong I think the only real way to beat it is getting mutas out pretty fast but not commiting to it
On one base it does come out by 6 minutes On 2 bases its more like 7 to 7 30 So 1 they re gambling and hoping the opponent will not walk up and straight up kill them And 2 if the libs do no damage because getting a spire out in time is pretty easy the zerg is super far ahead
The talk about working together is pretty cool though in the old days you bought a game and that was it I hope they could tweak the cyclone and there was a lot of good feedback there to work with
I mean Blizzard gave you what you wanted right Now we have welfare championships so that you can cheer on your little favorite guy with the same skin color as you and feel happy about it fuck the top tier let them stay on their island and play amongst themselves After all we don t want top quality games we just want to cheer for someone who makes us think hey that could be me So why are you guys bitching at the team now
map pool is really stale central protocol really just let us use the GSL maps and no one would care that the ladder update is late or whether skins are in the game
Fuck david kim and his sack of bullshit
I like the maps I like that they keep strong units and interesting maps rather than flattening out the game and giving into whiners
The community had NO say in the development of SC and BW they helped the competitive scene stay alive and thrive but you want development power and say look at BW when the community had even less say then Also don t say give us tools over and over and then not say what tools you want
No anger at all just sadness by ignorance Blizzard does most of those things which is sad the community ignores them or hates them in the case of the last TL map contest which had some great cash prizes
I m not at all ignoring the map making community I mean honestly my entire point is that we need to work even harder for map making It should be monthly not seasonally And we should be collecting way more maps from the community and including them in the map pool
I don t know why he tried to deny the fact that SC2 multiplayer development team is small If it s not small it s absurdly incompetent The new ladder for example first they said it was coming with LotV then in early 2016 now it s second half of the year I doubt there are more than 10 people going to work every day to try and make SC2 a better game Not buying this have pity on us we are doing our best talk
Can you provide a link where they said it s coming with LotVOne of the best SC2 players of all time really hope it doesn t end like this
NotLikeThis
Thanks poppy
I ve always hated that scene
it s cool he just blazed some weed man
Well depending on how this turns out it may end any discussion about him being the GOAT
If this is true it s a fucking enormous blow to Life s reputation and the game itself Titles and even prize money might be forfeit but if you ve seen his earlier play he s still the greatest Zerg to play WoL and HotS Savior s name is now mud but he s still a bonjwa
Yeah GOATs sometimes get covered in shit but they re still GOATs
The thing is Saviour is most known for his match fixing even more than his period of dominance This could destroy his legacy
Darn you re sharp
sure but it just doesn t have the same ring to it anymore you re the champ but and there s the huge BUT It s the difference between fans madly running up to you for an autograph and a fan or two recognizing you slapping on the back and saying you know i still believe in you
If the best player to have played the game gets caught for match giving I might give up on starcraft
mvp never matchfixed tho
Life was the only player who wasn t Mvp to get me as excited as he would I really really hope it doesn t end like this
MVP was the boss Even more boss than the boss toss
Had an appropriate name too
Another top tier Zerg player getting caught with math fixing It s Savior all over again
I am slightly ignorant but Savior was before Jaedong became the best zerg right So Savior was just like Life more or less the greatest zerg
Yeah Savior became the best by creating a new way to play zvt Jaedong became the best by refining the savior style to the extreme He also innovated a bit 2 hatch muta but nowhere near as profoundly savior
Already happened once starcraft will survive somehow
It will survive in an even more crippled form Kespa never really recovered from the match fixing scandal and never attained such heights ever again If this is true it will definitely accelerate the decline of the scene It s not like current young korean gamers are flocking to starcraft and applying to play on Kespa teams It s all about the MOBA s in korea right now
Apollo has been right all along all Koreans need to be banned now from western events
Build a wall and make Korea pay for it
Dark Templar Trump
If life s wins are nulled does that imply that Mvp would be the only 5 times GSL champion in existence Wouldn t that also imply that MMA won Blizzcon
Usually erasing someone s win doesn t mean that the runner up wins There s just no winner
MBC OGN went as far as to erase the existence of the MSL OSLs savior won as if they never happened at all
Well I don t think there d be any reason to null Life s wins If he s accused of match fixing it means he threw games on purpose he didn t cheat in order to win
I think the idea is to discourage match fixing Good players will be less inclined to do it if their legacy is at risk Seems like punitive legal action would be enough but idk
To those who skipped reading the comment sections in TL According to EJ when it said neither KT or Afreeca were aware of this it meant that neither teams are aware of any incident that lead to the arrest
Is it possible this is entirely unrelated to SC2 Dude just got caught stealing or a DUI or something
We don t know what he was accused of so yes it is possible
From TL The point is the location of prosecutor s office Changwon office All korean e sports matches are played in Seoul because influence of Seoul as capital is absolute like Paris But Life is interrogated in Changwon not Seoul Changwon is quite far from Seoul It is far more than 400km 250 miles But Changwon is quitecclose from Life s hometown But most interesting thing is Changwon prosecutor s office is specialized in investigating Match Fixing Most Sports soccer baseball basketball volleyball starcraft Match fixing investigation have done in Changwon That s why korean fans are suspecting Life s Match fixing
This makes me sad Although without a conviction I m not jumping to conclusions
on the bright side we got called a sport like basketball baseball volleyball soccer
yeah by a guy on a starcraft message board
Sure I understand that I get that what this is most likely about But still until we know officially what is going on we can t know for sure
Please just be a drunken monkey incident like Stephano
On the other hand hearing about Life going down Fruitdealer s path with drinking would be similarly sad
Fruiddealer has had a drinking problem
At least had At the time when his fame slowly shrinked
it s only a drinking problem if you have no money
Tell that to my liver
That s silly of course your liver doesn t have money
But then everyone looked at the picture with Stephano sporting the Raybans being escorted away and looked upon him as a rockstar
Rockstar Stephano was awesome 1 zerg imo
Let s hope
He s getting prosecuted for raping a frenchman last year
Really Source I d read more about this Edit OH I GET IT I GET IT I GET IT NOW
Not his first offense He was caught on camera in 2012 https www youtube com watch v tNSfQ1wPZbU
But Stephano won that game
Shhhh it s the best I could do on short notice We ll call that attempted rape okay
It happend at blizzcon the poor frenchy was the last foreign hope LILBOW

I love that it starts with May contain content inappropriate for children
Ayy
I feel the need to point out if there was any sort of certainty that he was arrested on matchfixing issues KesPA would have cancelled his game not pushed it back So no one really knows enough to say anything at this point
Which means he would have been brought in because of information that was given up in the ongoing prime investigation
Hmm this is pure speculation but I can imagine that KT somehow got an info about this incident and tried to not have their company name connected to this I can also imagine that those huge companies have some kind of influence on local authorities to delay the investigation process However the whole story is sad and I hope this accusation turns out to be false
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE
BRING BALANCE TO STARCRAFT NOT LEAVE IT IN DARKNESS
From my point of view the non matchfixers are evil
WELL THAN YOU ARE LOST
I HATE YOU
YOU WERE LIKE A FOREIGNER TO ME I LOVED YOU
I HAVE FAILED U LIFE I HAVE FAILED U
I HATE SAND
IT GETS EVERYWHERE
just like life s lings
Too soon

Life paid Lilbow to throw his Blizzcon match Kappa
made my day
what should I say on the interview Lilbow Tell them youre practicing for lotv Life
That would be the best worst news for the entire scene
To be honest I think that Lilbow would actually get less shit for that lol
But the fact that he accepted the matchfix would be even more controversial and could end his career
He threw the game either way At least he would have made some money from it
Considering his chances against Life I wouldnt really fault him for that
Life tried to throw hard but Lolbow was worse than expected
Do Koreans bet on transferes
Pretty good question Especially considering he requested a trade
Out of all the things to bet on that would probably be the worst Way too easy to get inside information prior to something being announced Even for real sports in Europe where you can bet on anything I think that s pretty rare
well considering that kespa put away game timers to prevent some sort of bets I wouldn t be surprised if that would be a thing
Don t worry guys Life will find a way
Life ALWAYS finds a way
Does anyone have vision over there We could pop a Nydus in his room to get him out I really hope he didn t do anything wrong
Not enough vespene gas WE NEED MORE VESPENE GAS
I hope Life is just drunk too much to celebrate his trade and destroy some glass or something
It s Korea you don t get arrested for public intoxication If you did half the country would be locked up
I doubt Life actually threw any games but that s not the only thing he could be in trouble for Here s my guess on what Life may have done emphasis on guess and on may have Remember when SPL started hiding the game timer in their broadcasts The stated reason was because betting sites were commonly taking bets on specific things such as Will player X make a third nexus before Y minute mark It s possible that Life took money to do or not do specific strategies So even if Life never threw a game it s possible that he took money while thinking Well I was planning to make 16 zerglings before the 6min mark anyway He may have been called for interrogation about circumstantial evidence regarding bets placed on his match
That doesn t even seem evil
It s not as bad as match fixing but people are still losing money
Relax guys it s probably nothing Remember innocent until proven guilty
It s probably something But it is definitely innocent before proven guilty
The ominous arrest dont help it at all definitely something
The tweet said that Korean for arrest and in custody for investigation is the same word
Yea but it comes off as ZerGJunO being rather hopeful is arrest
Yea but official kespa statement isnt too positive eith its wording and bit defensive no Maybe its how they word all these things but im bit worried
All Kespa are doing is making sure someone under investigation for match fixing isn t playing Doesn t seem negative at all That said with the way the tweet puts it is this actually arrested or more like a call in for questioning Lastly innocent until proven guilty
General attitude in korean forum and reaction there seems to be in full panic mode similar to reaction here Hopefully its just nothing but oh man
Just hope the prosecutor they are talking about is not Miles Edgeworth
HOLD IT
sigh Wright I really hope this is better than your usual tricks
Ehm well you see haha

Skimming r all must be some onion article wait what
Just in case you need more context Life is a professional Starcraft 2 player one of the best of all time There has been suspicion of matchfixing illegal betting activity within the scene for some time Late last year the owner of a team as well as a few of his players were arrested in a matchfixing sting The players and coach were mostly fringe players and there had been some evidence which had been hotly debated as to whether it was evidence at all that those players had been matchfixing for some time so although it was a blow to the scene people mostly had been ready expecting something to happen In addition I think people hoped that that was the end of matchfixing in Starcraft 2 and that the SC2 scene could move on This arrest of one of the best players of all time who is very popular came out of nowhere so it s a huge shock Like if this player is matchfixing it feels like anyone could be I think there s also a lot of angst because the Starcraft 2 professional scene has shrunk in the past few years A scandal like this definitely wouldn t help the scene ETA I should add I believe a big part of the reason they re being arrested is that matchfixing in South Korea where this is taking place is conducted by illegal gambling rings so the arrests occur more because of that than say one person betting on himself to lose a game or anything This part of my knowledge of this whole thing is the most murky so someone else might be able to explain better
If Parting is making a 100k salary Life must be making the same or probably more
One of the best Starcraft players Terrible day
Don t talk about it as if he s already been confirmed to be match fixing time will tell Though this is a bad omen so to speak
Life is the 2nd most successful starcraft 2 player of all time
Arguably first He seems to be less meta dependent than Mvp ever was and has been successful over a longer period of time at this point He s also won more money I believe and probs had more influence on the meta
well if you go by prize money life is second to MC by a very thin margin
Not if you include the bonuses he gets from the match fixers
Don t rush to condemn him just yet but I am also surprised as shit by this news
Maybe he just killed a person is all
The trade between Afreeca and kt was done by Life s own request and they confirmed that neither of KT and Afeeca were aware of this WTF I really don t understand anything
Clunky translation just means they were unaware of the circumstances surrounding Life when they trade went through Trade was arranged by the teams at Life s request Basically trying to make it clear the trade has nothing to do with the arrest present situation
Think it meant more as neither team didn t know about arrest situation when they traded and that life requested transfer himself
Your point makes sense Google trad In addition to Lee Seung Hyun is the trade association has been made to your requests KT master roll African Prix team and the team is not hayeoteum not aware of this issue and confirmed the previous trading teams through the Secretariat We prefer not to generate a third of the damage such as through improper speculation and disseminate unverified facts relating to this trade
Eg clarified in the tl thread now that I read it and my korean is bit fuzzy right now Have to sleep Will see how this developes tomorrow but life IS confirmed arrested for some reason Its not questioning or anything He is arrested Doesnt look good at all
From TL The point is the location of prosecutor s office Changwon office All korean e sports matches are played in Seoul because influence of Seoul as capital is absolute like Paris But Life is interrogated in Changwon not Seoul Changwon is quite far from Seoul It is far more than 400km 250 miles But Changwon is quitecclose from Life s hometown But most interesting thing is Changwon prosecutor s office is specialized in investigating Match Fixing Most Sports soccer baseball basketball volleyball starcraft Match fixing investigation have done in Changwon That s why korean fans are suspecting Life s Match fixing
that awkward moment when life takes the son of savior nickname too seriously
Rip boys Why would life need to matchfix though He shouldn t be desperate for any cash o O I m going to give life the benefit of the doubt on this case
Or he was aware of matchfixing in which somebody threw against him
But he is arrested not brought in for questioning
Apparently the same word in Korean so I ve heard
Ive only really heard it in context with actual arrest though
No this is wrong information The article in Korean clearly states it was an arrest
so there s a possibility of life in prison
You clever bastard
I hope he is innocent because if he isn t Jesus That s a big hit to SC2 s credibility to have one of it s most illustrious members engaged in match fixing
Have we officially found our sAviOr
Save this official for now
too soon
I didn t think things could get worse for SC2 in Korea I was wrong
Starcraft is turning out to be similar to russian history and then it got worse
Can t win a land war on Aiur in winter
And CSGO fans complaining about their match fixers not getting unbanned
nooooooooooo
Don t forget guys life always finds the way
Wasn t he one of the people that YoDa threw matches against Maybe this doesn t really have much to do with him
He won vs YoDa 2 0 in code s last year He also won in Proleague vs BBoongBBoong
But I don t think Life winning vs Yoda would been an upset So I doubt people would have bet against him
Life is just a kid isn t he Teenager
he is 19 years old 20 in korea
I enjoy betting Starcraft pretty much every match available Life has had some very suspicious matches based on odds movements I created a thread 6 months ago with my suspicion Obviously this proves nothing but it has happened on more than one occasion for Life https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3cspvv life match fixing
did you remove the thread or mods did
yaa wtf
wow good call
let s hope he did something like being too drunk and disturb people in the public or anything of that sort We can t withstand another blow to the scene
It s Korea you don t get arrested for public intoxication If you did half the country would be locked up
Allright allmighty reddit anyone remembers any shady game from Life Winning or Losing Most likely SPL or SSL
Life always had a reputation for doing much worse in Proleague than individual tournaments I can t think of any MKP like behaviour though

Please be like a drug bust or thievery Don t be because of match fixing Esports doesn t need this
can somebody please find Ja Rule so I can make sense of all this
This would be fucking insane Please no Life please no So far as the post says it s not conclusive at all so I really hope he hasn t participated in any match fixing After Mvp it took me awhile to find a favorite player and until now Life was that player He was the only reason I got the KTRolster flair and if he is found innocent will be the only reason I get an Afreeca Freecs flair So shit I guess just hope he hasn t done anything wrong for now and wait and see
I keep hiding this subreddit and it keeps showing up anyway I might just kill myself
I feel you bro
Holy shit This would be an absolutely devastating loss to the scene if this ends up going the way of Yoda and Prime I just don t understand why Life would ever match fix not saying he did but just speculating It s not like he is hurting for money Surely his career can t end like this
Came here from r all can someone give me some context
one of the best and most successful Starcraft 2 players in history has been arrested in Korea Apparently he could be under a match fixing accusation but that is absolutely not for certain just a rumour Starcraft history has been shaken by a huge match fixing scandal in the past so SC fans are very worried this could occur again It is probably unlikely that we ll have more detalied information soon because it is very late in Korea as far as I now so speculation is getting pretty out of hand
to go in deeper than u ilsegugio The scandal that 1st hit the SC scene was in 2010 iirc it was a VERY organized match fixing rink There was this player saviOr Ma Jae Yoon that served as a middle man in between the match fixing brokers and other players something like this but change head coach for a player
Rumors fly in he got caught sleeping with a minor and had illegal substance of some kind
https twitter com ZerGJunO status 693060949436071936 ref src twsrc 5Etfw This seems reassuring that it is probably just a misunderstanding
what do you think arrest means in english
I don t know much about it and what the difference is but I assume that most people look at arrest as more caught in the actual act of doing something illegal whereas put in custody for questioning there is a chance there could be a misunderstanding
Yes arrest means there was an arrest order which is issued when substantial evidence is found where as when youre put into custody its for questioning and its not an official arrest
No he is wrong There is a clear difference between the word arrest and investigation and the Korean article uses the word arrest You would NOT use for mere investigation Yes his guilt is not proven but he is not there as a witness or something loke that
Life was paid off by the Korean mob to throw games by cheesing Unfortunately he was so good he still won
Jesus I haven t paid any real attention to Starcraft 2 for a long time now but I remember back when I was madly into the eSports scene seeing this new kid come out of nowhere and start destroying people I remember passionate discussions arguments and competitions with friends over this kid and his opponents This really isn t cool though I hope he didn t do it and is found innocent but if he did then I cannot feel sorry for him There is a big scandal going on in Counterstrike at the moment a team of players Ibuypower who were caught match fixing and subsequently dropped as a team and banned from all tournaments that Valve had any say in For some reason a lot of people want them to be unbanned but I really cannot see the logic in that I don t care how good a player they are I don t care if they have a sob story behind them Match fixing when money is on the line and it is definitely on the line in eSports is unforgivable I mean just look at what is happening here this person has been taken into custody pending investigation and may face criminal charges for this the ones who were banned by Valve got off easy
I am so damn frightened
So will he be allowed to play his match against Bunny in GSL Code A
Lmao I have a bet riding on that match Threw 20 down online for Life
Prosecutor Come on even without practice there s no way Lilbow fell for three fucking 6 pools in a row s
I just want to cry not you Life
it all makes sense now Lilbow was paid off to lose to Life in blizzcon
I don t believe a word of it Lilbow wouldn t do that to his fans
Savior all over again BibleThump
Let s all remember what happened to MKP Let s not have that happen again Give the kid space and wait til everything gets figured outLike I get this blog applies to the recent drama about WCS and personalities throwing shit at each other But Life s case I don t think people are being over negative there I didn t see anyone jumping into conclusions all I see is people wishing please let not be matchfixing I don t think any of those comments are damaging Life s rep or the scene Do those comments count as being negative Does especulation count as being negative TLDR I understand we must be positive but how this applies to the news regarding Life Am I missing threads posts where people already assume he matchfixed and or our scene is ruined
Maybe he posted in a more preventative manner There s no doubt things COULD go downhill fast with regards to the situation and it seems like a decent enough time to make the post
I missed this comment before but yes exactly what you said thanks I thought I was clearly transmitting that sentiment but I suppose not
bassically hes throwing crap in his cut the crap blog post lawl
Hey I think you re mostly right but as much as Life being innocent is a strong possible outcome the opposite is as well I mentioned precedent in the write up because I think that if Life ends up being guilty that could unleash a shitstorm and I d like us to be more ready for it
Every time I take a shit I get anxious about the strong possibility of clogging the toilet so pretty much every time I take an empty roll or even push it out of the TP fold it so that it is sharp enough to cut the shit into sections Usually I can get two slices in before the structural integrity of the roll gives out and I finally have go for the flush
what in the fucking what
Let s cut the crap
Also literally shitposting
quit playin with scissors and shit and cut the crap I don t have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know its a rap

If you consistently worry that much about it why not buy one of those blades you can use to cut up jams and have that whole load be lifted from your shoulders and mind
Where would i put it And I m not going to wash a blade every time I take a shit
I assume it d come with a holder And you wipe your bum so wipe your blade
I wasn t expected that to be the top comment

wow
cool
I think you should lay off the jam
I love you Catz Keep the faith This is our game not kespas spotv afreeka or even blizzards THIS GAME BELONGS TO THOSE THAT PLAY FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME not for any other reason All the recent drama in the scene hasn t affected my games one bit I love this game till I die
Positivity on the front page or r starcraft Am I in a parallel universe or something Thanks CatZ
Well what do you think about the rest of the article of which life was just a small part of
Thanks for clarifying I think you get the idea of what I was saying regardless if you want to suggest a better word for next time i ll honestly keep it in mind
I ve always been partial to crucified in the court of public opinion
vilified crucified daemonized
you think those are all better fits perhaps vilified crucified and daemonized sound a bit harsher than what I was meaning to imply
Well I just gave three because I didn t know what you meant to imply What I thought you meant to imply was that he was slandered as in legally so
I guess I ment to say his reputation was tarnished
Hey Catz made a video in response to your article https www youtube com watch v kLvpycNFVgo feature youtu be I strongly disagree that we shouldn t be negative about this situation
I watched it s cool man I m not saying you shouldn t be sad not talk about it or get over it over night those are all valid feelings and it s awesome that you re as passionate as you are for this game I am too Maybe not quite AS passionate as you seem but I certainly love StarCraft just like you do I owe my Lifestyle to this game I ve met most of my best friends through this game All I m asking is for people to be more positive and stop predicting doomsday what purpose does that serve in this context I m saying comments like If Life is banned StarCraft is 100 dead serve absolutely no purpose I think that people who think the scene is dead should at least stick by their word and leave You can grief your favorite player bud that s cool no that s Awesome I m just saying also celebrate what s left over and try not to scare people away I m not saying pretend like nothing happened I m saying maybe consider upvoting to 1400 some of the things that we still got going for us and are to come
Hey man thanks for your response I totally agree with you after re reading your article 5 10 times and after cooling off I get your message and you are right This community is perpetually negative in the worst of ways I myself am a content creator I make videos on how to improve etc I will continue to do so and I will continue to do my best to grow the scene and always be a positive force Tonight I was defeated for the first time in awhile when it came to starcraft I felt pretty broken I overreacted and was a lesson learned Thanks for the mature response I spoke strongly and knew the repercussions of my words and was prepared for really negative outlash You ve surprised me in the best of ways Catz keep up the good fight Risk
Hey man your words about Life moved me From the first game I have seen him back when he was just seen as a young talented player I have been in love with how he plays the X factor that he has that cannot be put into words sometimes So thank you for making this video However I will put off having my heart broken until I know some more facts Honestly I cannot imagine Maybe I am in denial as well
When I started watching I thought wtf that s the wrong time for making ironic stupid jokes No I completely agree This is the wrong case to ask for positivity For me though it doesn t really takes anything away from starcraft itself so I don t even know why to talk about what s great about the game It would be horrible if Life is convicted for me personally and many others because we are fans and for him obviously But if so it s only a good thing because it would show that it is possible to get even the biggest name in Korean starcraft if they do matchfixing It would obviously be a shock to the scene but I don t think that it would kill it or even near to that And I honestly think that there was and probably is more going on in Korean starcraft scene Money is big people are young and dumb would be surprized if there isn t more But anyway in Life s case nothing is really known now except he was arrested which horrible on it s own and the rest are rumors horrible rumors
So many people missed the main point of this article It s not about Life s situation It s about the fact that you can t read comments in any starcraft related discussion without being bombarded by negativity I love this game and LOTV is the most fun I ve had with sc2 but I had to take alost a month off from the game purely because the community made it not fun The game didn t do that Blizzard didn t do that This community that can t be happy about anything did that I want to thank my Catz for trying to bring this to attention affect change It s nice to see somebody in the scene trying to help
Hey thanks that means a lot to me to read I really thought I was ready to at least give it a shot but man do I feel defeated and just out of place
Hey thanks for the reply Dont let the negativity drag you down I enjoyed the last event you put on and I ll watch this one too if you go through with it
I will too
Nobody knows anything at all yet and people are already writing articles
The thing is that if there s anything to know about r starcraft is that things will get rowdy regardless of what happens Might as well give you all a heads up Tbh the fact that CatZ feels like he has to do this speaks a lot about the scene
Really I didn t see that at all
to get attention same shit happens every time
This article isn t really about life it more about our ouook on the game and what not The life part was only small part of it
I don t always agree with Catz but we should all appreciate having him in our community I like what catz is saying here and I really hope people lighten the fuck up
I love the game and the people that make it great But the shit talking and whining that comes out of this community this sub in particular is incredible It s ceaseless We shit on people who seek knowledge and want to be positive about the game We isolate and demoralize people who want to get better at the game Do we think that by continually comparing Starcraft 2 to something else be that Brood War LoL etc that it will get better make more money or be more accepted in mainstream gaming It s like being married and continually complaining to your wife and kids about how hot your best friend s wife is It s asinine I don t care how big Starcraft is Obviously I don t want to see it go away but rather continue to be supported by this same intelligent and determined community I ve given money to streamers backed tournaments watched hundreds of hours of everything from online cups between two golds duking it out to Blizzcon and GSL Code S finals I figuratively dragged five people over to watch SOS and Life in December two people they d never heard of playing a game they d never played or particularly cared about We ll see what happens with Life This really sucks But to the best of my knowledge he s still on for next Friday If he s guilty I hope we re able to learn from what happened and move forward Actually I hope we ll be able to do that either way I agree with you Catz This should set a precedent And for his sake I hope he learns something too whatever happens He s not even 20 don t forget I say we all step back for a moment take a deep breath and chill out maybe play some 4v4 monobattles Nobody s ever going to win these arguments We re an online community it s impossible Moreover we re a smart online community playing a smart game and we all have very nuanced and very strong opinions on how it should be
I m glad CatZ wrote this This type of dialogue should be way more common place Community figures in my opinion are supposed to be doing this shit way more We re not here to just suck up views and Jerk each other off on Twitter We are supposed to actively participate in community discussions not stand by and watch the circle jerkers cannibalize the community
Yet you come to jerk CatZ off via Reddit I get your point though Are you considering discussing the SC2 dev teams recent feedback on your next show Seems important now that they are revealing how the community effects them
This is the positive type of jerk though so it s ok
Yeah that s what I meant
he says as my pants remain dry
Well you could consider that English isn t his main language and so he may have been accidentally messed up there Also just because your unhappy doesn t mean you have to be doom and gloom you could be critical but constructive which is more what his article was saying and 9 11 comparison wasn t bad
lol unbelievable What a garbage post You didn t offer anything constructive with this response
FeelsGoodMan
I really dont see the point of anything he said This was such a crowd pleasing karma whoring walking the median dont say anything polarizing article of nothing I didnt take anything at all from this what he is actually saying He is saying that this life thing is the best precedent against match fixing since savior Okay cool last month a entire team was caught matching fixing bw in korea during saviors time was bigger than sc2 will ever be and still match fixing continued cool match mixing is bad and we have a couple new examples really great insight The best player of the past 3 years just got arrested for possible match fixing He wrote a couple paragraphs weakly trying to get a sliver lining out of it Its bad news period Not much else to take from that is he saying to stop with this feelsbadman mentality thats cool weve been saying this since proxy 2 rax got marineking into a finals everyone knows negativity around a game is bad what are you acutally saying Maybe we have a negative attitude because every news article is negative WCS blows player size in sc2 is dying teams players are match fixing the ones who arent are struggling proleague is like half what it used to be so many teams espeically the bigger foreign teams are dying TL is basically the only real functioning pro foreign team right now Besides the release of lotv what has been profoundly positive in the past 6 months we cant even get on the mainstage of dreamhack the fucking tournament sc2 built up no i dont consider one BO7 at 11 am anything significant sc2 is in a real fucking hard spot atm possibly the worst its ever been and thats saying alot because a really awesome expansion just got released and were still declining And please for for the love of god can we stop with this our game is the most demanding highest ceiling jerk me off cause i play this game nonsense Creating carved egg shell art is really hard too does anyone give a fuck about that or vault it to the top of any architect hierarchy This game is beautiful because of so many different things aside from its hard Its actually an insult if that is the one singular aspect of starcraft that we continually trot out there for the community to feel good about itself The negativity is a real thing and we act like adolescences when we try to avoid it and act like its not real sc2 is going to need some serious help to survive The community headfigures of this game are pretty fucking awful i have to say There is no real consistency in any of them what so ever and the ones that do have consistency frankly are not interesting at all Who makes a living streaming producing content off sc2 No one besides fuck head protech or some other people hovering around 200 600 viewers Every other major game has consistent figure heads people can routinely tune into and get attached to Polts stream was just getting consistent that ended God knows where day 9 incontrol destiny huk nony have gone They pop up every now and then then go off for weeks months at a time Honest to god nathanias and avilo are the best most professional consistent streamer in sc2 right now Thats embarassing The europeans are no where to be found TLO snute mana bunny naniwa morrow all stream when they feel like it with no prolonged consistent schedule for people to tune into The koreans definitely never stream Who are the figure heads that guide maintain and grow this community They were there in the beginning and 100 aided the growth of the good ol days Husky day9 HD JP psy DJ wheat incontrol are basically all gone And god knows i love tastosis but they currently are the anti growth for a community They wield so much currency in this scene and refuse to do anything with it besides cast in korea and the occasional preview article Im not mad at these people for making the choices they did its completely their prerogative and decision but we as a community have to realize that we arent replacing these people with anyone capable of replication and are suffering because of it
CATZ I believe the silent majority greatly appreciate all you have done for the SC2 scene We are so much better off for having you Those of us that would say so are often drowned out in the general negatively Keep on being awesome
Well I hope he didn t mean to insult you root because that would be dumb and I d be eternally sad if you left the scene
Yikes Paragraphs dude
Sorry never been too good at those
hes saying cut the crap because I ve brought plenty of my own
My god you re an idiot Please leave the scene if you feel the community sucks so bad and this game has no future You really make this place great
Guy should be an example for everyone in and out of SC2 This is the attitude that gets things right reserves judgement gives benefit to doubt and upholds his position within the ranks of the grand machine This is a rarity to witness well done
love the last paragraph good job catz
This is a really well written post and I recommend everyone who sees this to read it Thank you CatZ Long live SC2
He has to include the memes otherwise like 95 of r sc2 won t read it
deleted
I meant the first sentence of what I quoted We re diving into a new game imo much more fun and interesting than WoL or HotS
Let s cut the crap And let me plug my product
Agree Please read this D
I cannot for the life of me understand the negativity coming into this thread It is absolutely mindboggling
I agree people are can be stupid
I d just like to throw in a note of calm here It s no secret that the sc2 scene was unsustainable and always was This restructuring was in inevitable after kespa joined in It s not very pleasant but its a positive change to keep sc2 going in a manageable form And keep in mind also that many of these retirements from kespa guys would be happening anyway at their age within military service coming up and so forth The only thing that can actually kill off the game as an esport is negativity from the community leading to further depressed interest so lets not do that alright Lets see what we have on the other side of this time of change accept it and enjoy what the future brings
hey guys lets cut the crap I ll lead by example and make an entire post were I stir up more crap for my personal benefit
Hell ya I love the game and it sucks to see the community cannibalize itself and the game with it
I honestly think you project the negativity just like everyone else The absolute majority of this reddit is positive You choose what you want to read and remember
It s really nice to see these kind of threads from people like Catz I really appreciate what he s doing about our scene since day one The sad part is that not many public figures like him are taking part on pushing the negativity off I can understand that many of us have the perception that we shouldn t take this subreddit that seriously BUT we could at least try to create a good communication channel with Blizzard I don t know which medium would be the best for that A new website only for this purpose where people of our community and public figures discuss and promote our game Maybe I m mentioning this because I truly believe that the moderation of this subreddit is not the best The moderators can also help from their side especially when we have threads like psione s which to me is obvious that he s trying to bring the attention where it supposed to be The game Instead you can still read a good amount of retarded comments that are completely irrelevant with the topic I felt really bad that all these idiots actually made David Kim answer about his development team Believe me I ve been on this industry software development for years and I can understand the challenges problems that such a team is facing especially for a huge product like StarCraft something of course that many people can t comprehend including pros casters It would be great if we had more people like Catz especially from the pros casters side that instead of doing A that is ignoring this subreddit because it can be toxic which is true you can do B start getting involved especially now with this current situation Now I know that many of these public figures feel like I ve been doing things for SC since day 1 and that s all true but you can please offer your help knowledge and take part on this You can always do B We love the game and we feel frustrated as well with this situation
For me if this wasn t Life I wouldn t be so nervous but we are talking about the Michael Jordan of our Export If he is caught the entire game is in serious trouble If we re talking about the game seven of Blizzcon we would be talking about the biggest controversy in the history of ESports the only equivalent would be the 1919 black Sox
But it also sets a much needed STRONG precedent for years to come that the presumed behavior won t be tolerated for anyone and that is cause for celebration Life being accused of match fixing whether guilty or not is not a cause for celebration We already know it won t be tolerated look no further than savior The only thing that s happened here is a famous player has been accused of match fixing Obviously lots of people would be upset if he were guilty and if he were innocent people would quickly forget it So not even counting whatever slander arises in the interim there is no positive outcome I mean this isn t 9 11 I can t help anyone All I can do is think well this sucks hopefully it s not true If people feel negatively because their favorite player might be a criminal who are you to say nah man celebrate The only way to cut the crap is to stop talking about this before any facts have been revealed
You can donate money to patreon account to and there by help people in the scene
I love you Catz this is so well written and like you pointed towards it made me think about how people seem to have this intrinsic ability for problemsolving in the midst of hard situations SC2 is really worth fighting for cause in my opinion it is the most beautiful complex game
This is not only well said but exactly what we NEED to hear Puts things in perspective Gives us a dose of truth bombs and will hopefully help us all improve our attitudes from here on out Thanks Catz
I told em on twitter and I will say it here I appreciate Catz trying to be a positive figure for the scene There is no reason to hate the game you play It is self defeating and stagnates any potential for growth
Why is it that the people banging the drum for relentless positivity have all previously run crowdfunding projects Coincidence
Because negative people complaining all the time don t do shit except whining Saying dedgaem for years has not helped one single bit Shitting on people who try to keep the scene alive will probably not help either
catz iz right we gotta stay positive as a community please ffs I dont want to be the emo kids of esports i already did that in HS and it sucked
I think the pessimism stems from how big Starcraft used to be in the past and how the present isn t living up to it Couple that with the fact that MOBAs and CSGO are pretty dominant in the currrent eSports scene and you get this overwhelming negativity Of course Life s arrest didn t help
deleted
SC2 is never 100 screwed If Life gets banned SC2 will still exist We will still have a WCS and we ll get great games to watch and I hope to be there at Blizzcon or the WCS finals because it s always exciting to be there Hopefully he isn t done because I love to see him play
you think Blizzard is going to issue a recall and confiscate your copy of the game because Life broke the law
Opinions like yours are the whole reason I wrote this if that is truly how you feel if that is really what you believe I honestly hope that if Life gets banned you stick to your thoughts and stop following SC2 I think that if we are to welcome new people in we have to stop being overly negative and toxic I don t see how sc2 can ever grow with this type of mindset but I honestly believe that there is plenty of room for growth because it is the best most challenging game out there
People who conflate the esports scene with SC2 s health as a game are why SC2 s esports scene is in dire shape People care about games they play And few people play games because of its esports scene People play games they like to play If SC2 is a fun game it ll have a user base and by virtue of that an esports scene whatever personalities are on it If SC2 sucks as a game there is no esports personality that ll save it
If Life is being accused of matchfixing I only see two possibilities 1 it happened in 2010 11 before he got famous 2 he was somehow forced to it by threats I can t understand how someone who makes 100k a year could benefit enough from matchfixing sc2 games to do it from free will Even if someone that popular didn t care about getting defamed it wouldn t even make financial sense since any chance of getting caught would mean end of the career If it s 1 I m personally inclined to forgive it He d get banned for sure but I m not going to become hater if he was pulled into it as that young And I have no idea if 2 actually is a something that ever happens outside movies but it makes more sense than him throwing games in hopes of gains like 1 5k in years 2012 15
it could also be he knew about something and just kept his mouth shut since most people don t wana touch that with a 10 foot pole
Life is a gambler as well that s no secret I m not saying that he did anything wrong I m pointing out there are likely more than 2 scenarios possibilities as you seem to believe for which any person in the world especially someone you don t personally know could feel driven to do wrong
Yeah I had hard time believing he could have motive to do it on himself throwing own matches But certainly he could be anything even on organizing side Wish they just came up with more precise statement before rumors spread too much
Calling everyone a hacker in game and generally acting like an asshole online ProTech is such a nice guy indeed
Maybe you should check out his YouTube channel he analyzes replays and breaks them down and calls out cheaters etc Let s cut the crap the community is a joke and he is one of the few to make a stand

Do you even know what a prosecutor s job is Protip you don t get investigated by them if you break some shit in a bar
i love how he still thinks his opinion is relevant
It has a descent mount of upvotes so I would say he Does have a relevant opinion
that doesnt mean shit especially on sc subreddit
I love how you act like your opinion is relevantIt s only an issue with presentation The posts that said they were increasing it to last for 20 seconds said they were increasing it from 15 seconds to 20 seconds it only lasted 11 real seconds to begin with the 15 seconds was blizzard time So it s not like they intended to change it to 20 real seconds and fucked up they intended to increase it to 20 blizzard seconds and did so The patch is live post says from 11 seconds to 14 seconds They never should have said change it from 15 to 20 and that was confusing since they switched the game clock to use real seconds they should only communicate in real seconds but the change is what it was meant to be
Well it makes sense to use Blizzard time since they don t know what game speed you ll be playing at Not everyone plays just 1v1 ladder
balance changes only affect multiplayer where game speed is fixed
They also affect playing customs vs AI which can have a different game speed
Remember switching from Blizzard time to real time after nearly 17 years of it being the standard competition speed was a huge change that will probably take the development team a little bit to figure out
Of course when you take a look in the map editor s data module all of the values there look normal and rounded as they are intended for normal setting No 71 14 seconds and such They just didn t consider it properly when they should which means start of the engine development maybe
They originally made the game for normal game speed which was based on the normal game speed from the original Starcraft They hadn t yet decided how fast the game was actually going to be played
Maybe I wonder if it would be beneficial if for the next year or until people get this oddity figured out they should list times in both Blizzard seconds and real seconds
Also weapon speed is 0 71 which equals one second on faster setting before the time change for LotV
I m just an outsider but I believe it s because the engineers still work with Blizzard Time due to the underlying engine still using it Patch notes will probably continue to be posted in Blizz time I could be wrong tho
Yeah guys 20 seconds 14 seconds per Blizzard So if my calculations are correct ladder revamp will be here in 2 months and 20 days Someone check my math Edit Math 23 minutes 14 seconds Based on what Blizzard has given us with their time calculations we can use a proportional equation to figure out when ladder revamp will be here Let s convert seconds to minutes 23min 3min This reflects the first part of the equation 14seconds 20seconds Now lets turn months into seconds So there are 263520 minutes in 6 months accounting for the months that have an extra day So the equation will look like this 23 3 x 263520 X Is blizzard time So you cross multiply and divide finding that 6 months 202032 minutes in blizzard time Therefore ladder revamp will be here in roughly 2 months and 20 days
Please consider the soon tm constant and redo your math
fuck I hate logarithms
fuck i hate integrals
fuck i hate 3 dots
Lol
this is the negative unscontructive criticism dayvie was talking about
It s a joke
Has a joke to be funny for it beeing a joke
Funny or not it s a joke not negative unconstructive criticism
Okay its a dump unfunny joke But at least its a joke
So wait did Blizzard fuck up again or did we just read this wrong
I think they just made the change ignoring new clock
yes totally
From what I ve heard the Blizzard guys who write patch notes write them using the game s internal time system which is still using Blizzard Time AFAIK none of the patch notes have been in real time
The beta patch notes were updated I think At least if I recall correctly one of the patches increased the liberator move speed and it was not in blizzard time
They ve been putting patch notes in blizz seconds every time I guess it s easier for them
Also just tested it it s only 14 seconds
To be fair this was probably on the test map for us right
So both changes were made with old time so they don t last as long as advertised but have higher dps than advertised Is that how it is
Technically yes But it s still the same ratio That is it lasts 1 5 times as long as it used to
Basically DPS now is 30 0 71 42 With how they said it it was 30 1 30 Seems significant but let s wait for the eventual response from Blizzard if there s going to be one
Accidental balance O
Mine says 33 seconds P No photoshop no mods Ruins of Seras 0 7
welp all the time numbers for units on the official sc2 page arent updated yet as well so yeah they didnt get around to do all that yet I guess
Doesn t this make it a pretty big nerf rather than just forcing the placement into being more strategic instead of spammable I feel like that could undo PO s whole point of existence though i could be more wrong than i think
No They just used the old time scale It was changed as we expected it to be
I was under the assumption everyone de constructing the changes was using 20 sec as their timeframe
The duration was supposed to be 10 secs I guess that they decided to up it to 14 Oh well I won t complain
Blizzard is retarded just timed it on my phone and its 14 seconds
you are retarded indeed
