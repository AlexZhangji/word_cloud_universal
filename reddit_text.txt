I am really hoping for Leicester vs Barcelona in Champions League group stage next season
Messi whoBarcelona all over this placeNot sure if Barca or Leicester
Indeed Barca are sometimes reminiscent of Leicester
And that Messi lad he things he s got something on Mahrez
Yeah but I m glad he said something even if it was a weak insult It annoys me how the guy feels as a Barca fan he should give his seal of approval stamp of authority or whatever He doesn t play for Barcelona he s not Pep Guardiola or Messi or Enrique or Xavi or whoever the fuck you want to pick He s just a fan who chose to support the team but has no responsibility for the style of play It s like he thinks he s Eric Cantona in the Joga Bonito cage adverts Maybe I m being touchy
Barcelona esque
Leicester tiki taka Barca tiki taka
And the transition of Leicester to Barcelona is finally complete
Don t see Barca play much in their blue third kitReally you have no clue And you call yourself a football fan Football clubs are not franchises like those in Muirca Football clubs have always represented cities communities and should remain that way They re not supposed to be a business that makes money for some rich guy I don t even know why clubs aren t fan owned like in Germany or like they do with Barca and RealOne Lionel Messi and a plate of TapasEvergrande is bankrolled by the owner of Taobao which owns aliexpress and is far richer than Abramovich and a prominent real estate group they ve got an incredible amount of money and a history of delivering the highest amount of wages for the Chinese league even on time They re the team that actually started this trend of expensive foreigners playing here back in 2011 when Dario Conca arrived and became the third best paid player in the world only behind Messi and Ronaldo Drogba and Anelka had signed for a team with an eccentric owner who couldn t guarantee anything and even that club is now under new ownership by yet another real estate group and when you consider the construction boom in China they aren t running out of money soonHonestly as good as Yaya is he didn t fit well in the team at that moment at least for Busquets role I d say it was more of a big deal that he got benched for Keita and not even coming on as a sub They only used one sub in the match when they lost 3 1 It was a crazy game Probably spelled the end for Yaya Zlatan and Henry at Barca Zlatan got taken off right after they went down 3 1 for Abidal What kind of crazy shit was that Pep was trying to prove a point or something in that game I ve never understood it
All people do is talk shit about Yaya s defensive abilities but when he was at Barca he was the best Defensive midfielder in the world imo
Only because he had little to no defending to actually do since Barca had 99 9 possession under Pep allowing him just sit as the pivot and spread the ball about occasionally bursting forward in attack
Yes he sold him to Man City when they were both at barca
Pep essentially replaced Yaya with Busquets who was just some guy from the youth most people didn t rate at the time This eventually drove Yaya out of Barca
Barca player and La Masia grad who originally broke through to the main squad under Pep rumored to be unsettled currently and could seek out a move just seems like a natural fit
He was very effective as a cb for Barcelona against Chelsea and Drogba for example
let go of yaya and fernandinho bring in thiago and bartra de bruyne will be his messi
I already mentioned this over on Barca reddit but i m sure yaya will leave Guardiola replaced him with Busquets in Barcelona while busquets was just 20 I think And his lack of work rate is not something Guardiola will appreciate so I see him leaving to make room for another DM
His passing is never near that level don t be stupid For Barca Yaya had to play the disciplined DM role the advanced positions were occupied by technically better and more intelligent players In the end he was dropped for a B team player because this player was better technically and more intelligent and could read the game much fasterThere are a lot Rudi never changed his system he just stuck to his Barca inspired 4 3 3 no matter the opposition He was a fundamentalist never backing down from his ideas of the game His system got found out in the end Pep you genius bastard and Rudi never adapted Spaletti is much more practical and versatile He plays different systems based upon the opposition and what players are available from injuries and suspensions He likes to play more through the middle than the wings And he s a fiery personality that projects energy into the team something we ve been lacking severely after the players lost faith in Rudi s managementlets be honest though if we put one of the Bayern Barca Madrid in England they would dominate it
Would they really though I think they d win it regularly but if Athletico Madrid managed to beat both Barca and Madrid only a year a go to win the league why wouldn t Chelsea City or even United be able to sneak a win in
Well that s football no team is unbeatable no matter what delusional fans may believe This year in la liga Sevilla beat both Barca and Madrid in the league Celta also beat Barca Although tbf based on the last couple years Atletico is undoubtably better than those three teams you mentioned
Atletico are better than Chelsea City and United Just last year Barca trampled City whereas Atletico seem to hold their own most of the time Yea it s a small sample size but that s not all I m basing it on Atletico are incredibly tactically disciplined and I believe many people who like to see Koke Griezman Godin Gimenez etc play would say that the sheer raw talent level at Atleti is superior to what s on display at Chelsea and United and close enough to City
Nah they wouldn t Neymar Messi without PEDs would stay out injured 50 of the time
When people say PL fans are smug and pretentious this is the kind of comments they re referring to Pretending that only Bayern fans enjoy the Bundesliga or that only Barca RM AM fans enjoy La Liga is completely absurd How the fuck this got upvoted is beyond me
There are plenty of teams in la Liga that play an extremely physical game Atletico Athletic Espanyol just to name a few off of the top of my head It s a well understood and time honored tactic If your opposition is miles better than you when it comes to technique the only way to really beat them is to be superior physically Just watch Barcelona s latest games against Atletico and Espanyol as a reference
The key difference is that in La Liga whenever a player who plays for Barcelona or Madrid frowns he gets a free kick this was particularly true for Barcelona during Pep s time whereas England has rather less protection
I disagree Some smaller teams from la liga turn it up against the big guys physically But their overall game is much less intensity when they are playing the other teams Espanyol against barca is crazy Espanyol against other teams usually is a much tamer affair on average All PL teams are constantly in a dog fight
Well when you coach two teams with literally the greatest players at their positions in the history of football Messi Xavi Iniesta Neuer Boateng Robben etc your a little overrated to begin with Bayern seems to be the second team he has found issues with players and losing guys in the locker room Former Barca players dont speak to highly of Pep we all know the Ibra thing and he had problem with Eto o and many others We will see what he does with Man City again probably the best team in the BPL over the past few years
It will be tougher he doesnt have Messi on his team nor does he have a line up made mostly by World Cup winners and stars of international teams But he still has perhaps one of if not the best team in the premier league they are at the very least the most consistent
barca had messi tho
He doesn t just have one style of football He s played different styles with Barca and Bayern I m sure he ll adapt his style to English football
Pep doesn t have messi or muller anymoreLol you don t sesse to amaze with your bias and poor football Knowledge Comparing Carrillo with Djalo is like comparing Messi with GaitanRegarding ambition Let s point out that if he can win Spurs some silverware it will put the polish on his resume in a way that is hard to come by I think Simeone is more south after for winning the league with Atletico than if he had gone to say Bayern Real or Barca and won it there
If he goes and does a good job there will be very few better teams in world football You can argue either way I mean honestly Real or Barca aren t going to offer him a job based on getting Spurs into the CL
The same Real Madrid that within the last decade has given the job to Benitez Ramos Bernd Schuster no trophies Pellegrini no European trophies Is that the Real you are talking about And if Barcelona is willing to give the job to Gerardo Martino I don t see why Pochettino wouldn t be a viable candidate
I agree with Madrid but not with Barca Poch has spent over 10 years at Espanyol either as a player or a manager I would think that would be enough for Barca to think twice about him
Schuster was a bit of a legend at Barcelona He spent a decade there Different era All the appointments happened within the last 10 years Real Madrid started the era of the Gal cticos in 2000 So yeah Real Madrid in this very same era have done crazier hirings than hire Poch And the whole conspiracy thing is that why he is the manager of Argentina now because Messi insisted on it See edit
Read what I actually said Jesus Christ The grammar is sloppy but the point is there I said if Poch can get Spurs into a title challenge then he can certainly do it with us At which point the future hypothetical United would be back amongst the best in the world And even now let s be honest only Bayern Real and Barca are arguably bigger clubs Hence why my point was mostly in reference to the United vs PSG choiceexactly these liverpool supporters want messi and ronaldo at their club but also want to pay a tenner for a season ticket delusional
I don t think any Liverpool fan thinks Messi or Ronaldo are ever going to signCan t even fathom what Ronaldo or Messi would be offered China and Qatar will be competing for either of them at the end of their careerWilling to sell would have been a better choice of words It all depends on which league he s interesting in going to If G ndogan wishes to play in the PL City would definitely place a bid If Liverpool make the top 4 this year I could see that as a possible destination as well considering that he already knows the Klopp system very well If not then Real Barca Juve all seem like great teams to play for next year as well
In no universe will juve be on the same level as Bayern and Barca anytime soon
That s very optimistic They re not the only ones trying it and there s always diminishing returns it s easy to get from nothing to A tier but from A tier to S tier is a way different story Right now they don t attract players like Suarez or Lewandowski or Neymar and those are needed to break into the top clubs And not only one but a squad made of those players Sadly for Juve I don t think they ll hit that in the next 3 years they have a great squad a really great one but put them side to side with Bayern and Barca and the difference is obvious
u roadbuzz provided a good breakdown that I agree with But to your point the feeling factor is meaningful for some but not all players In the case of Gundogan he s German so probably he won t leave Dortmund unless it s a brand name EPL team Barca Madrid or Bayern To me if he s willing to go to PSG I don t see why he shouldn t be willing to go to Juve assuming wage offers are the same which they wouldn t be
I honestly believe that G ndogan stays at Dortmund if he doesn t get an offer from Barca or Real The team is playing great and he s having a lot of fun on the pitch and with his mates My prediction is that he gets a new contract with a really good salary and maybe moves after next season I don t see how he can miss out on the next season where Bayern may be beatable because of a new manager and where tehy have one last shot at the Champions League with a dream squad like now before someone else gets sold too
I hope so I really enjoy watching him play in Dortmund I don t think Real or Barca will come in for him though but who knows really
Watzke is constantly spouting some non sense but he is adamant that we wont lose more than one of the top 5 reus miki gundo auba hummels before 2018 if at all Gundogan has really looked pre injury form under tuchel It would be ill advised but If he wants to leave for barcelona or madrid then so be it but no way he makes just a SLIGHTLY step up to juventus Miki loves being in dortmund where the international media is not so bright and pestering and he can just enjoy his football Hummels i dunno dont really care if he cant appreciate what he has with bvb and thinks he needs to prove himself in the premiere league
There was a headline a week ago that Barcelona communicated to Juventus that they are no longer interested in Pogba You should be fine regardless what he does at the Euros
That makes no sense though It s like saying I hope Messi plays bad so he won t get a good contract
Difference is Messi plays for Barcelona already I don t want Pogba at Barcelona and bad form from him is the best way to keep him away from here It s not very hard to understand
Well no one is forcing Barcelona to buy him
I don t think G ndogan will leave for anything that isn t Barca Real or one of the top PL teams tbh I feel like he wants to establish his name as a world class player while also harvesting dat delicious money But of course I hope my boy Shinji convinces him to stay They re apparantly the biggest buddies ever even having lived together or something
Yeah Torres wasn t Barcelona quality either 1 goal can t make you good enough unfortunately
Why would Ilkay want to go to Juve It s not like Barca Real or ManU are knocking on the door tooGutted he s not joining his former Barca colleagues here tbh
Pep takes on Barca Spain wins the world cup Pep takes on Bayern Germany wins the world cup Pep takes on city England wins the world cup LOL JK
Maybe this is the point where we realise Guardiola is actually a terrible manager and he has just been carried by Messi and the lack of competition in Germany Right guys right
This is where City make a marquee signing for Pep from Barca and we don t get to see that theory tested yet cries at the thought
Let the Messi to City rumors begin again
Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan has invested on behalf of Abu Dhabi more than a billion pounds in Manchester City He invested in infrastructure players and marketing He has brought in plenty of new faces to the club and has turned City a mediocre club before Sheikh Mansur into a European Super Club However his best decision his best appointments were Ferran Soriano the influential Barcelona CEO and Barca s Sporting director Txiki Begiristain These are the guys that turned Barcelona into the most successful club in the last decade or so During their regime Bar a won 12 trophies including two Champions Leagues and four Spanish titles Bar a had won 16 Spanish titles in the 75 years prior to them taking over the club Their work in City is professional and impressive Yeah a lot of money has been spent on the club but Soriano has built an impressive network of clubs who work with and for City The Financial Fair Play worries have been dismissed the club has a wonderful new academy and has won plenty of trophies Most importantly these guys who gave Pep Guardiola his first chance at coaching a senior team back in 2008 and brought him back to Barcelona in 2007 brought in Pep to City City an underachiever in Europe will now be a club kids around the world will adore It s going to be a club that will compete for the Champions League trophy every season It is now not just a club that tries to emulate Barcelona it is a club that is made out of Bar a s DNAI really love Bayern s transfer policy If someone from Barca or Real had gotten injured before the deadline day they would have gone berserk and spend a crazy amount on some player not BayernSo does Messi sort of
What Messi can create chances out of nothing with the ball glued to his boots S derlund is a big player thats hard to deal with in the box who s main strenght is positioning that will try to flick on a cross or create space for his teammates
So you re telling me that the system isn t literally designed around Messi to make him the best he can be Players are only as good as a system lets them be
Difference is that messi would still be effective in another system because of his technique s derlund would be terrible if he wasnt handed the ball to tap in in the box Im not saying s derlund is terrible because of it but he relies on getting a lot of chances to get goals and i have a feeling st etienne wont be able to give him as many chances as rosenborg could based on the relative strenght of the leagues and how dominant rosenborg was last season
Norwegian MessiWhen Pep leaves Bayern whats the popular opinion with him possibly going back to Barca I mean Iniesta is getting up there in age as its logical that Thiago would be a natural replacement even though he signed an extension in August
He said sometime last year that rumors of him following Pep Moving to another club are I quote Bullshit and he is very grateful for the club for their very close support for him when he was injured I think this would be an indicator that he would want to stay at least for the mean time EDIT Found the link It doesn t contain info about a potential move to Barca but it should set the impression that he s staying https www reddit com r soccer comments 3xxz0o thiago on following pep to his new club thats
Samper isn t the same kind of midfielder as Iniesta he is generally a Busquets type player Great passing and vision and works well as the deepest midfielder in a three man midfield He is at best unproven in Iniestas role With all that said I hope he gets a real chance to prove himself in midfield He has been excellent in Barca B and over the few matches he has played in the A team If Lucho takes a liking to him he will get plenty of chances I haven t watched Kaptoum that much but Gumbau was dreadful when he was called up earlier this season
He s been great for Bayern in the games I ve seen As for wheather or not he s reached his potential I mean who honestly knows All I know is that I expected him to be at least as good as he is now no doubt Really hope the guy comes back to Barca one day I still long for the Thiago Rafinha brotherly midfield duo
He s such an entertainer and he always puts a smile to my face when hes playing just like when Ronaldinho did when he played for Barcelona Thiago is so much fun to watch I love a player that can dictate the midfield with flair and creativity those are my favorite kind of midfielders Edit I didn t actually answer the question just gave my own opinion on Thiago But I think he s not lived up to his potential Because I believe his potential is being spoken in the same sentences as Pogba Verratti James Rodriguez and so on But he isn t but you do see glimpses of pure genius when he s on the field then again he s only 24 and I hope and I also think he ll live up to his potential in the next few yearsImagine if he also scores the winning goal against Barcelona
So Can he play in the game against Barca or notHe was the highest rated DM on Who Scored in 2015 Not that Who Scored is the end all be all for player rankings of course http www skysports com football news 11095 10108268 top 100 players of 2015 where do lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo rankThat s not even enough for one Messi
Well that rules them out of getting Lionel Messi at least
They can and will sell a couple of guys tho But reality rules out Lionel Messi Not money
Peoppe suggesting the likes of Pogba Alaba M ller Thiago Messi Etc Basically any player on Real PSG Barca Bayern and Juventus are just wasting their time speculating
Personally I think Juve is the exception here Obviously Juve is at the top of Italy right now and for the most part they will retain their best players but they do not have the money to compete with Real Barca PSG Bayern or City If City or PSG or Real put a big contract in front of Pogba Juve will struggle to come close to matching Granted I think Real or PSG is a more likely destination for Pogba than City
City have a decent pedigree but not the pedigree of the clubs they re currently rubbing shoulders with the elite of the sport There s no denying City have history but there are a good number of other lesser English teams with similar history the money is what made them now be at a similar tier as Madrid Barcelona Munich etc Give it a decade or two though and people will be much more accepting of their status We re already seeing it with Chelsea that they re considered more seriously now than they were in the early Abramovich days since there s newer new money clubs to hate on now
Messis only go for Pep bros
I would hazard that our bench Roberto Bartra Rafinha etc is getting raided EDIT I forgot about Samper Also I want him to buy Grimaldo from Benfica and then watch r barca riot
I don t think he d want to leave He s getting a decent amount of playtime right now with Barca comes on almost every game and starts some too plus he could learn so much from Busquets Iniesta and Arda if he stays And to top that off he gets to play with MSN I think he d want to stay
The critics are fair though Where has Pep proved himself without the fattest transfer budget in that respective league Barca are pretty much on par with Real Madrid in terms of spending prowess so don t you dare try to mention that and we all know how dominant Bayern are in Germany and buying up all the league s talent
Saying this makes you look witty and gives your comment upvotes but come on now Tata Martino managed to go trophyless while in charge of a Barca side that had Messi Neymar and Alexis as the front 3 essentially the same backline that Luis Enrique currently has and World Cup winning midfielders like Busquets Iniesta Fabregas and Xavi
What does that even mean Would you take a more shit job with less pay than the one you have now just to prove that you can do the job you have now The dude has won like 19 trophies in 6 full years as a manager He s won the CL twice and always at least made the semis He took a Barca team that finished a distant 3rd got rid of most of its biggest names promoted some unknown youngsters and in the process created one of the best teams in history If it was so easy then we wouldn t see managers ever fail at big clubs But when Pep continuously succeeds people say that somehow it s easy Just ridiculous Does anyone have a good argument as to why Pep should ever take one of those jobs if he can manage the very top clubs Because so far I haven t seen one
Schumacher won a race in a car stuck in 5th gear Barcelona 96 is on the list of the absolute greatest drives in the history of motorsports He won a race against the FW14B one of the 3 most dominant cars in F1 history Schumacher did exactly what you re implying and what people imply Guardiola never did We can argue about the latter but your comparison is completely wrong
While Real were a top team for the entirety of Guardiola s time at Barca he did have probably the best squad ever playing for him
And he made them who they were with his famous system Enough with the revisionist history The team would not have been as good as it is today without his influence Xavi Iniesta Busquets even Messi would not have been the players they are without Guardiola Many Barca players have themselves testified to his genius and how much of an influence he had in that team Before people start comparing to Luis Enrique the way they play today still carries Guardiola s DNA Luis Enrique and Tata Martino did not come up with the rondo pressing style themselves they built upon what was already there
I think Barca s squad now is probably better It s largely the same except for no Xavi and Suarez and Neymar which IMO makes up for it The reason that side was so great was the way they played
That s a bit chicken and egg no No doubt players like Xavi Messi Iniesta were massively talented but other than those three the team wasn t that exceptional Yeah I do realise how ridiculous that sounds The vision of those players was is massive but I was always more impressed with the way they were playing tiki taka and not so much the individual exploits of those players I m sure the talent massively helped him but I do sincerely doubt other managers with different playing styles eg Mourinho could ve gotten their potential completely fulfilled like that
This is obviously me speculating out of my ass but I would think Pep is going to want a ball playing CB and some new FBs all of City s FBs are over 30 Yaya was gone the day Pep signed the contract so he ll need to be replaced Past that it s a matter of how he wants to build his team I m most interested to see how he s going to try and fit David Silva and KdB into the lineup When they re both fit City has to play them both and their options at RW are mostly shit so putting KdB out there ends up working out alright The team looks much more cohesive when either KdB are Silva are on the bench and there are two natural wide players on the field IMO At Barca pepe always had great wide players and at Bayern he s made the wingers the focal point of his attack Neither KdB or Silva playing as a winger offer Pep what he wants out of someone playing wide I m really not sure what he s going to do
There are some wrong assumptions here like Bayern players following him which won t happen I think Guardiola will try to rebuild City s midfield by going after the kind of players like Gundogan Weigl Oliver Torres Andre Gomes and players alike He will also go after fullbacks like Gaya could be a target for him He may go for a RB and a couple of ball playing defenders as well If he has money left maybe after selling some players he may go after Griezmann and maybe some Barcelona youth players I don t think he ll go after many or any Premier League players I think he ll sell at least 3 or 4 players
Not quite Messi s buyout clauseThat is true If he would have had the balls to bench Ronaldo and the team got better he would have had absolute power to do whatever he wanted Instead he tried playing the charismatic leader and politics games and it failed He lost the dressing room then the results started to slip On top of that he was content with sitting back after a 1 goal lead which the team didn t have the players to play that style The best defense Real Madrid is attack similar to Barca Barcelona s defense isn t the best but they re in control all game where they don t worry about it too much We are the same except better on the counterThe same can be said about footballers in the presence of Messi and Ronaldo Many players like Suarez and Aguero have to live in their mighty shadows
Higuain while in RM was always the best example of this for me Everyone was calling him shit all the time because he would underperformed when compared to his teamates but his direct competition at RM was CR and in Argentina he played directly in front of Messi Can t really compete with that Now that he s moved he s doing much better and people no longer consider him an utter failure maybe it was just my friends
The analogy doesn t work though because Suarez is winning everything now that he s playing alongside Messi Football is a team sport and nobody really cares about the individual awards at least in the UK A better analogy would be Atletico in La Liga In any other era they d be considered one of the top top teams in the world because of their incredible organisation and teamwork elevating the team to greater than the sum of their parts and winning multiple league titles but they re not going to win trebles in the current era because RM and Barca outspend them by 5 1 and build incredibly stacked squads
You just reduced his quality to allowing messi to be the best player in the world and then ruining Bayern by making them the only legitimate contenders for the bundlesliga for three consecutive seasons Does he need to win the CL with Swindon Town to be a commodity I don t remember Pellegrini establishing anything close to dominance at the clubs he has managed
I don t really have a well established opinion on Pellegrini one way or the other but Pep s managerial career consists of being made to look good by Messi and then making Bayern a substantially less formidable opponent than they were before he turned up My doubts aren t so much Pellegrini is amazing as they are I m not at all convinced of Pep s supposed genius
Bayern are the same formidable squad they were before pep they just happened to steamroll the CL in a season where there was a power vacuum where the clubs in a position to challenge them were in crisis As for the reductionist idea that messi made pep s career ask Tata how easy it is to manage a club with the best player in the world
Luis Enrique has Su rez at his disposal who is the best striker in the world and a settled Neymar who has been the best player on earth this season I m not trying to diminish Enrique s achievement but you must be really really stupid to compare Tata s squad to Enrique s squad Guardiola turned Barca from a good team to the best of all time Don t forget they came in third before he took over and then they won the sextuple They weren t bad by any means won the CL a few years before Guardiola took over but they were nowhere nowhere near as good as they became under Guardiola
Going out to Barca is no shame Before city he actually had a decent CL career where he took Villarreal and Malaga to Quarters and Semisheaven forbid he is actually really good People seem to forget that messi or ronaldo dont get best players of the month every month Why because they are consistent Chicharito actually deserves itbecause he has been amazing if his form keeps being like this then the awards will stop coming
so why messi and ronaldo dont get it every monthId say its a mental thing teams in the premier league dont look at the big boys with fear anymore They think they can actually get points sometimes and they do So as our top teams arn t winning over and over again When they go to europe they re confidence is nothing like that of barcelona who many teams they face in la liga don t believe they have a chance in hell Not taking away from the ability of teams like Barca Real or PSG just saying it can sometimes be more due to mentality than abilty when we re talking european performances
Nobody talked about winter breaks in the middle of the 2000 s when English clubs were great Look at PSG Barca Bayern Juve Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid They would all be among the top top favourites to win the Premier League they have generally better players and management and many of them are filthy rich English clubs simply lack that quality Imo its only City and Arsenal that will have the combination of top players and manager to really threaten in Europe in the near future
The only English club that generate more or same money as PSG Barca Bayern and Real is United So those teams should be top favorites in the Premiere League English clubs dont lack quality English clubs have the problem that the bottom teams in the league have more money as clubs Napoli Villareal Fiorentina etc etc The Premier league has become a monster with too much money and the overall level of the league becomes too high Its almost impossible to compete in Europe at the same time
The Premier League was fairly dominant in Europe a while back it s just going through a weak spell right now for whatever reasons I wouldn t be surprised at all if in a few years time we start seeing all English champions league semis finals again Barca Real and Munich aside no one else can really compete with them financially
La Liga is just Madrid Atletico and Barcelona trying to catch up No one else can realistically compete with them Compeititon wise the premier league is the best out of the top five Talent wise it s behind the Bundesliga and La Liga imho It depends on how you look at things
Real and Atletico had transfer bans for most of it and Barca signed their players last yearguardiola era xavi Iniesta messi dominance and the longevity of that dominance la mesia with a tid bit of Luis Enrique and his very successful first season there rest we ll seePlayers who publicly attack the fans club or openly leave for money especially Cole with the tapping up conviction get shit on deservedly If Eden Hazard publicly demanded a transfer to Madrid while throwing the club under the bus I d expect that you d do the same Meanwhile Thierry Henry went to Barca and still got a statue at the Emirates and was warmly welcomed back when he came on loan Clichy Vermaelen Viera Sagna others are all generally well thought of by supporters There s some nutters but every club has those types
I can only recall his attitude being a problem twice in his 5 years at city Once against Barcelona last year and late during the Mancini era Besides that he has been a great professional for usNot saying he s a bad guy but last season he publicly blamed the refs when played against Barcelona it was pretty much a fair game and got suspended for a match or so So he isn t flawless

Shame about drawing Barca in the CL everytime but he brought great football to the league Good to know that he wants to stay aroundOzil hitting the top bar from a long shot vs Barcelona
Yup this was the one I immediately thought of Not just cause its an absolute cracker of a shot but because it was Ozil at his peak of im not gonna ever shoot im just going to rack up insane assists and it was against Barcelona I remember thinking hmm will he play Ronaldo through or Big Benz or HOLY SMOKES WHERE DID THAT COME FROM
This one Portugal vs Spain Goes past a player drops Pique to the floor with one turn and scoops it over Casillas from a tight angle and its going in almost gone in and Nani comes in from nowhere and heads it in but he s apparently offside so no goal Would ve been one of his best goals if it wasn t for Nani messing it up that idiot
Jobi McAnuff for Reading against Liverpool Kolo Toure for Arsenal against Sunderland Edinson Cavani for Napoli against BarcelonaAlso Fabregas said he wouldn t leave Arsenal for another prem team He didn t He left Arsenal for Barcelona He never said he d never play for another prem side
You might as well ask Messi while you re at itThey don t need to sell him though is the point no Unless they were getting a player who right now is better why sell Ronaldo and to whom The only club I think they could sell him to is PSG and that may not be in their best interest of PSG starts performing to their talent in Europe I think they do want Neymar but I don t think he will leave Barca because even if release clause is hit they will offer him more money to stay especially if the club in question was Madrid
Bit surprising how eager some Madridistas are to cash in on him and sell him for the profit I d probably want Barcelona to carry Messi for as long as he wanted after he declined even if he had to be benched Though I suppose that s the issue Ronaldo wouldn t want to be benched for anyone
I think it s different Messi is much more connected sentimentally to Barcelona than Ronaldo is to Real Madrid
Messi will still be a very effective player even if he does not score any goals Ronaldo without goals Completely useless
Messi s been with Barcelona since he was 12 fans will always feel closer to the homegrown players It d be better to compare Ronaldo to Ronaldinho Barcelona fans weren t too bothered to see Ronaldinho leave
When the main opposition has Suarez Neymar and Messi that won t be nowhere near enough
True still if we were to replace Ronaldo and establish a new main man it should be someone close to the level of the players in Barcas trio bale and James are not
I think the decision to sell him is totally commercial Can they still get a substantial fee for him Yes just about But all things considered such as his wages and bonus payments I would bet that keeping him for the remainder of his contract is commercially worth more than it costs to run him By commercially I mean shirt sales sponsorship interest from Asia where he is massive etc If he stops being arguably the most famous footballer or one of the two if you include Messi who I personally don t think is globally as high profile then his commercial value wanes but I doubt it ever will
He is admittedly a Barcelona fan and the majority of his comment history is dedicated to Ronaldo
Highly unlikely but maybe he is talking about the Brazillian Ronaldo because he played a year at Barcelona but that means he is likely 40 or something But OP is probably a 12 year old american who is watching since the WC 2014
No lol Check out his history It s clear he s talking about Cristiano Ronaldo He also says he s a Barcelona fan tooYup they had a few recent successes Schweinsteiger Lahm also M ller Kroos Alaba and possibly H jbjerg Gaudino but overall they don t have a high rate of successful output as in transfers from the junior teams to the first team Part of it is that that they are at a very high level and making the jump into the first squad is just harder But they also invested in a new academy and if I remember correctly Pep was also involved a bit in that from his success with Barca s second squad That s probably because they know they can t just rely on buying good players for cheap all the times and especially not with the PL slowly getting around to looking a bit more into the relatively cheap Bundesliga talent And with the PL having even more money in the future and Germany not getting comparable TV money they will need to rely more on their own academy in the coming yearsSo take double chance 12 bets on all Barca games vs top clubs Interesting
Barca didn t close you guys near their goal well I remember Dani gave Nolito too much space plus all the attacks came from your right pressing in the middle was great But in our favour rafinha was recently injured and we played Roma midweek
yeah i remember watching that bayern needed to score 5 goals in 45 minutes to advance and enrique knew that wasnt going to happen so he took off suarez and played double pivot to stay fresh for the final that 3 2 scoreline made the semi look a lot closer than it actually was when in reality barca just simply outclassed bayern throughout
no it was 2 1 barca at half time so they were leading 5 1 on aggregate hence they needed 5 goals if youre going to be pedantic at least be right
Yes the 3 0 was against a reduced Bayern squad as was the 1 3 against PSG But tell the truth PSG had strong squads for the 3 1 in the group stage and the 2 0 in the quarter finals EDIT Since I m getting downvoted for facts 1 For the 3 1 group stage match Barca won while missing Rafinha Alves and Vermaelen PSG was only missing Bahebeck 2 For the 2 0 win PSG was missing Motta Silva and Aurier We were missing Vermaelen
And not to mention when Bayern destroyed us 7 0 on aggregate we didn t have a fully fit squad including a certain Messi Luck plays a role in these competitions
Revenge for Barca missing key players in the 7 0
I think u AGNVHL is saying is that the Bayern loss was the second leg of a semi final whose first leg Barcelona had won 3 0 Barca were never in any danger of failing to go through
Yeah Bayern got that early goal but Barca responded with two quick ones to put the match away early
The Barca board seem ballsy with their appointments the last decade or so they ve gone with relatively inexperienced managers and it s working a treat for them
Prepare to add 2 more losses to that when Barca plays Arsenal
If these were taken as aggregate like they should for CL then it s only RM that has outdone him Barca beat RM in Nou fixture right
Like total aggregate or just for those two league fixtures On total Enrique s Barca wins 7 4 on aggregate but if you only count last season s league games then Real wins 4 3
Blues haven t played Barcelona during the season since 2012 mate
If you re wondering there are so many Barca related stats its because this group of barca fanatics keeps churning them out https twitter com G14 en
I think you mean Barca s record vs top teams
Its funny how little games against top teams barca have compared to the PL where a team would have loads of big games a season
Considering this doesn t include Villereal Valencia Celta Vigo and Athletic Bilbao all of whom would have beaten everyone in the Premier League bar Chelsea and potentially Man City I think it s rash to assume that this list alone means that Barcelona play less big games than they would do if they were in the Prem
Celtic 2 1 Barcelona How could you leave that one outWe got Calum Eat your heart out Messi Chambers anywayInternational football and Champions League football are different things though As much as I love him Zlatan hasn t performed really well in the CL knockout stages with us yet I m hoping for this season to be his season San Siro final giving Barcelona a hell of a beating would be the peek of his careerMessi to La Masia confirmed This transfer deadline day is going crazy
that s not the whole of it Some spanish speakers can see that Messi seems a bit off when he talks like he s a bit slow
Well yeah it is huge but Messi Xavi Iniesta Sergio and co are all alumni and they train less than a mile away and play less than a mile away They live and breathe Catalonia and live and breathe La Masia and are essentially there every single day bar vacations and away days All those kids in every single level live in these players shadows and essentially have at least one of them come by at least once a year I mean I can t confirm that but seeing as how Chelsea does it I d be shocked if these guys haven t met one of the club legends at least once or twice They re not just new imports and new recruits they re captains I d fully understand if they re nervous and camera shy because they re about to have their big break But I d be genuinely surprised if each of them were genuinely star struck He may be their role model and hero but they re still deep in La Masia s system and therefore are all in the family
Hell Messi seems really nervous Is this dude going to ever not be awkward
he s so fucking awkward the kids are all scared shitless but messi can t look anyone in the eye must be shitty having these heart to hearts with 45 cameras around the table and kids reading written questions
Here s Messi a bit more relaxed for comparison
well the title literally translates to Lionel Messi drunk so it s possible
I actually think he has gotten a lot better at this kind of stuff He used to be extremely awkward to the point of almost Autistic Now he seems more composed but still slightly Messi awkward I think that its his way of avoiding too much attention that could make him arrogant If he was to truly see how much people thought of him he may feel that it will effect his play
He gave a sort of revealing for him interview when he was quite young and he mentioned that he felt it was very noticeable how small he was as a kid before he had the hormone treatments he said wherever he went it drew attention I always assumed that growing up being subject to so much of the wrong type of attention made him very shy and wary of being the focus of it even as an adult But I agree in the past year or so he seems more over it When he got the Ballon d Or I was bracing myself for another awkward Messi moment where he mumbles something about how it s all about the team and he doesn t like individual awards but thanks anyway He was pretty poised and gracious about it this time
This is such a stupid rumor What basis do you or anyone else have for knowing he s aspergers Are you or anyone in the media privy to his medical history Or do you just base it off of the fact he s an awkward guy in front of the camera If you were to have a look at most people I m sure you would find that there are plenty of people who act just like Messi and shy away from the spotlight when its put their way Doesn t make them aspergers Don t be ignorant
Don t be too hard on u TheMexicanJuan this is a pretty pervasive myth I m embarrassed to say that I actually know the source of all this it was some terribly written article on Portuguese written years ago Interestingly it was a reddit post translating it that made it go global As a journalist once wrote about another football story it just spread like sports news syphilis It s the same situation with the story with Messi and Pep and the can of Coke It all came down to one terrible article with no quotes or sources But sports journalism is often a lot more about what people want to read and not about the truth So people perpetuate these stories Superficially Messi does seem a little bit like an idiot savant because not only is he so good at what he does he is unusually reserved and socially awkward for a professional athlete at his level Of course spending more than a few minutes really watching him makes it clear he just a normal guy who doesn t love talking to the press or the public but it sure makes a great narrative if he has some brain disorder that makes him like a superhero
Wow he still get s emotional when he talks about leaving Argentina Coincidentally Sport just published a picture of Leo supposedly on the day he arrived at Barcelona For those who were confused with the translated interview when he said that he missed his family but he lived with his parents while at La Masia he actually only said he lived with his father the rest of his family were in Argentina
iirc from his biography he had both his parents with him in his first year in Barcelona but after that his mother moved back to Argentina because his younger sibling was still attending school there so he was living mainly with his dad when he was at la masia
Aw man I like this guy For native Spanish speakers or Catalan speakers how was Messi s Spanish here Was it still very thick with Argentinian accent or were they all speaking Catalan and so was Messi or how was it really I ve read various times on this sub that Messi doesn t speak Catalan in interviews he sticks to Spanish with his thick Argentinian accent but I d reckon he d try to make himself clear for these kids I m not saying they re stupid so they understand and it is a smooth chat
It was definitely Spanish and Messi sounds quintessentially Argentine still Lots of SH sounds for starters
does messi know Catalan how different is it from spanish
It hasn t changed a bit His argentine accent is still as thick as when he was here For the kids though they are speaking spanish aswell its normal for people in Catalunya for Spanish to be their first language Jordi Alba for example he didnt really speak catalan when he was in our youths but he does now Xavi is an example of the other way around he learned spanish later on I havent seen Messi speak catalan but he understands it perfectly
I think Messi speaks little Catalan He doesn t speak it in the video and his accent is noticeable but not ridiculously prominent
this is my favorite stereotypical Argentine accent lol you can see Messi s is not so strong
Messi giving advice to best player in history of football
Messi couldn t see his family much when he was younger BibleThump
Messi is such a stand up guy the kids at la masia have an amazing role model to look up to I wonder if Ronaldo did something with the captains of the RM Jr Sides and whether he was as respectful as Messi
As I was watching I thought the kid sat to Messi s right was Dani Alves and I was thinking to myself Why has no one asking him a question yet bit unfair but suppose they have a chance to talk to Messi fuck Alves I then realised it was the u19A captain and he asked a question
Naruto might be mainstream but jeez dude there isn t that much of an overlap between r soccer and r naruto But even for me who knows the show No it s not like that at all Neymar didn t really have a problem with Messi at all nor was he a negative character Messi never fucked up the way Naruto did at all If you really want an anime analogy he s more like Goku Un fucking touchable all powerful alien like Right when you think you caught up to him he is miles ahead of you
Mate the only anime DBZ analogy in football is the Goku Vegeta being Messi Ronaldo respectivelyCould very well be I remember when he wouldn t address media in English Haha Messi to Spurs you heard it here first
I d take Messi even if he had one legYou don t just call a player the next Leo Messi
I wouldn t call him the next Messi but he is exceptionally talented The way he plays is also a bit akin to Messi He s got amazing dribbling along with the low CG and a mean left foot The resident scout u discopopshop posted a clip of him where he pointed out he d never seen someone move their feet so quickly Then again thousands of next Messi s have come never to be heard of againHave always said I never have been impressed with wilshere apart from that one Barcelona game and everyone just goes back to that when I bring it up but he s the most overhyped player everIt s sad we get mugged off all the time by foreign teams all we sign are European rejects are biggest signings are Real Madrid and Barcelona rejects
Ah thought the we referred to you guys p It s what happens when there s so much money floating about Liverpool and Man Utd are the only teams with a name history to rival the Reals Bayerns and Barcas yet they ve either been largely unsuccessful of late and or don t have a particularly safe positive image at the moment Our biggest teams are absolutely second rate in the world game yet the PL teams down to mid table at the very least have top rate financesEvery game immediately after Barca dropped points is kinda important We always slip up when they do so in a way Betis was an important game
Dirty tactics I guess He had a pretty unfavorable record against Barcelona during his stint there as well
He returned us to Europe after Pellegrini and numerous other coaches had embarrassing exits in the ro16 and QF He won us our first Copa against Barcelona no less after not winning a Copa in what 20 years He won the league He built the team that won La Decima
Get the ball At least that s what Messi does
Messi plays a deeper position than ronaldo
Because Messi is able to do that Ronaldo isn t No hate but that s true
Both are getting older their teams are changing and they have new colleagues to accommodate Messi moved further back and Ronaldo more forward It s how they work Messi wasn t always the finisher he became after a few years at Barcelona but he was always a playmaker He went back to his roots
Uh yea Messi was always a finisher ever since he was born
Messi was able to pick up the ball the fucking halfway line against bilbao in a cup final and beat players all the way and score a goal If ronaldo is as good as messi or better as some claim than he should be able to do the same The teammates have very little to do in goals such as these
They are both great players with different skillsets I do think messi is better than Ronaldo
I am never one for downplaying what Ronaldo has done at Madrid but even suggesting he is as good as Messi at this stage is ludicrous Those who go further and honestly believe he is a better footballer are insane
Messi was probably always better but there can t be any rational people who think Ronaldo is on Messi s level today
They don t understand football it s the only explanation Messi does things that are unimaginable until you ve seen him do it Ronaldo just does things very very well
I agree that messi is the best footballer but that doesn t mean that we define the best footballer by having messis skillset That s like saying Messi can t score a header while covered by 2 opposing players If he was as good as ronaldo he should be able to do that They are 2 different players with 2 different skillsets Just because Messi s looks better doesn t mean he is the better player
That s like saying if messi s as good as ronaldo let s see him score a rocket from 40 yards out
That s an incredibly stupid attitude to have So you can only be the best if you can dribble half the pitch and score It seems like you ve just found some way to disqualify everyone else for the sole purpose of saying that Messi is better The point is that you can t expect Ronaldo to beat the opposition all by himself in every big match like you re implying
It s not even like Messi is the only player who can do that sure he s the best but other players can dribble half the pitch and score
Maybe Messi is better than Ronaldo but just because Ronaldo doesn t play exactly the same way Messi does doesn t automatically disqualify him as equal It s hard to argue I know because most of the greats e g Maradona and Cruyff have been playmaking ball grabbing totalfootball goal monsters But it s up for debate if that is only way to be one of the true greats Ronaldo has done plenty of things Messi can t do
Ask an Argentinian under Maradona Messi didn t manage to ever get the ball It s a team sport
Right because the rest of the team was great in the big games and he was crap No the biggest culprits in the big game are the central mid Against Barca he had none of the ball he wasn t completely awful with the ball while the rest of the team were great Real Madrid fans are the least reliable source of information they ll turn on the team or a player in a second People conveniently forget last year he scored in both legs against Juve both league games against Barcelona scored against Atletico in the league assist against them in the CL Year before goal assist in CL final and huge number of goals in important games throughout the CL run Scored or assisted in both Barca league games also and scored against Atletico in the league 1 fucking year he has a relatively slow year and is still amazing just less amazing and Real fans think they should sell him because he can t score in big games it s genuinely pathetic
get the ball dribble and score like Messi
Except that thread has 0 upvotes and was submitted by a Madrid fan called Magical Messi10 It s only on the front page because the content submitted to r realmadrid is so little Almost anything will reach the front page there
Early on he was criticized for not doing much in the Clasicos but then at one point he had scored in 6 or 7 matches in a row against Barca if I remember correctly
Is it that shocking He played them both two times and in total he played 26 games this season so in 15 of his games he scored 44 of the goals Plus you know how the whole team of Real Madrid underperforms against Atletico Barcelona Espanyol kept Barca at 0 0 and Malmo plays in the CL yet he bangs in a lot of goals against them Nothing to get too fixated about imo
espanyol plays their hearts out against barca and let madrid walk on them tho
I think you usually play your hearts out when you re facing your city rivals Besides we have the same record as Barcelona does vs Espanyol during the last 10 liga games But hey if it suits your narrative
25 isn t very old really I d say 25 is the make or break part of your career Its when you re young enough to have a window of potential but too old for that dumb he s young give him a break argument Hazard and Oscar for that matter can still get better and better Willian looked like he had a lot of potential when he was their age and now he s at peak form Now if you were to tell me someone like Andre Schurrle is still young and may grow to be a huge part of the German NT again I d cringe internally And notice he s the same age as Hazard Truth is Hazard is young enough for Madrid to keep an eye on him But he s old enough for people to really start weighing him up against senior players like Ronaldo Ribery Robben and Messi as opposed to weighing him up against the likes of Gotze Sterling Sharaawy Pogba and co not to say he s at Messi s or Ronaldo s level just that he s technically in their age group now Basically if at 25 you still need time to develop and show your worth you re probably a lost cause But if you re truly talented and people know you re worth like Hazard then its totally fair to spend big to bring you over to develop
From an outsiders perspective Ronaldo is just the brand of the modern Real Madrid I see a dozen little Ronaldo s everyday in their shirts the same with the little Messis and Neymars Even now I rarely see a Bale
Why does he have to be a carbon copy of Ronaldo I ve never understood this The new player can contribute in other ways it s not like Benzema Bale Isco James Modric Kroos don t know how to score And not even mentioning two of the best offensive defenders Ramos and Marcello Ligas aren t won by winning 8 0 instead of 2 0 Once Messi retires Barca shouldn t try to find a replacement for a player who is arguably the best playmaker in the game has insane statistics with his passes while scoring 50 goals a year It s not reasonable Ronaldo and Messi were above and beyond other players you can replace them without trying to copy them Bayern are doing well without a Messi or Ronaldo
not carbon copy one cannot even replace gerrard or xavi let alone cristiano or messi that s just the direction to think about and it is hard even to think of a player who might have that level of potential
I would argue barca has already found a replacement for messi if they can sort out his ridic wage demands
Reus would be the perfect signing imo Probably the best winger in the world that is not playing for Bayern or Barca Much better than the likes of Hazard offensively and I think he could really contribute
except football doesn t work like that Whoever you use to replace cristiano except messi Bale and Benzema are more likely than him to score those missing goals You can plug in the formula with Lewan Reus Neymar or even Suarez and still this is the natural conclusion
Real is going to miss Cristiano real bad once he s gone They will know when Barca and Atletico beat them every time for maybe 2 years
It s forever been an argument though Ronaldo doesn t score in big games Just like how morons say Messi can t do it without Xavi and Iniesta
Just because the Messi Ronaldo debate is raging in this thread I thought I would add my own views I ve never been a fan of Ronaldo and have always preferred Messi s attitude and general demeanor so perhaps that adds a certain amount of bias to my opinion But I must admit Ronaldo has been and is a fantastic player He s worked bloody hard for it too And this is the difference for me Ronaldo is more of a supreme athlete and credit where credit is due he has used this to his advantage Messi on the other hand is the total footballer the more natural footballer That s not to say he hasn t worked hard at all but I just think watching Messi is like watching magic play out whereas watching Ronaldo is like watching a well oiled factory destroying its opposition because of its sheer size and efficiency Perhaps that s not a great analogy But that s how I see it I also see Messi as being the better team player as well and that makes a huge difference The best footballer isn t the one who selfishly goes about his career doing things for himself Bringing other players into a game or heightening their ability is just as impressive if not more so
People are so ungrateful The consistent excellence of Ronaldo and Messi has spoilt everyone The moment Ronaldo starts to show signs of being human people jump on his back And he just scored a hattrick We re all going to look back on the last few years as an anomaly Will we ever experience such binary luminescence as Messi and Ronaldo
It isn t news normally but it does become more relevant when we are talking about a player who has been one of the best in the world for almost the last 10 years 0 goals against Atletico Barca PSG Villareal Sevilla etc isn t a coincidence when we re talking about a player of Ronaldo s caliber
Stop trying to be so nice Aduriz has scored 5 goals vs Barcelona this season Let alone a few against Villareal Eibar Of which Ronaldo has scored 0 Most top strikers in La Liga have scored at least one goal vs the top 6 teams Ronaldo has scored 0 It is an insanely bad statistic Not Ronaldo bad but any striker bad For the best player in one of the best teams in the world it s not just bad it s absolutely atrocious Messi for instance was injured for like two months He still scored Sevilla 2 Bilbao 2 Atl Madrid 2 Roma 2 Equivalent of PSG for Real Even though he missed a lot he still managed to score 8 goals against top tier teams that Real scored 0 against Yes Roma PSG but it s the closest comparison There is no excuse for not scoring a single goal against the top 6 teams in your league as the best player in Real Madrid and only 2 against the entire top half Especially when you dominate the penalty records as in being the player who takes the most penalties in all top leagues in all seasons Along with being the player who takes the most shots by FAR of ANY offensive player There is no excuse don t be so nice
It s a well known fact that Espanyol tend to roll over v Madrid as they are Barca s greatest rival but imagine if Rayo or Atletico did the same v Barca Nuns would get UEFALONA tramp stamps
facts since 1994 barcelona has scored 96 against espanyol and conceded 37 real has scored 104 and conceded 35The Ronaldo Messi wankfest is starting early today Why are some in red
i think the point most people are making is that if he had neymar suarez and Iniesta supporting him instead of bale benz and isco he still probably would be racking up the goals and assists in the big games I can t imagine if you replaced Ronaldo with Messi barca would stop being as dominant And I can t imagine if you replaced Ronaldo with Messi in that 4 0 barca would lose it s a team sport and barca has a much better team
Your argument is like getting angry at Everton for failing to win the PL because they have great players like Lukaku Baines and Mirallas Neymar and Suarez are the 3rd and 4th best players in the world Bale and Benz are very good players but nowhere close Iniesta Rakitic and Busquets are significantly better than Modric Kroos and Casemiro Better support players makes scoring and assisting easier He s still outscoring Messi and assisting more than him It s not like Ronaldo s struggling In half a season of his supposedly worst form he s matched the best world class seasons of Henry Totti RvN etc In big games his team doesn t play well That s not up for debate Barca is a better team that s been better managed
Iniesta and Rakitic are significantly better than Modric and Kroos Modric is arguably the best midfielder in the world and Rakitic isn t in the same level as Kroos Kroos and Modric play in a 2 man midfield and neither of them is a CDM while Iniesta and Rakitic have the best DM in the world behind them It s not Kroos s fault he isn t utilized properly and yet he s been very good these past two months As for Messi it would make a huge difference if Ronaldo were to replace him Messi is the GOAT and he can win games even when his team are having an awful game he can create goals by himself Ronaldo on the otherside has been nothing but a poacher in the past 2 seasons Real and Barca both have great squads but Messi is the difference maker
Iniesta is much better than Modric and Rakitic is much better than Kroos Barca would still destroy Madrid if you switched Messi and Ronaldo Suarez and Neymar are so much better than anyone else on Madrid
Just by checking his recent post history I got a headache He seriously thinks Barca would ve won everything last year even if Messi didn t play for them One of the stupidest things I ve read in a while
Off the top of my head I dont think they would have gotten past Bayern as easily without Messi going full Messi
Much better is the part I m questioning Less than two years ago Modric was better and there was no question about it but since then Barcelona as a whole has significantly improved and Iniesta has been better There s no doubt that Iniesta at his peak is far better than Modric but to be able to suggest that Iniesta right now is much better than Modric shows clear bias towards Iniesta
I m not sure I agree Modric has periods of being world class and is always a top player Iniesta has periods of being only a top player but is normally world class At modrics best probably the middle of the unbeaten run you would still never put him under messi Ronaldo as the no 3 let alone really in the same breath as those two but iniesta has been hanging around there most of his career For me iniesta has a decent margin over modric career wise On his best day modric sure puts up a fight though
Lol at lukaku baines mirallas being called GREAT Messi have been injured for 2 months
That s the point Barca has an insane squad they don t even need Messi
If that s what you said then it s crap they do need Messi indeed He has scored important goals and he s always there when it matters when the others couldn t capitalise
Barca would still win everything without him He makes the team so much better but they re a team full of world class players
You heavily underestimate how damn important Messi actually is for Barca He s not only a playmaker for them higher up on the pitch but the Argentine has took over the role Xavi had previously Cristiano on the other hand can t make an impact if he doesn t apepar on Livescore
I don t know how Messi s scoring record is relevant to this post or the comment you replied to The narrative here is he is not scoring goals in big games as much as he used to and he seems to be in a decline And I personally didn t see anyone else apart from you who have used your logic in recent days Correct me if I am wrong about it And it s not like there was any change to the players that feed him the ball from last season He used to score in the big matches with almost the same set of players last season too Ok maybe Rafa s tactics had something to do with it but he also hasn t yet set the league alight after Zidane took charge Maybe it s still early days into Zizou s tenure and yeah let s wait a while before claiming that his days as one of the top 5 footballers are clearly numbered
They have a very comparable team if you take Messi out of the equation I don t think Barca will be as dominant without Messi He is the x factor He is the person Barca turn to in big matches and he mostly delivers Look at the big matches last season CL semifinal and final Copa final Liga decider against Atletico He delivered in crunch times for the team
Everyone s talking about this season Suarez and Neymar especially have been the ones delivering those big moments If we re looking at entire careers or just a couple of years Ronaldo s consistently a big game player too Though you can t say Neymar and Suarez are top 3 players in the world on one hand and then say Barca s not so good If anything they were playing their best football those 2 months Messi was injured
Messi didn t dominate this weekend Messi Suarez and Neymar all dominated together
Neymar didn t play that well lol Messi and Suarez dominated
Neymar was shut down and Suarez did nothing bar the goal 2 shots 1 on target 0 dribbles 0 chances created 4 times dispossesed Messi decided the match as he has done many other times
Lol Messi was doing hell of a lot more than Neymar and Suarex last weekend don t know if you ve even watched the game
Messi had a great performance during that match I watched it myself and was better than Neymar or Su rez though they were great as well It s hard to quantify these things but as a matter of support for my point Messi did get the Man of the Match from WhoScored com and Mundo Deportivo readers poll also put Messi as the most decisive player in the match by quite a margin If you want further evidence just check the Post Match Thread on r Barca where the discussion normally doesn t include that much about Messi just to keep things broad Messi also came off the bench to score in the winner against At tico at Calder n at the beginning of the season the rest of the team couldn t break the deadlock I don t want to come off as putting down Neymar and Su rez who are amazing players and so is Ronaldo It s just to object to the point that Messi no longer makes a difference for Barcelona and he very much does
They played their best football those 2 months Messi was injured Barca has atleast 10 world class players if not more swap Messi for Ronaldo and they d still romp to the treble with Ronaldo top scorer and assister You re just the resident contrarian who shits on anything tangentially related to United England You ve been called out on your hypocrisy so many time in r reddevils it s hard to take you seriously anymore
i think barca is better atm but if we take the exact same teams and switch the two they ll be equal cuz ronaldo neymar suarez will be great and messi would be able to lift Bale and benzema up with his assists
I d like to agree you point that Bale is not far from being good in the same term as any of MSN trio although the Welsh is a fantastic player But you re wrong when it s about Karim Benzema In fact he s the best striker in the world alongside with Su rez and is responsable for a lot of Cristiano s goals at Real Madrid Something that even Carlo Ancelotti himself said once And I don t really see why you pick Isco who s the next big thing in Spain and leave out Modric And I could talk mention other world class player Madrid possess Real Madrid is one of the absolute best teams in the world maybe among top 4 so I don t really believe it s because of Cristiano has some poor team mates that you d like to describe Benzema and Bale having a great season statistically speaking and shows up against when it matter so I don t really think the problem lies on them but rather on Cristiano himself And forgive me if I sound harsh but you re an idiot if you think Barcelona wouldn t stop being dominant as they re now if Cristiano which we all know it s not gonna happened anyway replaced Messi I don t really know if you watch Madrid Barca games but it s more than obvious that Messi just more than scoring goals like the Portuguese only does The Argentine is the biggest reason why Barca are the best team in the world
LMAO proper big games you guys are hilarious Atletico Madrid Barca PSG are big teams that made Ronaldo invisible on the field
He could still score against barca in the clasico against atletico and in multiple CL games The season is far from over Statistics taken halfway thru the season cannot reflect the entire season If the season ends and all this holds true then come back and tell us Ronaldo is shit edit the man has played 2 games against Espanyol and Malmo only 1 game against atleti Barca sevilla valencia malaga celta bilbao and Villareal
Well you just refer to the season and you re comparing it to other FULL seasons which is invalid because this is half a season I am not making excuses I am just pointing out that this season isnt over edit season isnt over as in he s played the two 50 of goal teams twice while only 1 game against atleti Barca sevilla valencia malaga celta bilbao and Villareal
Just because he didn t score doesn t mean he was invisible He hardly did anything wrong against Barcelona and was really unlucky not to get a goal Bravo was having a night of his life He was also pretty decent against PSG and created some chances down the wing again I doubt you even watched those games it s all about the circlejerk bandwagon eh
But those are the moments and matches that defines a great player That is the moment when a great player drags his team across the finishing line Messi against Bayern for example He took the game by the scruff of the neck and made his mark when it mattered the most
But Messi delivered against Sevilla Atl tico 2x Bilbao and Roma Cristiano on the other hand was dog shit against top 6 teams in La Liga PSG
So what about the games against Villarreal Sevilla Valencia Barcelona Atl tico and PSG were Cristiano failed to deliver Also he s never scored when Real Madrid was down with a goal
No he bangs in 5 per game against Barcelona Atletico Just like Messi always bangs in 5 per game against Real It s not that hard to understand Point is that fanboys on this sub always try to give stats that suit their narrative There s no real fact here He always had important goals but Real isn t rolling like it should against the bigger teams this season and fanboys like to use that to go nuts
Messi fanboys have been saying it for the past half decade
5 per game against Barca Atletico That can t be right
I d like to see goals per game by opponent Real plays Barca Athletico more often than other teams
If you are looking for explanation of the white and red teams a friend sent me this yesterday yes he s a Barca fan CR this season
2 games against PSG 1 against Barcelona Atletico Madrid Athletic Villareal Celta Vigo and Sevilla Against the top 6 in la liga and the only other challenger in Real Madrid s CL group Ronaldo has totaled 1 goal and 1 assist
Wow who are messi favorite teams to score against What does messi like for dinner or pre match meal What is his shoe size Is he better than Patrick bamford Does he plan to play under kloppSource is the journalist that first reported LVG as being MUTD s next manager He s gotten some predictions wrong but I feel like he s rather reliable Forgot his name easy to google if you care to Apparently Giggs and the rest of the class of 92 have a different vision for the future of MUFC than Woodward and the Glazers It s a touchy situation because making Giggs a manager will give the class of 92 more power within the club which he is trying to avoid It s just a rumour but in my eyes it s fairly plausible It s not a crazy rumour such as Messi Ronaldo to United
But he did pretty good at Barca B before so Celta Vigo could took that to their account when they hired him after Roma which then he deliver
He actually did well at Barca B then shit with Roma but then he did well again with Celta Vigo And now he s done amazingly well with Barca
We ve had an injury list that makes the bible look like a short story and a manager who s had to pick up a broken dressing room yet in the past few weeks we ve started to play the best football we ve played in almost a year I honestly don t know how we lost to Sporting we were totally dominant as we should have been Gary can t make Negredo put the ball in the net he didn t tell him to miss open goal after goal and who saw that coming given he d scored 5 goals in his past 6 games With the recent performances and the team returning to full fitness I m confident we ll easily avoid relegation In fact I m backing us to beat Barca in the copa You might not like Gary and we definitely should have had a more experienced manager to help mentor our young team but we re stuck with him So back him
If you see a Real Madrid Barca flair just assume American from the get go I live in Spain and nobody knows what the fuck Reddit is
Lol it so hilarious to watch everyone dragging Neville through the mud after 8 games as if ANY manager wouldve come into this mess of a club and made them into title contenders or something Like honestly Valencia havent been good for awhile they bring in a relatively inexperienced manager mid season and some of you expect him to turn Valencia into Barcelona I can almost guarantee Neville knows more about football as a whole than basically anyone that posts on this subreddit The jury is still out Neville could end up being a flop as a manager but thats to be seen AT THE VERY LEAST after a full season
We were 1 point away from 3rd place last season No one expects Neville to turn us into Barcelona but we expect a replacement manager to improve our game and get us back into Europe positions which has been the opposite Last time we got rid of a coach mid season his replacement beat Barcelona at Camp Nou
Yea but they were up against Barakaldo Granada and Las Palmas They just drew Barca in the semi finalsI ve watched a lot of Juve and I really haven t been that impressed especially for a system like Barca s
I can t speak for Barca but I have been satisfied with him Why did he leave you unimpressed
He d break your system but I can t even imagine how monstrous he d be off the ball with the likes of Iniesta and Messi threading it throughmessi is better
Messi is much closer than Ronaldo and any one else since Madonna for sure It s hard comparison to make though totally different eras Pele not playing in more competitive leagues etc
I don t know if you are joking but he has 33 hat tricks for Barcelona I have no Idea how many he has for Argentina but I highly doubt it s more than 5
That s very likely true but Real have spent an immense amount of money on players over the last 15 20 years If they d focused more on building a coherent balanced team and less on shirt sales perhaps they d have competed with Barca better
Not sure any team competes with Barca better these last 10 years it s been a freak generation
A circus team really because we ve had a bad year with a few fuck ups I find that funny coming from a Milan fan What about Barcelona Neymar is being investigated for tax fraud assets frozen in Brazil Messi is going to trial Mascherano admitted being guilty in a tax fraud case Sandro Rosell and Bartomeu have been indicted over Neymar s case Had to give an orgy to sign Neymar etc Bayern and the majority of big clubs have a lot of shit going on too
If we had to face against Barca for most our trophies every year we wouldnt have been as successful
Well if Chelsea had been playing against arguably the best team of all time then I m sure you guys wouldn t have won any league titles Barcelona have been just a little bit better every time last season we were just two points off We have been more consistent than Chelsea in the Champions League and in the league We haven t dropped to 15th or been eliminated by a 10 man PSG have we We have a balanced squad we re just not playing a balanced starting XI
Oh they have numerous failed big signings I m referring to players like the aforementioned Cahill Ramires Mikel Malouda ect Excellent players in their own way but not Madrid Barcelona Bayern signings
Yeah but come on as every one else said you cannot discount the fact that they are up against this barcelona side That s a huge factor I m sure no other club in the world would have won more than Madrid have in the same league as Barcelona and so I m not sure you should discount that Ronaldo is the centerpiece of all Madrid have achieved The year that Atleti won the league was the year they won a champions league which is by no means a bad end
It definitely did matter we were a man down with our other CB off injured facing attack after attack from Barca that final goal allowed us to breathe and killed off the game
i d say it says more about barca tbh
I wouldn t deny the brilliance of Barcelona But Real have achieved as much against them as Atletico in the same period despite investing so much more in the team That is my point
Helps Madrid end a 12 year drought in the Champions League by being their top scorer in the competition and requesting to play in the final even though he was injured and unfit All these goals and he only won the two most important titles against arguably the best Barcelona of all time hurr durr Do you enjoy being the bottom comment in all Ronaldo threads today or are you just baiting Poor effort either way
Sure but it s just a matter of time before Messi surpass him
I misread and thought you re talking about his CL goals from 2013 14 season But as I said it doesn t really matter because Messi will be No 1 anyway
Cristiano has the most CL goals of all time sure but Messi will eventually become the new leader as the latter is younger than the Portuguese I don t really think it s the teammates fault why Real Madrid doesn t win titles and it s down to Cristiano They ve a lot of talent that is wasted by trying to get Cristiano to score goals If anything the team will be better when he leaves And as a anti Madridista I m very afraid when that happened
Ask Perez because at this point I m sure not all the decisions when it comes to Real matches are taken by the manager It reminds me of years ago when Messi was played against Bayern despite clearly being unfit I don t think I ve ever seen him play as badly as he did that dayIniesta and Messi aren t Edit So I m downvoted just would like to know why Either I didn t understand the reference to Totti Lahm and Terry or I wonder what s the difference between Lahm and Iniesta Same age in their club since 12 y old The difference I can see digging more is Iniesta isn t born in Barcelona contrary to the other three Does that warrant being downvoted without answers I don t know
Messi was born in BarcelonaYea because neymars never looked world class outside of barca Oh wait
You know I seem to recall hearing a similar argument a few years ago along the lines of where will messi be when Xaviniesta are gone wonder what happened to that
I feel sorry for you A goal is a goal Thats what a striker is for I guess being a plastic barca fan you got too used to wonder goals from the MSN
And this coming from a Barca fan The irony
hmm not sure what league youre referencing could it be the premier league notorious for being dominated by the big 4 or la liga which consists of barca real atletico and everyone else or maybe ligue 1 aka PSG and co
I think Serie A is fairly more competitive than La Liga Ligue 1 or Bundesliga because of one reason even though Juventus has been dominating its financial power isn t as incomparable to its domestic rivals as it is for PSG Bayern Barca and Real Milan Inter Roma and on a smaller scale Napoli may not be title contenders right now but they are teams that have started investing recently after struggling for a bit and will eventually rise to the status of contenders The gap between PSG Bayern etc and the rest of the league is hugeI don t see Messi leaving Barca not even for Pep
It s not going to stop even when he is here Pep assess squad as he takes training for the first time Pep shares birthday cake with Toure Yaya definitely staying Pep conference on why Toure was sold Guardiola s first win shows promise Guardiola s first loss shows which players need to be replaced Guardiola s disappointed with Sterling considers buying Messi to replace him MAN CITY TO AUDACIOUSLY BID 2 6bn FOR MESSI Metro City lose two games in a row Guardiola gets backing from owners Guardiola sacked as City only finish second in the league and lose in the CL final to an offside goal
English media love a messianic manager
Man City will be under a lot of pressure to perform at the highest level now If Pep doesn t have the same success at City that he s experienced at Barca and Bayern then the English press will destroy him
As if Messi or Neymar would even want to leave Barca why would they They re winning everything with ease and are playing in a team that already allows them to play their free flowing football
I don t see us signing anyone integral to the top three sides We ve been linked with some younger players at Barca who might prefer starting under Pep to fighting for a spot at Barca and there are always the rumours about Isco coming to City but we re not about to sign Neymar or M llerBarcelonaThe more people blame Hugiain for everything the less people will realize Messi deserves just as much of the blame
Yes but he isn t the only guy who was shit for Argentina Aside from Messi everybody on that team was painfully mediocre during the World Cup and Copa America and yet it is Higuain who I always see scapegoated on here by everybody
If you talk to an Argentinean they will tell you how much they hate messi as well How he doesn t put his heart into the national team how he doesn t do enough for them Really pathetic
The team wasn t mediocre The defense and midfield were built to perfection but the offense was just set up in a way that it couldn t keep up with the rest of the team Higuain and aguero put themselves in some incredible positions but neither could ve done much with the chances they were given Messi was overworked and should ve realistically gotten out with a golden boot but he hardly capitalized on any of them People will keep blaming Higuain sure but Measi deserves just as much blametbf Vermaelen has 1 goal in 16 appearances for Barca so he is in fact scoring more than 1 in 29
Yet won a treble with Barcelona
Ofc not Its an impure goal didn t we learn from Cristiano and Messi
