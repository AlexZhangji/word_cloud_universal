Every time there is a balance patch I get nervous and almost every time I am happy with how blizzard handled it So glad they didn t do the spore nerf
Thank the lord I m not even a zerg player but I feel like the current spore is needed because of the lack of a good anti air solution from zerg and that hasn t changed since HOTS
In reality the nerf only impacts ZvZ but I am also glad it didn t go through DH showed a lot of variety in the ZvZ meta I thought
Mutas absolutely still have a place as a viable opener because ravagers can t actually hit well micro d mutalisks If spores were nerfed we d just have the old ZvZ meta which was muta vs muta slapfests It was fun to play for a while but when all the ZvZs were the exact same ling bane muta it gets a bit boring to play
Agreed
I play Z and I absolutely hate mutas I would have died if the spore was nerfed
Because Zerg had good anti air options in WoL D
The interesting thing here is how much this reminds me of BW Remember how if one of the zerg players went hydra lurker vs muta ling the korean commentators would go oh this matchup is pretty much over Here in LotV I have no idea what the outcome of such a confrontation would look like but the interesting issue remains alike and that is the hydras cannot be everywhere and meanwhile the mutas are darting in and out harassing anywhere and everywhere they can be
Mutad are already very viable in ZvZ don t know why they even tested it Happy it did not go through
Ya I love the feedback and the listening to the community It s way better than it was in WoL or HotS
hi bot
Wow that was fast And I m glad they re ditching the spore crawler change after we saw some great ZvZ muta presence this past weekend
That was pretty quick
Probably wanted to give pros a heads up so the ones going to IEM Taipei had a chance to adjust
and winter regional qualifiers
True though those are already going on
The ones that are ongoing only have like 1 2 matches left anyways I think
When will the patch go live on regular ranked ladder
They said the 28th in the Community Feedback
Well they promised that the patch was rolling out on the 28th in the last community update There would have been hell to pay if they failed to roll out a patch on or before then
I m a little worried about PvZ it s really tough to hold Zerg all ins But we ll see I guess it might just mean we have to play differently
Pretty much it boils down to the same opener I ve decided where you build 4 phoenix to stop muta and then non stop build immortals and upgrades until you get to the lategame
Dont immortals get wrecked by hydra What kind of supply you aiming at before transitioning Zerg here so not familiar
Depends If you scout roach hydra then you start producing heavy on ground army If you scout air you mass more phoenix before transitioning I usually tech to storm archon either way so my comp can fight almost anything including an ultra transition Pretty much you gotta see if the zerg is going to base all in or try to play a macro game with you
Awesome cheers So I assume you open single stargate phx and robo after third depending on what you scout Also what would your ratios of phx void zealot adept archon templar immortal disruptor be against a zerg who seems to be going roach hydra but isn t clearly committing to a big allin e g more relevant in the lower leagues they re building an army and taking bases and could decide to allin pressure at any moment Finally if you playing 2v2s against a Z T team how would the composition change assuming zerg is roach etc t is bio Thanks in advance for sorry for the question spam I m decent as Zerg diamond but got NFI how to play Protoss coherently short of mass sky or random yolo troll styles
Double stargate usually but thats considering you get phoenix harass in I ve been opting for a couple of adepts early on for base protection and securing fast thirds Adept harass can really help you gauge how strong they are and their composition Honestly if you can buy time mass voidray and carrier is really strong It takes 3 bases though and if they all in you have to micro your early void oracle really well They key to beating ravager all ins though is lots of immortal production You could just assume the opener is 2 star 2 robo twilight temp tech tech The build I was following was from a progame I can t recall who He opened double star and then stalker
Thanks again How would you get upgrades on 2 3 base with this Also how many gateways you aiming for on 2 or 3 base to support this
I add gates depending on my composition More gates for heavier ground army Keep adding gates when you get into the lategame for better remax Usually try to grab 3 attack and some air upgrades for lategame The 3 ground is so when you remax after a big fight you can make a ton of archons and your ground army will be very tough This is strictly PvZ though
Perfect thanks
Ultras are terrible units vs chargelot archon immortal The real problem is trying to kill a defensive Z before broodlords get out because pushing into good defensive lurkers is really hard which is good otherwise Z just straight up dies to chargelot archon immortal before broodlords
But hydra get wrecked super hard by storm and disruptors one of which you should have before the hydra numbers get out of control
wow you may not be able to triple expand riskless
as a bronzie i think i should shut up about this
If Trump can run fro president you can damn sure shout Bronzie opinions from the fucking rooftop Go for it young Terran
I THINK ADEPT SHOULD GET MORE DAMAGEEEEE I will leave now
pvz is going to be frustrating
PvZ is already frustrating
True
I hope the next step is toning down Ravager Bile I d love to see what a casting range decrease would do and PvZ could be in a good spot
I think a damage reduction vs buildings would be a nice change especially in a ZvP
I don t care about ravagers lurkers is a pain in the ass I think it should be Hive tech
Thing is in tournaments there s not a lot of games where lurkers look un manageable disruptors shit on them Making ravagers slightly less strong against protoss could have a snowball effect that makes everything that come after more manageable anyways which often happens when tinkering with early game units
I guess that sounds reasonable
Then every zerg would die to a 3 base charge archon immortal protoss push in every game It is litterally the only thing that allows zerg to survive to hive
And they re fucking awesome I switched to zerg in LotV for 2 reasons it s the only race I haven t hit masters with and lurkers are badass as fuck If they take away lurkers I have to go back to being an all in protoss or a whiny terran C
You should seriously try phoenix into chargelot archon immortal It shits on Lurkers especially if the Zerg is attacking with them Phoenix can lift up Lurkers and archons immortals destroy them as well I face this all the time in KR and it s strong Stalker disruptor not very good versus it imo
Might as well make it a melee ability then Damage nerf is be better I think
Current range is 9 that s huge There s room for toning it down without making it short
Can you shorten the bile range without making the Ravagers a useless counter to well placed Liberator harass
That s an issue yes ravagers are needed to defend against liberators but when the roles are reversed and the ravagers attack they just shit on libs and tanks
So long as ravagers are the only viable counter to liberators until T3 then they absolutely cannot be nerfed in any way
They can t do this because of liberator range ie bunny s build The only way for zerg to deal with liberator range is ravager bile or air units It s poor design for liberators to force a zerg to go air tech when that is not their tech path of choice
Vs ranged liberator cheese openings that can t be scouted no range 9 is fine
I always thought the bile CD would be the best way to tone down the ravager You keep the ability to defend against libs and you can still kill them with the same number of biles when they harrass but they re more manageable later on
That makes a lot of sense actually would like to see them try something like this
I personally think a small casting delay on Bile would be nice
The longass delay before damage isn t enough
Yeah these nerf ravager posts are completely moronic There is literally zero pro players complaining about Ravagers They are simply not a problem I guess I could throw up a Terran flair and start whining about tank nerfs or something too
They can t do this because of liberator range ie bunny s build
Make it less stackable If you can t oneshot Pylons now the PO nerf won t matter that much for defending allins In big fights you mostly spread them out anyway
I love the comments Terrans complaining that their race is broken and weak protoss saying that this nerf will kill them zergs saying that the PB nerf will make them die to air so in a nutshell every race is UP and OP at the same time
Schroedinger s Race
Brilliant
So nothing new
The thing is all of these things are kind of true Terran have been suffering from a pure balance standpoint Their win rates are low in both matchups and PvT is downright frustrating for them All the changes in this patch should give them some more room to do their thing which is good Protoss have been relying on heavy Photon Overcharge usage to counter the strength of Zerg all ins and general economic harass And heavy Adept pressure to limit the army advantage of Terran in the mid game I see it as taking away stilts from the 5 6 guy in a basketball game Sure the stilts were unfair but now he s a fucking 5 6 guy in a basketball game Zerg still struggles with air compositions even with the power of PB which could outright cause other players to not use air in their compositions In the end all of these changes are GOOD changes because they were little bits of too much making up for other flaws But now we get to see the other flaws and hopefully it ll all shake out for the best
Only one of these races has data support for the UP position
Not at the same time At different times or rather at different stages of a game Against different matchups
Damn Well I guess we don t need the TvZ ZvP TvP show matches if this is going live If Blizzard is still looking at potentially adding the spore change I have Snute and TLO willing to do a ZvZ show match this week I ll keep ya ll posted
I don t know possible it is but it d be great if you could get it out before patch probably not possible im assuming it hits tomorrow morning during maintenance A lot of people are iffy on the spore change
I d still be interested in the PvT and PvZ to see how the changes have affected those matchups
Can blizzard please acknowledge the Disruptor aggro bug Are they even aware of it
Pretty sure they re aware but it s under not game breaking well get to it eventually
PvZ be prepared for the return of the Skytoss
Did carriers get buffed Don t they still take 90 years to make Bomb really never did much to carriers
No buff to carriers still too long of a build time and still not viable in most circumstances
I have been experimenting with going carriers in every game so far I can get to high M with em but it s really difficult
Shouldn t you bomb the interceptors
You cannot cast parasitic bomb on the interceptors themselves anymore if that is what you meant
Ah it was too strong I m guessing
same reason why BCs are not used
I doubt skytoss will return
Should just release on the 26th for everywhere except Korea where they can release it on the 28th like planned due to matches
It really is a drastic change Playing with mutas vs the nerfed spores was amazing since you could actually harass with a reasonable amount of mutas Defending it was pretty difficult Mass queen seemed to do well but I feel that leaves you open to mass expanding or passive transitions I don t think it s the right change when mutas are as strong as they are now I also don t like that the spore hard counters them as hard as they do but it seems necessary
Really excited for the viper change I still enjoy a heavy muta style and or late game 40 muta switches 60 dmg parasitic bombs means you need more than 2 bombs ticking on each muta every tick in order to kill any one of them Before it was only 1 1 2 bombs making a 2 parasitic bomb hit nearly impossible to prevent muta s death By the time you pull out the 2 mutas they all still die haha Now if I pull back after 2 bombs go off they ll all live if 3 I ll still may have time to keep the rest majority of my flock alive Also can t wait to basetrade protoss again Nothing more frustrating than having an 150 supply army lose to 8 Pylon Overcharges and a warp in Looking forward to the patch
Or your scouting overlord dying to a pylon and that being a good use of energy
depending on the timing and what toss scouts out of the zerg still a good use of energy
I played a ZvZ where I was behind in muta vs muta but managed to sneak out 4 vipers with PB I was more mineral starved than gas starved I guess I figured out afterwards that ended up being about 2 3 vipers more than I actually needed to turn the tide in my favor Since the damage stacks it creates crazy overkill potential If you force a muta vs muta fight and can land PBs then even if they split they are probably taking mutas out of the fight and cause a favorable engagement for the person without PB even if they are significantly behind in mutas I think that s why the even though the damage change is heavy it is still going to be a really powerful spell you still need to split and that even perfectly splitting takes away a lot of your advantage at least for mutas which don t have a lot of range For the majority of players who probably can t split well enough anyway it will at least tone down how ridiculously fast it can melt an airball
Should be a good iteration of the game I m interested in seeing how tvz and tvp develop after this and the potential liberator nerf that might be needed
That s not how it works 1 less damage from the Adept is a really REALLY big deal because it passes the Marine HP breakpoint Saying build 1 more Adept and it s the same is completely wrong because this statement assumes your Adepts put out a concentrated stream of DPS ignoring break points and overkill Currently a Marine without combat shields has 45 HP and an Adept does 23 damage per shot In two shots the Adept kills the marine 46 dmg to 45 hp After the patch an Adept does 22 damage per shot Two shots only does 44 damage leaving the marine with 1 HP This is a BIG DEAL it requires a whole extra shot to kill the Marine If we are considering a pure Adept army vs a pure Marine army the Adepts just got 50 less effective they take 1 5x as much time to kill the marines as they used to So the DPS of the Adept might only have gone down a tiny bit but because it passes the Marine HP breakpoint it s a huge effect
Don t forget it also needs 3 shots for an scv now
ya i think its appropriate though not everything should hit like a DT
Also keep in mind upgrades With 1 attack the adepts will be as powerful as they are now However none of the current adept early pressures have 1 So this is basically an early game adept nerf that will deal with warp prism or regular gateway pressure plays Those plays will still be good in the mid game once you have 1 but it should be easier to defend for T because you won t have to lose SCVs earlier
That s what im saying I quoted the first comment from the battle net forums
Also stim now hurts more than it helps for marine vs adept until you have combat shields
Yeah because units deal big chunks of other units HP in damage this is why slight HP buffs are such a big deal Even if the health gained or in this case damage lost is not much compared to the previous number the amount of shots required to kill the unit on the other hand makes a big difference This is why CS is such a big deal For instance lets say you re fighting Banshees A banshee needs two shots to kill a marine but three to kill a marine with combat shield Despite gaining slightly more than 20 more HP the marine is 50 more resilient in this case so it s almost equivalent to the marine getting 50 more health for all intents and purposes Roaches are another exemple the take 3 shots to kill a marine or 4 with CS so it s a 33 survival increase Hell DT are probably the most extreme case they take two shots rather than one shot meaning marines have a doubled effective health So in the end it really isn t about how much the numbers have changed but about their practical effect in a combat scenario That 1 damage difference effectively makes marines 50 tougher in the early game where the adept is problematic but it has a negligible effect in late game confrontations where the adept is fine
and it was all about the SCV s I really hope that Protoss still is able to trade cost efficent with a terran without the need to rush tec Terrans will always have the mobility let us have the efficiency
The time of us having cost efficency just ended Back to needing to rush tech or timings
In mid late game they will still need 3 shots to kill shield marines anyway This nerf mostly affects early game
Actually it still makes a difference with shields since right now adepts will 2 shot marines with shields if they stim It only stops mattering after 1 if the Terran does not have better upgrades
To be more specific 1 damage will allow Adepts to 2 shot Marines unless they have 2 armor this scenario should never happen unless a Forge was sniped while upgrading 2 damage will always 2 shot stimmed no shield Marines regardless of upgrades
After the change 1 damage on Adept does not allow them to 2 shot a Marine with 1 armor The only way an Adept returns to its 2 shot status is if Toss is ahead on upgrades If they re even the Marine takes 3 shots Edit Wait I think I m wrong Adepts get 2 damage against light for each upgrade Disregard
Yeah adept damage will be 10 12 and upgrades will stay 1 1 Darn tricksy protosses
The change only really affects Adepts until they have 1 attack at which point they will be able to 2 shot the same things they do now It s an early game change only But just like saying just get 1 more adept saying just get 1 attack is missing the point of why this is a huge change as you say Early adept attacks are currently strong because they can do things with ONLY 2 adepts and WITHOUT a forge
From what I ve read in analysis this effect disappears the moment protoss researches 1 ground weapons Even if terran researches 1 armor Both for marines and scvs So this is mostly to curb down adept all ins including the prism all in as it would require 1 to reach the same effect and thus be delayed and map control to some extent
I m just going to add in that this change only affects the adept marine relationship before any upgrades except adept attack speed Once adept get 1 attack upgrades they ll two shot marines Once marines get shields they will die in 3 shots both pre and post patch
Yeah Adept can get 1 attack but Terran can get 1 armor As for shields marines will still die in 3 shots but if they ve been stimmed they STILL take 3 shots to kill previously only took 2 Gotta consider all the upgrades coming into play Edit I think I m wrong Adepts get 2 damage vs light with each upgrade Bummer for Terrans
It takes 2 armor to negate 1 I belive
i wonder if adding an oracle to adept pushes will be effective now It deals a constant stream of damage with its beam so potentially it can quickly kill off all the 1 hp marines scvs left after 2 shots from the adept
You ll have to add a stargate to the push which either means you re pushing with fewer adepts or later into a stronger defense and an opponent who hasn t faced as much pressure
In the mid game not much is altered A marine with combat shields needs 3 adept shots to kill Pre nerf and post nerf adepts will always take 3 shots to kill a combat shielded marine so mid game interaction is left mostly untouched They didn t nerf adept attack speed so 50 attack speed adepts will still do great against combat shielded marines in a straight on engagement It just won t be as one sided since marines after a stim back down to 45 health won t be easy prey The power of recent PvT builds also hinges on forgoing upgrades for more gateway units or faster tech since adepts do not benefit greatly from 1 attack Now getting an upgrade lead on a terran allows protoss to two shot workers a huge advantage considering how effective adept harass has shown itself to be
Exciting When does this fo live
You guys are sick Keep it up
Good to see that DK came to his senses and threw out the proposed spore crawler nerf Keep it up
I wish they d have tested adjusting the adept more I m still not convinced the damage was the problem In my opinion the mobility and vision of the shade was the problem
So Thor change and siege tank change from the table Raven
Not really up to date with sc2 Isn t this a pretty good thing
I hope the patch goes live today I have no motivation to play with the current outdated game
Has the mod been updated to this
Thank fuck they didnt include the spore nerf I wasn t looking forward to pure muta vs muta especially the whoever rushes muta the fastest wins kind Rest looks good though
protoss is gonna get shat all over in tvp The matchup was broken on both sides but blizz only fixed one Liberator ghost armies are untouchable
If thats the case it will be patched too Also liberator ghost is probably one of the most expensive things I can think of for terran
I m not talking pure liberator ghost I just mean 4 10 liberators and 3 ghosts with a bio ball This is a composition you can comfortably get off of 3 bases and if the protoss does not have tempests they hardly ever can win a fight
Liberators in general are so frustrating for protoss in the lower leagues If you don t have air units ready good luck being able to shoot them with stalkers By the time you get void ray phoenix they get shut down with marines
Everything is frustrating for lower leagues
You re right It s a brutal frustrating game but that s why I like it Starcraft is not for casuals Things like muta switches or endless bio drops are understandably frustrating but nothing makes me rage like having a liberator sitting behind your mineral line out of pylon range when the only AA you have are a few stalkers that can t reach it without getting obliterated
Nah man flying my factory in their base building Mines and then killing all his workers is not
GG PvZ This is a disgrace
Im toss and i really like this changes from a design point of view The only thing that i dislike is that it forced us to double stargate pretty hard And i hope we can do somethign about that in the future
Man i am scared i am a protoss player and i always have trouble with speedlings until i learned to proper position my pylons and use PO but now that we have half of charges i think zerg can abuse it pretty easily with his unit mobility
Did you play Protoss in WoL A mistake in building placement or unit hold position was an auto loss Man I switched to terran at the wrong time
Has the patch been relased yet
Glad they don t plan to implement the spore change I hope they look at tanks next TvT is killing me So this patch comes out on thursday
damn I can already taste protoss tears welling up
Don t worry we ll be downvoted to oblivion by anti protoss bias until we get more nerfs We re near 40 in ZvP and this pylon overcharge nerf is going to make Roach Ravager pushes insanely stronger Pylons are so easy to snipe with corrosive bile and now that it costs 50 energy we re super fucked I hope you like the taste
i still think it s blizzard s fault for coming up with attacking pylons they are stuck with it and so they are desperately trying to make it viable
That is the story of Protoss in Starcraft 2 Forcefield and MsC have been band aids for poor design
Protoss is definitely the worst race design There has always been the massive problem of defenders advantage with protoss because the game is balanced around warp in mechanics Terran has longest range units and sim city for their defense and zerg has creep and queens Protoss always just had to make due with whatever quick fix blizzard gave them forcefield and msc
I completly agree about the original sin about the defender advantage But since LotV where the warpgate has been finally strongly nerfed you could have strong gateway units again like in BW I m dreaming of a world where pylon overcharge and force field disappears completly as they are bad design And they could buff gateway units gets as a tradeoff That was not possible because of warpgate before but now they can do it
They did buff gateway units Look what happened
They didn t buff any of the existing gateway units They added a gateway unit that is really strong with the buffed warp prism They buffed a midgame zealot upgrade That s it Stalkers still suck Zealots are still weak early Sentries take all of your gas and are useless because of the buffed shooting pylon
I agree with everything you said My point is that the adept buffed gateway centric play and now they are scaling it back a bit
Gateway centric aggressive play Adept gateway still sucks shit at defending early vs roaches or marauders without overcharge
would you trade your MC for a shield battery just curious
I honestly think that instead of PO Pylons should grant a bonus to either shield armor and or shield recharge while a protoss unit stands in their power field I mean zerg has home field advantage with creep terran can set up really good simcity defenses but PO allows defense with basically no units shouldn t defense imply actually having units to defend
sim city can be used by all races though zerg use evo chambers to funnel hellions and toss wall off the natural for fast expo that being said im not against the PO changing to buff units as it still means toss has to scout and have actual freaking units rdy to defend
P and T simcity are for two different things T simcity is to allow seigetank liberator to poke from max range P simcity is only about controlling zerglings and new in LOTV maximizing pylon surface area at the front
First time I ve seen that suggested but it s really good idea actually Get rid of photon overcharge and give pylons an automatic shield recharge ability to units and buildings in its radius Encourages the protoss to build units to defend rather than just rely on cheap abilities
Even if you did that Protoss would get shit on by early all ins To make the pylon shield recharge ability viable early game it would be broken mid and late game
If it was strong enough then sure It would have to be comparable strength to like bunkers which are insanely strong due to repair and low commitment due to salvage
That s debatable since pylons also give supply If you need PO to activate this hypothetical buff then sure but if it s passive it might be stacking up to 5 or so but not too strong
The people who downvote only due to race are idiots Anyways the problem wasn t pylons when an attack comes to the front door with ravagers it s that protosses can sit in their base with the MSC and be perfectly safe from any counter harass A zerg run by usually only consists of 10 20 lings or 5 or so roaches which get murdered by pylon overcharge A 5 zealot run by requires 6 8 roaches to deal with proper micro Obviously some races should excel at things better than others but permanent overcharge safety wasn t fun and offered little to punish protoss for moving out Unfortunately while this nerf helps with that like you mentioned it s going to make the actual pushes harder to defend and the only thing I can think of is to change bile to 50 damage vs buildings
What I am worried about is how this will affect early liberator strategies that often depended on photon overcharge to defend it unless you just went stargate first Liberators tuck themselves in a corner so they only target 2 mineral patches but that is enough to make it very hard for stalkers to defend it on some maps
Or maybe use the great insight you mentioned All defense should require unit control of some kind Currently the all purpose PO can be used defensively or offensively because of the way the MSC works This unit was put in the game to give protoss some early game poking potential against zerg by privaledge of recall Poke a bit do some dmg or threaten to do so then recall back and turtle It was pretty elegant but still not enough Then overcharge debuted and essentially filled that niche twice Now that the WP and adept have stepped into the meta it is aparent that protoss can have some potency without recall but still requires PO Its a bit of a shame that the WPadept meta couldnt develop more and somehow seek some balance But the reality is that it in combination with PO limits terran far too effectively to stay unchanged I welcome the nerf and hope that it allows terran and toss to have more than 1 strat in this MU The question remains though can toss defend against zerg w o PO I don t think they can unless their offense becomes their defense I think that PO being nerfed gives toss the window to show blizzard how we can utilize the race defensively without need of the spell with units and strong micro but simultaneously dread the thought of more losses vs the very potent rorava timings I would like to see in the future of protoss PO removed from the game entirely the zealot and the stalker to recieve an early game utility buff to compensate and for stasis trap to become a more interesting keystone in how protoss pull off defense I sort of wish the sentry took a stronger role as a defensive unit also That at home it had some fortifying ability that helps preemptively defend against drops Such as the sentry can recall a unit to its location Spell is channeled and cancelled with dmg Being in a power grid makes it cost half the energy per unit Maybe scale the energy cost per unit type 1 4 energy for gateway units 3 4 for a robo unit So effectively 5 6 sentries could recall a majority of protoss army Units being recalled are vulnerable and immobile At least then toss has the ability to push and defend with units that need micro and cost money and a spell that needs foresight Moreover multiple sentries at each base gives the protoss the flexibility to fortify all 3 bases or just 1 base depending on the kind of drop instead of slugging an MSC to the drop sight then following the inevitable carnage It also requires good scouting which IMO should be the best and most reliable way to subdue incoming harassment Lastly offensive sentries could be used to refortify an army after a succesful defense but would lose all of their energy in doing so which makes them effectively dead weight in a fight
Yeah they get murdered by pylon overcharge but that s because the protoss army is slow as balls and won t be able to home and defend in any realistic timeframe While the zerg has a queens a creep network and fast units the protoss only has warp in which got nerfed And since gateway units are kinda shitty it makes perfect sense that protoss needs a bit more help dealing with harass
That pylon overcharge buys plenty of time for the protoss to get back to the base especially when the MSC has full energy
Yes that s my argument Pylon overcharge is necessary to buy time
its sad but true with corrosive bile hitting buildings this is gonna be a pain to hold
Yep it feels like Stargate will be the go to opener in pvz That s assuming it s not a 1 base Roach ravager rush which I m not sure how strong that will be if at all
Still won t be as much as T whines with a positive winrate
not sure how T can whine any more since adepts are nerfed how adepts destroyed bio was the biggest problem but now it s over T is very strong now
Wait one week
optimist I see
T never stops whining Even when T has a 70 winrate in TvP and TvZ then T whines that they play too much TvT
8 armor Ultras are still sick against Terran
yeah but so are liberators against mutas all races need some OP shit
I m barely seeing anyone acknowledge the adept change I m assuming that s because terran will still need something to complain a out after they lose
Warp prisms will be the next gripe
They took their time but I think these are the balance changes that most people wanted
regarding the overcharge 15 seconds 1 25 attacks per second 12 attacks each attack is 30 damage so 12x30 360 total damage its 360 damage for 25 energy or 360 25 14 4 damage per energy for the new version just copy the numbers except 20 seconds and 1 25 becomes 1 to get 600 50 12 damage per energy by the numbers that means its nerfed in damage but not very much 2 damage per energy and its not as spammable that makes this far more strategic since now you can t spam 7 overcharges and defend a large roach attack with a handful of adepts lets see the roach pushes boys edit of course this doesnt reflect on being able to run and hold out the overcharge which is now less spammable this change could be big but its good now you cant 3 base and tech up so easily
Well 3 base and tech up easily got us up to around 40 in PvZ Now let s the where that goes
I think the most important note is that pylons are easily snipeable with ravagers I predict PvZ being even more zerg favored in the near future
It s Likely it will be for the first month 6 weeks but i think this is a very good step towards balancing if this nerf proves to be to much they can look into buffs elsewhere to hopefully bring Protoss back into line that said i am pretty sure what we are gonna see is a meta shift into more unit based defensive builds with a msc for back up as opposed to the reverse which is exactly where we are atm especially now that this change opens toss up to more harassment through drops banshees muta and the like which imo is a good thing for everyone
Yeah this is basically certain
We need a way to buff pvz without affecting pvt
I don t think the Spore change and the viper change should be put in around the same time As much as I like playing muta styles I say let s see how the meta is after the Viper nerf before we decide to re nerf the spore
there s no need to nerf the spore it s already weak the biggest advantage of the muta style is the mobility even with todays spores you need quite a lot of them otherwise they will just be focused down pb nerf is ok imo
Can someone please explain the difference between duration and weapon period I m unsure what the difference is between the two
Duration is how long the overcharge is active on the pylon Weapon period is how much time is between each attack
Weapon period would make more sense being called attack delay
Ohhh ok interesting Thank you

Whatever happened to the proposed change to reduce or remove the Disruptor shot s bonus shield damage
They seem pretty sensible changes adepts don t two shot scvs photon overcharge can t wipe a whole army and parasitic bomb isn t quite so crazyamazing I am so happy to read this
Happy will be happy too D

That s true but it s important to take criticism srsly and see how legit it is instead of just undermine the brought up point with sentence like oh you re just so neagtive Positive and negative feedback should be valued equaliy to learn from them to make Starcraft and our Scene a bit better with each change Well h just in my opinion
Very good point of cause the already qualified shouldn t be participants
This is awesome The ladder needs work but when it s working as intended and people are using it to qualify for stuff the quality of practice for foreigners should improve dramatically
My only concern is hackers and win traders We all need to put on our Avilo faces and report any suspicious activity Kappa
Well in the top 16 GM I think it would be very obvious when the guy will come to the tournament
But would be taking the spot of a deserving person which is not ideal
hacking could also accure in the regular qualifier I don t see how the risk is higher with the new ESL ladder format
Ye if anything the risk is lower Maybe you can go through a qualifier bracket hacking Being consistent around the top 16 all the time playing against the best without being caught Not so much Also I can t really imagine someone dumb enough claiming a spot hacking and actually taking it If this goes wrong he would probably lynched live but no way a decent amount of time of his life wouldn t be fucked As the internetz doesn t fuck around with persons like this with repercussions to RL
Just ask Lilbow what happens when you utterly bomb at a live event
Occur
Thank you
That s true but i think boosting and wintrading would be a bigger problem I can remember how Destiny did something similiar like ESL now and caught someone wintrading I mean it s still amazing but you have to observe the matchhistory of the players carefully
Not only would he be taking a spot he would be stealing at least 400
I think if he gets banned due to hacking he won t be given that money
It s true Maybe they ll enforce their security test for these players And they did it just after a patch too so i think most hacks are broken again
Yes yes yes yes this is fucking awesome this is the best WCS update I ve seen yet holy shit
brb ladder
Imagine if they did this for KR too I can t fathom what the KR ladder would look like without barcodes
One day maybe
IT STARTS TODAY Big changes are coming for the 2016 WCS Challenger For the first time in StarCraft II history the WCS will utilize the in game ladder to determine 2016 WCS Challenger qualifier slots for the WCS Circuit Winter Championship Not only that but top finishers can also look forward to cash prizes from a US 10 000 prize pool based on their performances How it works The ladder competition will start today February 1st and will last until February 12th 12 00 am PST for America and 12 00 am CET for Europe Once concluded the top sixteen EU and NA ladder players will be invited to a regional double elimination tournament run by ESL where they will compete for the following prizes 1st place US 1 400 direct qualification to the WCS Circuit Winter Championship 2nd place US 1 200 direct qualification to the WCS Circuit Winter Championship 3rd 4th place US 800 5th 8th place US 600 9th 16th place US 400 The double elimination tournament is set to take place from February 13th to 14th to provide the winners ample time to acquire the necessary travel documents for the trip to the Winter Championship in Poland The following rules apply for the WCS Ladder qualifiers Players will be required to play under the name that they wish to use during the WCS Circuit Winter Championship A free character name change was provided to every account on January 29th Players must have their Battle net account registered to one of the eligible countries or submit other proof of citizenship or residency to esportsteam blizzard com ESL and Blizzard will identify the top sixteen players in both regions at 12 00 am PST on February 12th The double elimination tournament seeding will work as following 1vs16 2vs15 etc All matches will be Bo5 The champion of the upper bracket will receive first place and the lower bracket champion will receive second place Players already qualified for the WCS Circuit Winter Championship at Intel Extreme Masters Katowice will be eligible to play in their Regional Challenger and the next eligible player will be invited should they secure a first or second place For the North American Challenger tournament only residents and citizens of North America Canada U S will be eligible qualify These are only the first step with the new WCS Ladder qualifier format and ESL will work closely with Blizzard to optimize future competitions Best of luck

Great for the scene blizzard calling it
Yes yes yes yes this is the the best update I ve ever seen Blizzard do to SC2 holy fuck this is awesome
Oh wow this sounds pretty neat
You did it Totalbiscuit
Really excited for this
That sounds great Hopefully no top 16 players get locked out of GM due to it being full x
A realistic fear Polt and Neeb got locked out the second half of last season despite both having two of the best win rates
Yeah that s really annoying It was mostly due to the weird reset in the middle of the season Over the course of an entire season the best players almost always get in Neeb s win rate was completely absurd and probably would have made gm again if he kept playing on NA but it seems like he switched to other servers after the reset
Also just realized Neeb and Polt don t qualify for this since they already qualified for the Winter Finals so while they will ladder they likely won t have motivation to grind ladder
Well 400 just for being top 16 I don t see why they would skip this
Getting top 16 is a lot of work not in terms of skill but just the hours needed to grind that high especially for someone like Polt who isn t even in the country right now and won t be back for a few days
THey actually do qualify for this They can play both Basically they dont get the trip to WCS out of it but they still get the cash
I phrased it wrong you are right but they don t qualify THROUGH this instead the next person would take their spot Mostly I was saying it s not be as motivated especially someone like Polt who even the first place prize isn t significant Thanks for letting me clarify
Yeah as good as this sounds I feel like they jumped the gun a bit before they got new GM implemented from Ladder2 0 I feel like to get this to work they really need GM Masters to be a continuous stream of people instead of completely separate They also need to make the game hack proof but thats a bigger ask
This adds quite a few money spots and I ve updated my table but I am sad it s such a small spot considering these players likely would be earning 2 000 in the old Challenger format I am still really happy it s ladder centrist
Awesooome Good luck you ladder heroes
This is going to be a nice increase practice quality for heavy ladder players
Wow this is big news Basically what people have been asking for hopefully this becomes a regular thing for circuit events
WE FUCKING DID IT BOYS
Amazing
This explains why the ladder season end was delayed until February instead of early January Great idea
Would love if it would be for top 32 Its REALLY REALLY hard to get into top 16 in European ladder
would be much easier minus the maphackers
And the leave league sniping
Is that still not fixed I can t imagine having to get top 16 with that bug still being abused
In the latest community feedback they said they addressed many of the edge cases via hotfixes allowing this to happen but to completely resolve they require a for real patch I think to be pushed out From watching streams I m not seeing it happen all the time anymore
Bunny said same thing
Fair point and something we considered but scrapped afterall for Katowice because of the tight timeframe Definitely something to keep in mind for the future
For some reason I d like to see it happen for SEA too lol
I like that they re region locking the slots to the WCS Winter Championship but I hope that they wouldn t region lock the ladder tournament itself It would encourage players from other regions to play on the ladder and improve competition
this is so fucking awesome
This is fantastic news But I m a little confused at some points of the article Is this only for NA ladder This point For the North American Challenger tournament only residents and citizens of North America Canada U S will be eligible qualify has me confused And then if not is it the top 16 of NA EU combined Will that be the top 8 of each ladder respectively or will they take the ladder points and invite the top 16 in that regard
Yeah wording is terrible They also only mention the residency for NA players Does that mean EU is open to everyone
This is going to be ruined by hackers I hope ESL has a plan in place to be able to weed them out
hackers win trading multiple accounts System is going to be a mess
Blizzard just needs to investigate 16 accounts Should not be to hard to check for this kind of stuff Perma Ban from WCS for cheater Problem solved
more than that Its the top 16 and then those who replace them I mean other ladder qualifying events saw pros win trading in the past Blizzard needs to come down hard on abuse for this They have done some punishment in the past with hearthstone but it doesnt go far enough
ABSOLUTE BEST I DEA FREAKING EVARRRRRRRRR SwiftRage
This is fucking awesome And people whine towards blizzard that they doesn t do something What the fuck has Valve done for csgo except making skins Blizzard Valve
In contrast Valve has done much for Dota I hear their support for CSGO isn t great though
I m looking forward to the drama towards the end when people start accusing eachother of wintrading an sniping
A step in the right directon ty blizzard
so if people block gm spots with smurf accounts so better players can t get in this will not work out at all
TB did it before for ShoutCraft and it worked I don t see why it wouldn t work now
Temp0 time https www youtube com watch v SX1c07mPXqc
I m sure some kinks will need to be worked out but overall I find this to be a fantastic move At the very least aspiring SC2 amateur players have a clearly defined path to walk now to become pros at the game Get top 16 GM
There are downsides to this format and people who are already enumerating them are quick to jump the gun when they come true But this hindsight bias is only valid if you got the data to back it up which this experiment will provide
excellent news david kim i forgive u
just like i suggested like years ago in a reddit thread pad pad
YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This is incredible for many reasons How will they ensure no map hackers abuse this system I have some ideas but I m wondering what everyone thinks
They can t but they did recently make efforts to stop maphacks again and they seem to have some focus on it now
2 They won t
You can t be serious How could they not
You can t be serious How could they even do it
Well I m not sure I was hoping some discussion about options might occur here
How have they stopped maphackers before they haven t But if you maphack at top GM everyone knows who you are and has you friend noted as one so I m fairly sure it ll work just how it always worked in past qualifiers they will notify the tournament admins
I meant that more in a practical way I expect it will be very hard for them to prevent hackers getting through
Oh ok I m also concerned about that Maybe if they focus more anti hacking resources at the top 50 GM players the extra scrutiny can weed out anyone close to the top 16 Plus they could ban the accounts of hackers identified this way and it s pretty time consuming to rank up gain to GM even if it s just 20 30 games
I think it s safe to assume they already pay most attention to top level players it doesn t make a ton of sense rooting out goldy hack claims In the same vein I think it s safe to assume that Blizzard a billion dollar company has much more qualified people who have been working on issues like this for a long time and have more knowledge to apply to this issue than we do
So you think they will be able to deal with the hacker concern ps I hope they can
Haha I super duper hope they can too but I meant that in a more pessimistic way Hacking is tough to root out and as I understand it can t ever really be completely eliminated
How can it start today if GM isn t even open
Well they only check the top players when the time period ends whenever it officially starts makes no difference
This is exactly what is needed Good job all round
is the event online and is it top16 each server plays eachother or is all 32 players in and only top16 payout
It will be online and each region plays themselves so EU and NA won t face each other
BRINGONTHELADDERHEROES
This seems like a great idea
About time Just hope they fix the game ready bug because that will cause shittons of problems
So how well does the ladder work to decide the top 16 players of a region
don t know how well it works but I would still prefer a ladder on which you will be supposed to play lots of games to achieve top 16 which btw will become even more demanding than now with all the ladder heroes unchained in grinding thousand of games to make it than a fistful bo3s played online being exposed to most of the ladder related issues production tabs smurfs etc plus most of the guys that are indeed active on the ladder have a certain clue who the better players are so should some cheater maphacker nonamer make it to the top 16 that would put an insane pressure on Blizz shoulders to disqualify them or atleast to fix the cheats hacks better than they do currently
To everyone worried about map hackers getting undeserved wins remember map hackers are usually not good enough to compete at this level and map hacking can always occur in any off line tournament so it s not any different than any other tournament In addition hackers will have to play many games on their account to get to a high placement which makes them even more liable to get caught as opposed to being able to practice on a barcode and only having to qualify with a few games on a normal account
Did you actually mean to say map hacking can always occur in any offline tournament That would never be possible
Yeah tell that to Flusha Remember a pro who is really good can still decide to have something like a production tab hack to construct a small advantage for himself to win the game Your argument doesn t make any sense
You know Flusha cheating is a meme right like noone actually thinks he is cheating
Recently a lot of really damning evidence has come to light So no it isn t just a meme anymore
Latin America has the Copa America 40 000 tournament which does the same thing as this tournament only with more money and less players
Why does COPA america get 40 000 but EU and NA only get 10000
Copa America already existed had it s own sponsors and it s prize pool didn t get more money between 2015 and 2016 The NA and EU Challenger is an all new competition I am sad it s such a small pool since even the winner of the tournament gets less than an old Challenger spot but better than nothing
What happens if one person has two IDs in a pay out spot
Well considering you ll have to compete for the money I think they ll notice if you have two accounts when you might have to play yourself
This sounds awesome I also believe it s one small step forward to solving the barcode problem by requiring the players to register with their real ID in order to participate in this ladder Challenger
Does anyone know if other games csgo dota lol have a similar system and if so about how they deal with hacking
I can only speak of CS GO But CS GO has the worst matchmaking ever so many cheaters and it s pretty easy to be global elite highest rank after that it s no point in playing MM So all the serious players in csgo play faceit esea etc
So having tournaments decided by matchmaking wouldn t be considered in csgo I guess
Ladder matters this is so cool
I m going to start the over under at 3 5 confirmed maphackers any takers
Just how GM is not an option since you can t get into GM when it is full If they want to select the top players based on their MMR at season start then it will always be debatable without a single combined master league
Win trading hacking multiple accounts The ladder isnt going to work for this system Over under on how many people in the top 16 are going to get dq d
Blizzard ESL is not listening KappaI don t really care at this point You couldn t kill my passion for starcraft unless you killed me Match fixing doesn t scare me away
Seriously I enjoy watching Starcraft so godamnit that s what I do
I have tried watching other games from time to time to broaden my horizons It doesn t work CS is a fun game dont have time for it SC eats up all my game time but i also find it difficult to watch Dota is the closest game i could also watch but i don t understand it I get the broad concepts just too many details i don t know about Starcraft for me is a perfect game to play and a perfect game to watch
Not trying to not make you watch starcraft with this idea but you should try watching fighting games The 1v1 aspect of them really connected to me from a starcraft perspective when I started looking at that scene They also share some similar storylines Long history before the rebirth of modern Esport Broodwar days vs arcade days the rivalry between Asia and western countries for capcom games atleast and the idea of legendary players bonjwa vs the 5 Gods of Japan
totally agree i just love watching street fighter probably because of how diverse the personalities are in the FGC
The only physical sports i watch is Tennis Boxing if its a big fight MMA if i have the change and Snooker Street Fighter sounds great Easy to watch simple concept but intricate reaction based
Yep I love watching playing Smash Melee
1 to Melee I used to play so many games before college As an adult now Melee and Starcraft are pretty much all I have time to play and all I actually want to play
Agreed Smash is my second favourite game to watch Armada fo lyfe
I have found great enjoyment recently in watching fighting games Can t take that marvel vs capcom anime stuff cannot tell what is going on but street fighter or netherrealm games are awesome for me to watch Basically they share the strategy and realtime execution element with SC2 and the merciless 1v1 competition And you have those epic moments of this dude is a god which I don t normally get with other Esports than SC2 Trying to play MKX I can confirm that the barrier of entry is as high as SC2 though out of the 20 games I played I won 1
https www youtube com watch v V0EZobdiJ4M
Fuck yeah dude Long live sc2
Its true im old school though I played this game the first day it came out SC1 vanilla There was no scene and no tournaments Our love for the game comes from the game itself not from tournaments or internet popularity And their are millions others just like us
If I could handle the god damned maestro being involved in match fixing I ll get over this no doubt
The only thing that could take my love and respect for the korean competitive scene is if matchfixing wasn t properly punished If somehow people were hyped to see Yoda streaming or being allowed back into tournaments that s when I would lose the respect of the competitive game
Don t let a few people spoil your fun If those players come back ignore them and don t give them either attention or money Support people who deserve your support
I totally agree with you In CS GO a professional team match fixed and because they also are famous streamers everyone wants them to come back to the competitive scene Tbh that look so bad for the cs go scene tbh Hope the same thing doesnt happen to sc2
The people susceptible of losing their passion because of this have already quit the boat a long time ago SC2 today s fans left are the hardcore fans who will always remains fans no matter what
Even though I m new I love StarCraft and I shall stay here until the last professional SC2 game is played
I wonder what he meant when he said they had a hard time with SKT
It means SKT didn t to want to sponsor Pro League
No he is just acknowledging the fact that SKT is the main sponsor of Pro League 2016 and that their support was instrumental in keeping the tournament going
My life for StarCraft
Let s fight this Starcraft is too good a game it is worth it
Wasn t sure if I wanted to sub to the proleague channel because I am a poor college student but fuck it I want to support them and don t want to see proleague die
I think we should all strive to do our best to be a positive part of the community This doesn t mean we need to be naive about the current situation of the scene but negativity just becomes a downward spiral that achieves nothing other than harming the game more
The attitude change in this thread from just little over a day ago is so great I can hardly believe it Lets keep it up upvote good upvote bad discuss good discuss bad rejoice good and cry bad but always move forward
This is a natural consequence of being able to make better money gambling on SC2 than playing it You can say what you want about Life making the most money and thus not needing it but if the allegations end up being true you can bet your dick that plenty of B teamers were in on it as well Imagine doing well in minor tournaments and making a few hundred bucks while people make thousands off gambling on your match That doesn t excuse the behaviour of any individual at all but when you put a large number of people in that situation it really is not surprising that some will break
You will poorly always have matchfixing in any Sport We can always just continue and have fun with what we love and there is no reason not to do that My life for Aiur
That s not true and definitely not at the highest level
Well Life was for a looooong time at the highest level not sure when that changed
Highest level in SC2 means his making a fraction of highest level in another sport You couldn t have match fixing in a sport where the players are making 5 million a year It s why gambling used to be such a big problem for American sports see 1919 world series and isn t an issue at all currently The players just make to much for them to be bought by match fixers
You said we will always have matchfixing in any Sport I said that is a bullshit claim because it is not the case especially not at the highest level Which is what happened here with Life
So it sounds like SK Telecom was reluctant to continue their sponsorship of proleague because of alleged matchfixing by Life Just shows how much damage matchfixing can do to a fragile scene If he gets convicted he s dead to me I dont care fucking up so many honest people livelyhood and passion
The life news just came a couple of days ago and proleague had already been delayed for quite a while I think its more likely that SKT was just hesitant to put too much more money into the SC2 scene generally before the matchfixing came out
no I highly doubt they would have sponsored it now after the Life scandal Its much more likely that SKT just didnt see the sponsorship with the money
Time to start setting alarms to wake up so I can watch all of proleague
Remeber when Blizzard fought tooth and nail against KeSPA for the control of Korean SC2 When Blizzard thought they were going to profit Now look what happened KeSPA left holding up the scene themselves and what did Blizz do
Blizzard doesn t care about the ultimate fate of StarCraft in Korea They only cared enough about the short term profits of selling SC2 when it was new e Sport scene be damned to make it happen This is the result less tournaments than ever before the smallest Proleague than ever before fewer more reluctant sponsors the fewest amount of teams We ll see where the scene ends up in a year or two
I can t tell for sure if Blizzard cares probably there is already enough misinformed speculation on the topic but I guess KeSPA wasn t that reluctant to control the korean scene there was a lot of economical interest involved and from great powers come also responsabilities It is the same KeSPA that for example prevented PartinG from playing PL matches last year stripping PL of a big role model and damaging his team I m afraid region locks and WCS would have hurt korean SC still way less than the present scandal can do
It s sad this is the state of SC2 coming off the last expansion of the game Suppose to be the penultimate experience for Starcraft and yet it failed to generate any hype I seriously doubt Blizzard made much money from HotS and LotV and they have nobody to blame but themselves
My passion is always intact if not constantly rising matchfixing is a sad occurrence but it will take much more than that to damage my interest
Please ignore that corrupted 1 and protect the passion of 99 BibleThump
Honestly the Western audience seem to severly overestimate the role of KESPA They don t have half the power or resource some people blindly assume they have
dunno how it works in most countries but in Italy sport federations have very little power on that they can acquire documentation from state persecutors and run their own trials judgements but not much more than that Should their verdicts be overruled by the ones of state s tribunals they may even be compelled to cancel their sentencies Federations are limited both by the law privacy laws civil rights etc and by lack of financial means to pursue suspects and run independent investigations they almost totally rely on national persecutors but a standard trial takes ages to arrive at the final judjgement so sports are often found to be run sub judice We ve been having huge match fixing scandals in soccer in the last years that are making our league a sub par joke on the international scene still the Federation seems completely helpless and lacks independence If I had my way for our experience so far I would make betting completely illegal as it was when I was a kid and the only kinda betting allowed was a state monopoly
Isn t it more like the NFL or Olympic committee works in tandem with the government
It pretty much is exactly that Its more of a comitee than anything else with ties to with government
matchfixing is no joke
Regardless of what happens I will still love this game and the sceneI actually just randomly started to watch last years championship can someone explain the rules to me as far as i know unless all your nexus command centers hives drones scvs probes die Your still in it But these matches end completely random Atleast to me When the loser still has three bases i dont get it Eli5
Players will concede if they know they are too far behind to mount any sort of effective defense offense Your opponents entire army is in your base and you have no units to defend it s better to just concede instead of making them destroy every last building
Ok That makes since I guess in my non pro eyes it seems weird Ill just stick to my campaign and cheat codes and just enjoy the game I always got rekt lanning with my family so makes since Thanks for the logical information that i couldn t comprehend until guided to it like a child
I m surprised you have none of this information since you ve played the game with other people before
I only played with my family When i was in my teens And my family are assholes so my uncle who had a way better understanding of the game Would zerg rush me with 6 lings within minutes of the game and destroy my base and laugh his ass off while i was just trying to collect minerals I always loved protoss Mostly because i enjoyed playing by myself and you could build a base for all races in one scrimmage But when attacked i always tried to get a probe out and go hide and try to start a new base I love RTS games but ill never claim to be really good at them
Watch more pro matches learn how to play from them challenge your uncle and then defeat him
Haha that s funny Was it SC1 you were playing Part of why I got really interested in pro SC2 was that I had really fond memories of the older title Welcome to the sub
what a jerk
Players leave when they know they can t come back from critical damage Like if a massive army rolls over your massive army and you have 150 units less having four bases means nothing so they just leave the game because they won t come back
It is actually considered slightly bad manners if you run around the map trying to live when there is no way to actually win Like say floating all your buildings into nooks and crannys on the map or making half built supply depots everywhere so the game won t end
People have explained the answer but just FYI the real victory condition is destroying all of your opponents buildings workers don t have anything to do with it
Come watch http www twitch tv sc2proleague
DownWithDin oh wait
lol
is it just me or is the twitch stream not working azubu buffering horribly Edit azubu works fine now
I thought I was the only one Livestreamer works great though
Didn t work for me until I reduced the quality from Source to Medium and reloaded Chat was saying it s something to do with Source quality being subscriber only
thx for this hint for me it works with HIGH qualitiy as well me being a non subscriber
it s not working for me too in chrome but in firefox works just fine
mm twitch didnt work for me either but found azubu
Not working for me also BibleThump
The twitch stream isn t working for me All i m getting is a black screen with the spinning loading circle forever Is it working for anyone else
set stream quality to medium and then reload and switch to high its because source is subscribers only
you re the real MVP thanks
Wow thanks it worked Normally the stream just loads up with whatever quality is allowed
Great games so far and i enjoy the casting but please let us see the ingame time
Yes please I agree as well though really fun games
Sadly not happening with all the illegal gambling in Korea
Can you expound on this about the game clock
There was talk around July that illegal bets based on the in game clock no unit dies in first five minutes etc have become quite popular so KeSPA responded by removing the clock from view This removes the unambiguous timing method from the gamblers and pretty much eliminates such bets
Ahh okay gotcha thanks
Protoss protoss protoss Glad they re still doing well after the adept nerf First time watching pvp when it is disruptor vs disruptor I thought zest was for sure gonna win But damn did he blink at the wrong times that allowed dear to hit MONEY disruptor shots Everytime they go off tasteless and his cocastor just scream It was every entertaining I can see how it can be a pain to play tho lol Edit serious about the glad they re doing well part I was expecting toss to be incredibly weak vs terran based on feedback I ve seen Glad it wasn t necessarily the case
http www azubu tv EN SC2 Proleague If anyone wants to watch english version without waiting for the VOD twitch is subs only for watching the past highlight just click vods on the right side of the screen and pick the most recent one

HYPEEEEEEEEEEE
HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPE
If you compare these games with last DH this is on another planet
Match prepared week s before against a Tournament
And for me and seemingly many others the DH was more exciting seeing the numbers But anyway Good to see some enjoy it
Proleague is always good What s your point
that DH sucked
I had fun
Why must you be so negative Yes Proleague was great I also think Dreamhack was great Why do you have to say that one thing is shitty in order to say that one thing is enjoyable That s just useless negativity
I m at work SO I CANT GET HYPEDI haven t played sc2 in a while uh Game looks slightly different
Don t worry this was just a small rebalance patch See Overlords can scout Supply Depots can be raised and lowered and now Pylons can fuck shit up
But overlords always could scout c buff overlords pls
Let me catch you up to speed The mothership was really op so they gave Terran a planetary core and Zerg a broodmother core Then protoss was balanced which made Dustin Browder mad so now you have this
I still don t quite get it Why is it releasing pylons like a carrier
Someone just replaced the models of the carrier interceptors with MSCore and pylons
Dustin Browder has a problem when protoss isn t the strongest race A mothership core for every race angered our vengeful balance god Thus this incarnation of the mothership core was created The carrier core costs 100 100 and comes with 6 attacking pylons all which grant regular power and supply However pylon overcharge now costs 75 so we ll see how that nerf plays into the meta
I get that this is the joke but like what actually motivated this satire How did they buff protoss
they didnt we got 2 nerfs in the most recent patch
BUT With the reduction in power to MSC and photon overcharge now maybe they can actually look at giving proper buffs to other less used units and allowing protoss players a more diverse unit composition in different match ups at least thats my hope
I feel like all I am using right now is Zealot Archon blink Stalker Disruptor or Zealot Immo Archon Like what the heck man QQ Seriously though I feel like I have very little options
Blizzard thought protoss were too weak because they had to energise an area before building Killing a pylon denied toss building space So any pylons built have infinite energy field range and are stored in projectile firing units Open up the game and build a stalker you ll see it fires pylons too
DK admitted that Terran was slightly underpowered at the end of HOTS and that protoss was slightly OP so to balance this DK now made it so pylons can shoot and also nerfed marauders Game now balanced yay
Haha this is great
David Kim This kind of criticism doesn t help
There is some truth to every positive and negative comment Mothership core is a band aid unit and is ruining the game at least in all PvX matchups anyway
Why though I agree that pylon cannons needed a nerf and chuckled at this post but there s been much hate for the Mothership Core long before LotV Is there a convincing argument for removing the unit Or am I just humorless and missing the joke behind the anti MSC circle jerk
The mothership is literally the one and only thing carrying protoss into the late game It prevents any sort of early game harass efficiently it buys time etc etc etc MEANWHILE protoss armies cannot stand on their own vs bio terran or hordes of zerg units Just imagine how consistent and good protoss army units would be if the mothership core would be scrapped
That s not true I often go two gate two gas for fast tech usually forge with Stargate Robo behind early game poking with adepts if going Stargate and stalkers if going Robo Expand build more production facilities and upgrade into the late game I often skip the MSC until the mid game for mass recall after my push especially against a fast zerg army or even late game for Mothership stealth
Idk Would a terran army be better and more consistent without bunkers and repair Or would it just be unbalance able Defenders advantage is important and having things a macro player can put money into to allow them to hold off aggression and harass make the race less extreme as in either all in or turtling So I don t know if I agree with your statement I mean overcharge was made significantly more dynamic in lotv say what you want about it being OP last patch as in the limited range duration and pylon health makes counter play with harassment exist Looking at things like ravagers popping pylon cyclones and tanks outranging and killing them baiting them out and general increased strength of multiprong aggression due to the lower coverage area see speedling drops and lib harass and what not So the same argument of just cast an overcharge and the base is safe that kind existed in hots isn t quite the same These limitations will be much more obvious after the last patch and the strength of it was nerfed and frankly the original strength of lotv overcharge is probably a large reason people seem to miss the design change implications So is just removing the mothership core a reasonable suggestion No not really Is the mothership core the best solution to the issues toss had in WoL maybe maybe not The current version of the core is a strict improvement design wise from the original so that was blizzards way of addressing the hots bandaid fix Best solution who knows improvement yes for sure
Terran is based around have one main unit that can be upgraded stim shield and supported by other units medivacs marauders widow mines Mech is also doable since terran can turtle very easily that s the lore design of Terran Terran s get bunkers that you fill with army units Zergs get creep speed boost for lings roach and queens so army units Protoss gets mothership core and pylons Army units Nah Why is it that Terran and Zerg must rely on units best defense is a good offense where Protoss must rely on photon overcharge and well positioned pylons that deal massive damage in a large area and buys time for them to tech and make lots of gateways stargates safely and eventually build an actual army This isn t enjoyable Just like how Zergs cant do shit vs mass reaper unless Terran s fuck up or mass adept into mass pheonix harass unless Protoss fucks up the Mothership core allows a certain invulnerability to Protoss for much of the early game With energy and available pylons So essentially for free Again that is not enjoyable to play against I love macro games but not when its forced into it because that is how the game is currently designed edit and to answer you re question if we removed the mothership core photon overcharge redesigning gateway units to be viable and consistent in their application whether through better stats or movement speed or whatever One of the things this reminds me of is the implementation of the Shield Battery in StarCraft I What does the Shield Battery do It replenishes shields lost from units What a great idea why did SC2 get the mothership core when the shield battery could do the same job but even better It s like a pseudo bunker medivac for protoss AND NOT ONLY THAT FOLKS it forces protoss to not mass pylons and stack up energy on their mothership core It forces protoss to make ARMY UNITS and DEFEND with them while microing the shit out of the battery shield to ensure units dont take hull damage Could you imagine In this situation there is a chance that an attacker could break through or that the protoss can defend or there could be a stalemate There is action and suspense and thrill Anything can fucking happen Anything Now come back to real life You have a mothership core and pylons Congrats you just entered the mid game Blizzard removed a ton of great ideas from the original StarCraft when SC2 was released in 2010 Unfortunately But we learned to love the reaper the immortal the old one and banelings Then 5 years later they just plop back in the Lurker Disruptor Reaver and some sort of Valkyrie Wraith hybrid the Liberator I often question Blizzard for their decision making It s extremely odd untimely and usually short of excitement
I thought you were trying to have a discussion not just be generally salty and use lore as a game argument Every race has big defenders advantage aspects not offense is the best defense Bunkers pfs repair queens these are defense only tools for the most part Mothership core is a unit not a building last time I checked But yeah I didn t say there aren t other solutions and a shield batter might be one but trying to make comparisons to brood war when a photon cannon on top of a ramp could do a shit ton more then it can now is kinda silly But yeah don t bother responding if you are going to do so with salty balance whine and brood war talk when you probably didn t even play it
Oh I didn t know we were measuring our e cocks I ve been playing StarCraft since the very beginning stopped around 2006 Same goes for SC2 up to this day albeit not as frequently as I watch it It s not so much of a stretch to mention the Shield Battery when Blizz bringing back iconic units or their spiritual successor such as the lurker and disruptor into LotV Don t put your words into other peoples mouths btw it s childish and arrogant But yeah don t bother responding if you are going to be high on your horse pretending to know more about the state of SC2 when you probably can t even get out of silver league s
How to defend as protoss against almost any early game mid game attack have a pylon RTS is about an interaction between the players with different strategies unit combination timings and positioning It s not exactly fun when the solution to basically every type of early aggression Terran can do is is built a single unit MSC Worse still it is literally just a single click to do it No kiting no micro no real decision Defending with the MSC looks almost identical at any level which is indicative of how little depth it actually has
there is still positioning involved unless you want to stay on just one base also widowmines a lot of zerg and protoss agression into t is defended by have a depot wall Do we start crying and calling depots a bandaid fix for a badly designed race lacking a melee unit no we stop doing builds that dont work and spent the last 5 years without any agression prior to 7 minutes vs terran restrictions like these are what makes your point about timings possible competent players realise that there is a new timing constraint and adapt to it incompetent players keep doing the same stuff and complain about it on reddit hoping that the game will be patched to cater to the one build they haven t strayed from for 4 years while talking about interaction reaction counters and strategy amongst other things
Artosis OH LOOK OUT TASTELESS HE HAS A PYLON LETS SEE HOW WELL HE PLACED IT This is what you pay to see is it
It s not exciting but building placement is fundamental to the game
Getting erect over how well placed a pylon is when it murders an entire strategic attack shows just how piss poor Protoss options are to micro and actually show off their skill
There are many games where good strategies are trumped by simple actions In Magic there s a deck that takes up 8 10 of the meta yet it s absolutely wrecked by a single card
Point for truth 8 10 Execution 3 10
It used to be Artosis OH LOOK OUT TASTELESS HE HAS A FORCEFIELD LETS SEE HOW WELL HE PLACED IT
We literally just watched snute take what should ve been 2 straight games against likely the best protoss in the world by simply making lings baiting 1 overcharge backing off for 14 seconds then going back in and killing the nexus un deterred Meanwhile zerg is able to take 2 bases before their spawning pool without any viable game ending punishment from a protoss Seriously what is the complaint against protoss here
Haven t you been on reddit bro When a Zerg or Terran wins it s all skill When a toss wins it s OP But when said toss loses hes just a baddie obviously
The complaint isn t that the mothership core is OP or uneeded the real problem with the unit is that it is a poorly designed bandaid for a gaping wound Yes the mothership core allows protoss players to play a little bit more greedy and be able to defend aggression with less units but it is at it s core a very boring unit with little interaction It s damage is so low that having an attack is almost meaningless and because of this it relies heavily on photon overcharge which by it s nature is not very fun for either player unless you re playing with aggressive pylons which is hilarious due to the lack of interaction from either side Time warp is a much more interesting ability protoss engages at the time warp and their opponent tries to engage around I m not sure if my point was clear but basically it s kind of boring at what it does even though it does it decently
To add to this the amazingly low cost and how early you get it means it also influences basically any game and especially feels like a band aid solution For example a mothership hero like unit costs like 500minerals 450gas takes a looong time to build and to get it requires tier 3 buildings
And if they d buff Protoss units so that they can actually defend without the need for the overcharge then you d just turn your bitching towards the units And so the cycle of irrational Protoss hate continues
Because buffing Protoss units would instantly kill the game
If it wasn t balanced sure but it s more likely that they will buff the static defenses of Protoss like cannons while in base or the design of sentry OR they will start getting oracles for the sake of stasis warding key positions in order to stall attacks who knows but the possibilities are endless once you remove the band aid fix that ruined an entire fucking race You are ignoring the level of skill required to micro in defense build the right units scout it with enough time to get defense ready and possibly set up a counter attack to hit around the time that the attack actually hits while also building more units to bolster the defense and not instantly lose the game as opposed to clicking a fucking pylon and turn it into a cannon the second the opponent is in vision of your base while blindly and freely roaming the opponent s base with a warp prism that can save pick up from 1 8 the width of your screen that kind of shit is intended for people with little to no brain power
I was talking about Terran And you miss my main point which is I don t think it even means that protoss is overpowered but none of that changes the fact that it s bad design I don t do one base terran aggression auto lose because of MSC and then complain I complain because a single unit literally stops any aggression from working with almost no micro or skill It s a design complaint not balance I don t think it makes protoss unbeatable
a single unit literally stops any aggression from working with almost no micro or skill You are balance whining And it almost sounds like you re talking about a liberator
That s still not a balance whine Balance is win nothing to do with micro skill etc Please link me a game where an early liberator is used to stop a group of units in defense PvT
I didnt say it was bad design I just spent about as much effort fabricating an excuse to call something bad design instead of plis nurf i dont want to adapt
I saw the no very clearly on the next page I m making the point that your argument is completely flawed because you are comparing the most fundamental and essential component of Terran that has not once had a single complaint EVER to justify a spell that majority of the vocal community has agreed is a band aid fix for poor design and is poorly designed itself Take a good look at Photon Overcharge Then look at bunkers and spine crawlers compared to pylons Which cost more Which of them take longer to build Which are not already there out of passive necessity e g supply creep spread before an attack is scouted or begun You really are not making a good case for yourself and that is not really in your control you are simply defending a case that is ultimately unwinnable
depot walls can be defeated though zerg can bling bust or got for fast drop while protoss can lol pylon rush and take down the wall and rush adpets in all this can be defended if scouted and reacted to properly but they still require a reaction from terran name one strategy that either race can throw at protoss that requires a different reaction than clicking on pylons THATS what u jellojellojello4 was trying to argue that protoss doesnt need more than one reaction to ANYTHING in the early game and that makes them boring and gimmicky
I do think msc isn t a good unit but because of its near requirement for protons its importance esp pvz and hero style units That being said pylon cannon doesn t defend against cloaked banshees widow mines liberators with just the right position or cyclones with vision not to mention overwhelming unit counts that can pummel pylons or elevator to where there are few pylons
But we don t bring those issues up because then we couldn t complain about protoss
Does defending with bunkers look any different at different levels does defending your 4th with a PF look any different Frankly its easy to argue that overcharge has more depth then bunkers and PFs do Overcharge baiting simple focusing down the pylons cyclone pylon interaction pylon positioning abusing pylon coverage overbuilding pylons to defend scouted attacks mothership core mobility and multi prong aggression PF just sits there are shoots but I don t see PF is a bandaid A lot of depth was added to overcharge in lotv Say what you want about pylons shooting but it created a lot of counter play and a lot more investment and careful planning and SimCity locations being reactive to scouting information and the such I ve seen a lot of games lost due to pylon placement so yeah a lot of difference between a good and a bad player in that not to mention good players know how to be conservative with the mothership core energy So really say what you want about it but saying it has no depth and acting like its no better then it was in hots is just silly
They re not comparable man Jesus Christ You have to put UNITS inside bunkers for them to be useful With OC you pop it on supply creating buildings that you have to build anyway The only addition is the MSC Why do you insist on conveniently overlooking this
I m not But they are comparable Its a vehicle to get a lot of defenders advantage its just a different way to go about it Every race is different etc etc PF shoots without units inside of it Spines and cannons and spores and turrets etc Bunkers and overcharge serve the same purpose To allow you to defend cost efficiently So you saying that 2 things that serve the same exact purpose shouldn t be comparable just seems odd to me
You say I m making flawed arguments when you cant even keep the difference between power and depth straight Your bunker anolgy is just retarded and ignores any points of how overcharge function Youre discounting PFs because of the timing and literally saying the power of PF isn t important which once again I was talking about design a no click afk defended base when a PF is sooo strong that terrans forgo an orbital for it If you don t see addiontal depth and counter play between hots mamacore and lotv one you are just an idiot There is room to argue against the mothership core I don t deny that But there are just some flat facts that all denying them does is discredits your views of the game
Frankly based on this whole post I would be surprised if you have even played the game Overcharge was reduced greatly in range duration and the overcharged building having significantly less health as well as having to invest money in more pylons then required much like making a bunker and salavaging it later to defend against specific timings and fresh locations If that doesn t add depth via planning investment and significantly more counter play that both players have to work around to you then you just don t understand starcraft There isn t room to argue there Everything else you said is just an extension of that lack of understanding Even the most die hard biased terran player would admit that if they actually understand the game at a reasonable level No point in having any further conversation with someone who doesn t understand the game not going to read a response
The MSC is copping abuse for what it actually does not for the unit that it is A core tech unit that can fly is already very powerful on its own due to the timing that you can get it it hard counters all early game units with the exception of marines with equal or greater value and to balance that you can only make one It is basically a flying cyclone in that regard The actual problem is it s spells I m not even going to go into mass recall because that was a blatant band aid fix to the immobility of the Protoss army but Photon Overcharge and Time Warp are beyond this I ll put it this way If you agree with Blizzard that a single unit that can cast spells which turn a pylon into a cannon thus negating the need to actually build cannons is considered good game design then you are part of the small minority of people that David Kim has succeeded in pleasing but you are part of a small minority because most people hate it This game is a competitive RTS it is built on the principles of the original Starcraft franchise that was proud to be the most mechanically demanding and intricate game regarding strategy even to this day To clarify I have no issue with the evolution of Starcraft you cannot re create Brood Wars and expect people to flock to the same game with 3D graphics it s a pipe dream But if you compare anything in that game to Photon Overcharge you will see why MSC gets so much hate
Well memed
This kind of balancing doesn t help
Still killed the SCVs slower than Adepts
Well he forgot to overcharge the Pylons
Replace pylons with adepts and thats what TvP felt like last patch
but we already have the warp prism adeptlord gif what if we combined them
A core that shoots pylons that are overcharged and summon adepts with every shot who in turn fire mothership cores
RIP my ears
I almost fulfilled the lycan prophecy when I clicked on that link holy poop
Man I wish these pylons were shooting like overcharged pylons It would fit so well

Legacy of the Mothership core
The one and only thing keeping SC2 back from greatness and carrying Protoss players into the late game
Holy shit I fucking love you man
Love Your GirlFriend
made me laugh
do one for tankvacs
Bahahahahaha
not sure where the cast is from but this is totally why Korean cast is better
I would play the shit out of this
The sad part is that this is only 50 more retarded than the current version of the mothership core
ahahahahaha
That is exactly what Terran tears are made from
lol any Korean speakers around to explain what they re actually saying
It s the Dota 2 The International 3 Grand final when Alliance was taking the last win with the million dollar dream coil
To correct you wasn t the million dollar dream coil that was TI1 with Na Vi Otherwise it was TI3 grand final last game before Alliance got the W Edit After watching video found out I was incorrect Apologies
million dollar coils is from TI3 by S4 I am pretty positive Here is a Korean cast of it https www youtube com watch v wkHVLeR72b4
Oh S4 was Puck Oh gotcha it was multiple dream coils I always associated the million dollar dream coil with Dendi with his huge play after Rosh Apologies I ll throw in the edit
here you go
According to the audio source linked about Pummel it Pummel it S4 S4 S4 GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG I missed some lines but yeah its not related to SC2 unfortunately lol
How much for one and I will take one
ESPO ESPO ESPOOOOO
accurate
That s fucking hilarious I love Starcraft humour
pretty balanced if you ask me
Haha i feel like the commentating is the voices of all the pylons
The beautiful sound of koreans speaking Hype
idk about you but I d be terrified out of my mind if someone ran into the CoC yelling at the top of their lungs that Pylons were destroying the base Even if they weren t shooting things imagine accidentally getting smacked by a flying pylon You d be a tiny bloody smear on its shielding before getting flung into the distance
hahaha so good
GEEEE GEEEE
This is actually how it is right now
Mothership core is a significant factor in why I still haven t bought LotV And I play Protoss I just don t want to play a game with such a stupid fucking unit
Ok have fun playing WoL with the 4 other people who still play
Yea you should totally come play LOTV where you will get nothing but shit simply because of the race you play
Toss has got shit for all of the games Its not like it s new
I think he plays starbow
lol I haven t laddered since two weeks after HotS released
They should remove the mothership core to cater to you the guy who doesn t play the game he s complaining about
MSC is a horribly designed band aid hero unit It doesn t belong in the game It s not my problem if you can t acknowledge that I figured the band aid would be ripped off with LotV I was wrong
It s not a perfect solution but nothing is StarCraft 2 isn t ever going to be broodwar

Bias is strong with this one
Well that was unexpectedUp voted for MS paint skills
I like this idea a tonne
I love it but for whatever reason the hole in the bottom ravager is unsettling
yeh maybe if it changed colors or had an animation to match the cooldown speed Not a fan of the black hole either on a sidenote i think as many units as possible should have these actual visual indicators Its a nice thing to have
I wish they would get rid of the indicator that roaches have burrow movement It s supposed to come as a surprise
What s the indicator
Spikes on back
Huh never noticed Thanks
They get extra spikes or crystals on their backs
Yeah it s pretty dumb that it signals to get ready for it It s already a pretty weak strategy overall
i suppose if you were really going for the surprise element your first contact would be sharking in to the mineral lines instead of just burrowing in combat But I do see your point
r trypophobia
I love that 4chan made up trypophobia and now there s a whole bunch of people that think they have it
There s some evidence that it s a biological revulsion instead of a learned cultural fear though The paper basically argues that we evolved to be instinctively fearful of dangerous creatures full of holes such as swarm hosts
The first time i saw zebra mussels underwater i was freaked out by them like they made me feel uncomfortable or imagine a barnacle suddenly opening its mouth and biting your finger They re unsettling
If its any consolation that s not actually a barnacle s mouth A barnacle is basically an upside down shrimp that lives in a house the house is the part you see When the mouth opens up its little feet come out and bring in food
still makes me shutter thanks for the insight
I think it s fair to say that if you think you have a phobia you have it
It s the same thing as the whole Boycott Star Wars thing The problem didn t exist until 4chan decided to make it exist
4chan isn t some magical place where ideas are born People may have always had an irrational fear or feeling of discomfort of those tiny holes Now there s a word
Ive always had that fear I tried to explain it to friends but no one understood until last year when the word became popular
r hypochondria
Not the same thing A phobia is entirely in the mind It doesn t matter if I believe I have a cold if I exhibit literally none of the physical symptoms
4chan didnt make up trypophobia at all although it seems to have been around since 2012 Source https en wikipedia org wiki Trypophobia
To be honest I ve been disturbed by those pores but only on skin ever since I saw some photoshopped picture of nipples with pores supposedly caused by a parasite or something This was like 10 years ago But if it s just holes on random objects it doesn t bother me
This is a great idea and it would be consistent with other cooldown based mechanics like the widow mine and disruptor
I m still not keen on these two I ve become used to the widow mine but Disruptors look the same to me
Well the disruptor changes while the ball is out at least The ravager doesn t change at all Also I think the disruptor core should be changed to show that it s on cooldown It was a frequent suggestion during beta
Yes I can tell when the disruptor has the ball thing out because it is frozen in place But I can t tell which is on cool down if there are many of them
I think this is a good idea Make in an indicator for both opponents I always thought it would be nice to see the bile in an arch flying to its objective instead of this straight up straight down thing This would allow them to remove the cursor from the ground and make it more innate
I agree that the straight up straight down thing doesn t feel right to me anyway but that wouldn t work because Corrosive Bile does damage to air units So it d have to take a very weird trajectory It d also have to move rather slowly and at different speeds depending on how close the target is I d rather they scrapped the ability entirely and came up with something different
Widow mines are kind of like that they change colour on cool down
they do lol i never noticed
Yup they also have a little arming animation when the cooldown expires
This would be a great addition Kind of like how a disruptor telegraph if it s ready to fire again or how bunkers show if they re loaded this would give a good visual indicator of whether or not you should attack into ravagers or not
That would be a great change I think both zerg players and opponents would want this so they can see how many shots are left
I love it
Why are there so many units with no indication that an ability is on off cooldown in starcraft to begin with I cant tell if a bunch of stalkers have blink on cd when i encounter them Sure i can reasonably guess that its off CD but still Same with medivac speedboost
This is very nice suggestion Approved
Really cool idea super for this
Such a great idea Combining utility and design
This would be beneficial for the zerg player for sure When I offrace I often shift spam bile if I have 10 ravagers and I m pretty clueless when I ran out and when they re recharged again And I imagine it wouldn t be too big of a hassle to make it look good as well
But then people are gonna want blink stalkers and disruptors to do the same for fairness
And why not honestly sc needs these kind of visual indication Look at lings with and without speed easy to spot the difference Same for marine with CS
Or roaches with tunneling claws
visual indicators all around are a great idea imo also it would be cool if units did more to show how much health they had kind of like how buildings have fire animations when theyre on low hp
Now that you mention it I wonder what the stalker change would be I think Disruptors would be very beneficial in gameplay Even if I am controlling them I am not sure which ones have cooldown or not
Just make the legs glow when they have blink available
That would look kinda cool actually Would be useful on both sides
disruptors already have different animation depending on readiness of their ability
You can tell when a roach has burrow movement but not when a stalker has blink
I don t play Zerg this is a really good idea regardless
Great idea but the technology just isn t there yet
No thanks because that looks terrifying
This is something that would be recognized as a good idea and added into the game if Valve was developing sc2 Since Blizzard develops this game great suggestions like this will just fade away
Not sure if they can afford to allocate one of their 4 developers to do this OHSHITWAIT I m supposed to be positive Not sure if they can allocate one of their 150 developers to do this
i r8 this 8 8 m8
Sure if it didn t look gross and weird
It makes the unit less skilled Since when you use this abillity you count how many you use atleast on high level Also the opponent counts how many you use and take the ravagers minus the abillity that got used For example 10 ravager 5 used it 10 5 5 left Now instead you can see it
Not actually you will not have time to count them in the middle of a fight If you want to know how many you have the easy way is still count how many you have Side note I knew someone would skill gap argumento
That s some highlevel analysis right there

People should realize that all major sports have issues like this It is a reflection on the player not the game DOTA LOL CSGO have similar scandals Boxing Soccer and Cycling all have seen scandles that were far more serious as in people die There is an over reaction in the community Things like this are impossible to get rid of Match fixing is a symptom of gambling it is not a reflection of the game The suggestion that Lifes action could some how end the popularity of SC2 is just more of the same chicken little the sky is falling that gets constantly posted on this subreddit
Wasn t there a LoL player who committed suicide because he didn t want to match fixed but he was severely pressured to do so
yes he jumped from a 10 story building and somehow survived and after recovering he became a streamer afaik The manager that fucked his team and him over run away and i dont think he was ever caught
And now some people are saying he the player not the manager is being charged accused of rape
http www inven co kr webzine news news 149611 site lol Can t translate but here is the source for that apparently
Tried to commit suicide didn t die though
In a shady challenger minor league team in Korea though There s never been any match fixing scandal from a major league pro team
Fixing a match is worst thing you can do its way worse than cheating If you cheat you give yourself an advantage and a possibility to win unless you cheat blatantly but that will never work as a pro while when you fix the match you have determined the outcome 110 In addition it is almost impossible get caught or to even prove it Matchifixing undermines the whole foundation of the sport If there is even the slightest belief that matches are rigged and its not the best player that wins people lose interest quickly And when this is done by someone in the top of the tier 1 then it hits even harder You cannot blame the gambling community for this What should happen though is that the leagues should have contracts with SERIOUS financial repercussions if a teammember is get caught cheating or matchfixing Then the team would have to have similar contracts with their players This way you would remove most of the incentive for teams to perhaps aid such cheating matchfixing as well as hopefully have them taking proper anticheat fixing measures
I d disagree and say cheating is worse In a twisted way when a player match fixes he helps another person at their own expense Cheaters only look out for themselves Could you imagine if the headline were Life paid other people to lose to him Or Life figured out to maphack in official matches Only thing is it s much harder to cheat in a good system
Match fixing is considered worse than cheating and rightfully so It is much easier to develop proper anti cheats both software and hardware than to detect and prove match fixing Also the money one can make for one throw way more than what you can make for a win with cheats
That would have broken my heart If the amazing talent that was shown was an illusion honestly it would have taken away from my love of SC2 With the matchfixing I m like life you fucking idiot why but you are still a god at SC2 and nothing will ever change that
Firstly the only reason there is match fixing is because of the gambling No one loses on purpose to gain nothing unlike cheating which people do all the time for no financial gain Secondly threating huge financial punishment is a quick way to get rid of leagues Who would want to sponsor a team under the threats of law suits and financial penalties Life time bans are allready in place from kespa If others joined in to prevent match fixers from earning a living off the game it would help Point is you dont punish the organization you punish individuals What should be done Target the ones paying the players and ban people involved from the sport Unfortunately there is not much more that can be done Once again match fixing is not a problem that specific games have Match fixing happens when an event is gambled on The more money that you can potentially win the bigger and shadier people you will attract to start fixing matches Any draconian measures aimed at teams end match fixing will only prevent people from creating teams at all Sad part is that THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MATCH FIXING It is impossible to be inside the hearts of the players All we can do is ban them from the sport The more popular a game is the more severe that punishment becomes
People do cheat for financial gain just look at the KQLY incident in CSGO Regardless you should be able to hold an organisation responsible If not you can come in situations like we have seen in many other sports like Cycling and recently Russian track and field where organisations teams put so much pressure on athletes and encourage them to do illegal stuff in order to produce good placements and improve sponsor income Its easy for sponsors to avoid getting fined just by adding simple clauses that don t make them liable The main goal here is to get organisations and teams to oppose all forms for cheating and match fixing and to know the risk They might enforce drug controls gambling prohibition and hardware anti cheat measures themselves to make sure they are as clean as possible And yes involved players and other teammembers should receive life time bans as well as financial fines
no not really The matchfixing in dota was a SEA no name team that wanted cash cause they dont earn shit in SEA and Solo was so long ago and so hillariously cheap that he became the most used dota meme in existence He basically lives in his own purgatory now The fixing in dota wasnt a big deal cause it wasnt one of the best doing it

MC Huk Destiny and IdrA are my top 4 favourite players of all time MC because he s just legendary and literally godmode and is one of the best if not the best player of all time and has a damn funny personality too HuK is great because he s a lot like MC he s very funny too and he s a Canadian Protoss just like me although I Zerg and Protoss now plus it s always funny watching him try to do Gateway allins and wonder why they don t work and he also has top 3 control IdrA is great because his rage is entertaining and he s funny and I also currently have have had rage issues so I can relate and he s honest Destiny is great because he s entertaining and honest as well
I know he is right It still doesn t make it any less upsetting Especially for someone I guarantee probably got a fair amount of people into Starcraft Just need time
oGs haven t heard this for a long time
oGsMC 4Head
Why would Blizzard decide to bar someone like MC from competing in NA and EU He has way more personality than all the foreignors I d rather listen to his broken english than another sports interview with a foreigner
Most players How many matchfixers are there leftThe players are still being announced but the current ones are Cure Snute TLO Hydra Bly Rogue VortiX Ryung Polt Kelazhur Nerchio sOs
sOs and Polt D Definitely tuning into this
Honestly this is my favorite type of line up Good foreigners and good koreans mixed together I ll be watching for sure if I am able
Nice lineup
Invite Marinelord Uthermal plz D
all the invites are finalized I invited both of those players btw but only one was able to make it this time We just need a replacement for Life soon as I find someone we ll announce the matchups
Does it have to be a zerg If not Mil Showtime would be a cool player to see if he is available
Showtime s awesome and one of the players we considered and wanted we weren t able to reach him as quickly as others probably just because I don t have his skype tbh T T but it ahs to be Korean it s 8 koreans 8 foreigners
This is one crazy freaking lineup By the way do we know who the casters are yet
So insane you have Rogue sOs Cure and Polt
Awesome great to see Polt and Cure Love me some good Terran action
sickkk cure and o
Did you say sOs Oh boy
dollar sign oh dollar sign oh take me away 3 3
day and time with sOs in it I can t miss it
I love the lineup but I feel that Snute and TLO are a bit outclassed here
This is unfair People want to see their local NA stars duke it out not Koreans Then NA can be as good as Koreans in the future This is a well established fact
Yeah we do but we all love watching Korean vs Foreigner attempts too We ll probably get crushed but when it s not every single tournament going on then I m okay with it
JAGW players Yes please 8 foreigners and 8 koreans really looking foward to this
Vortix gonna show everybody who s boss now
Holy s awesome lineup o and Polt if TY plays it will be the most hype tournament
Sick line up can t wait to watch
This looks fantastic Now if my favourite player would just play in it that would be ByuNd fantastic
I m looking forward to this event The lineup is really sick
look at all the JinAir players what relation might Catz have with them hmmmm Anyway I m definitely cheering for the JinAir boys and Snute and VortiX and Hydra So damn excited
it s really easy to ask players to ask their teams or certain players of their teams for instance I asked Ryung to ask if GuMiHo or DeParture from his team would be interested but they weren t this time hydra asked ByuL to ask popular CJ players I asked him to msg Life and ask afreeca freecs ask JinAir etc Earlier this week I asked Solar to ask Samsung if they would be willing to play a showmatch vs WCS as a team I also asked soO and hydra also asked Innovation we ve asked Flash and KT players in the past The great majority of answers is usually sorry we can t or I want to but it s up to my team or conflicting events etc etc The relation is as simple as we ask our friends to ask their friends on our behalf this time around JinAir and other KeSPA teams were more open to playing than usual because proleague season is just starting
Dude you are awesome Keep up the good work
Great lineup Looking forward to pretty much every match
I m pretty excited for this Any chance of a rebroadcast at a more NA friendly time
Not 100 certain but since it will be on CatZ s twitch channel you should be able to watch the vod whenever you want to
Awesome nice to see some good news
Yeah that is a crazy lineup Gonna be glued to the PC for this one
Pretty sick lineup indeed Go Snute D
Really nice looking forward to it
Wow this is awesome Cheering for TLO and Snute
why is it not on tl
No idea I was going to link the post to the TL page but couldn t find one
http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Kings of the Craft
Thank you very much
would still be nice to have a TL thread in the Tourneys section I tweeted Catz about it I don t feel comfortable making it myself o
Looking forward to it
I love me some sick online invitationals I just hope Rob from production is there He is the best part
Amazing initiative is CatZ gonna be casting with that other dude from recently again sorry other dude I cant remember your name
The last tournament had x5 Kawaiian cocasting https twitter com x5 Kawaiian
Looking great awesome Root keeps organising these kind of tournaments
WANNA KNOW THE BEST PART OF THE WCS CHANGES Now there s a really big difference between Premier and grass roots online tournies Before it was basically the same thing except for prize pools Now this is a great chance to see Foreigners vs Korea THAT S something worth getting excited about this year
My family will be watching the superbowl but I ll be tuned into this bad boy WOOOOO Starcraft I love you
Bold move hosting it on Super Bowl Sunday
I don t know quite a large amount of the audience is probably non american
I was joking because I didn t think there d be a huge overlap in the fan bases Maybe I should have added kappa
I was too Kappa
Is there a TeamLiquid thread about it Reddit Twitter is really terrible for following a tournament and keeping on updated information I want to be hyped but I don t know anything about it
Vamos Juan VortiX la armada espa ola Excited to see this after Catz rant More ROOT things please
Can t wait Hopefully if it s at a crazy time for NA we can get a vod to watch of it later but this is exactly what the scene needs right now Thank you to all of Team ROOT for setting this up
Calling it now Polt or Rogue are gonna win No matter how hard we ban them from our tournaments Koreans are still better
Which is precisely why they re banned
It s region locked not race locked Hydra Violet and Polt are all living in America hence they can compete in WCSCan t help but notice this is now useless facts about feardragon instead of with feardragon
Maybe feardragon is a reaper
Fear the reaper
That s not the Illuminati song that s the X Files theme
God dammit I woke up 2 minutes ago and felt like I needed to post one quickly Maybe rushed a little too much
I like it can we keep it this way
Unless you change the posting rules of Reddit it will be staying this way
I think they meant that they d like future useless facts Feardragon posts to keep the new and accidental Useless Facts About Feardragon title
Ah I see I thought they wanted OP someone to change the post title
You are now a reaper congrats
Useless facts about fear dragon 1 He sometimes posts in haste and makes typos
For a second I thought I was on r StarcraftCirclejerk
Terran so underpowered their units can t even get kills
Not shown The kill is actually credited to a Cyclone on the other side of the map
Or that Carbot Tempest from outside the galaxy
Wasn t there a glitch before that teleporting bcs count as resources lost Terran so up they lose units before losing them
I know the past two days haven t been the most uplifting in terms of news but don t forget the game will continue to be there for us and we still have a lot of cool stuff happening in the scene If you want to see more useless facts easiest way to find them is here
People are only creating drama so you will post more useless facts
This fact isn t about feardragon I m disappointed
Does the nexus still have a kill count while the Pylon does not
This is more like a bug fact tho xD
I agree
I don t think so I can t think of any reason to consider this a bug
Because it s clearly not working correctly
He s trolling Check his other response
They re joking about the original double post 1 and 2
Oh I m an asshat ty
This joke is really not getting the praise it deserves
Well it s still useless even if it works right
Maybe if it was a zerg reaper
This is a useful fact for casters Are they actually the 1
Very useful for players too Unit kill count determines which Reaper is going to get sent on a suicide scouting mission
Useless fact about fear dragon he does not own feardragon1 to feardragon63
literally unplayable
Well If Grenade was still alive it will have one kill Duh
Reapers don t kill SCV s grenades do
Very useless as always
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE
Super easy to fix for Blizz Great find D
We should make a tournament with a mod where those facts are completely emphasized
Glorious Absolutely fantastic
Hmm this is interesting for spectators right Or is that just me
Already knew this one they should make it count though
This is more like a bug fact tho xD
I disagree
Eh I would consider this a bug The kill counter should display every kill the unit makes regardless of if it was a spell or ability
The unit is the grenade apparently It s like vultures and spider mines
You believe grenades should have free will and be responsible for their actions hmm
According to the engine the grenade is a unit as much as the reaper is
Repost this if you are a beautiful strong grenade who don t need no reaper
This seems like a bug
Have you ever done one about how Banelings have a kill counter Seems kinda useless to me
I miss when they used those grenades on buildings p
Under what scenario would this ever be useful misleading advertising
If you wonder how much damage you did worker harassing you might look at your reapers kills If some kills were from the grenade this might cause you to underestimate the amount of damage you did making you believe your opponent is in a better position than he really is
And vice versa If I am jumping around the map while defending a harass I will click on the enemy until to see how many kills it has to judge how much damage it did
Exactly this Polt once was not sure if he killed a worker at the 3 minute mark and he was trying to figure it out for a solid 15 seconds It probably wouldn t have affected anything but hey if even a pro is bugged by it
This was actually a good response That makes a lot of sense although I never really glance down at my reaper kills especially if I have built more than one I guess that is what makes it 1 useful though right
Read the title again
The antonym of useless if useful 99 useless implies 1 useful PlainSight provided an actual answer that put together a scenario where this information would be useful
It says useless not useful The opposite
You have managed to make this all about you again didn t you
have you been watching polt s streamthis is the worst SC news I ve ever read
I loved him so much As much as a grown man can love a 17 year old Asian boy But now he has gone and broke my heart Edit Okay he s only been accused Innocent until proven guilty But still it s so damn sad to read
It s believed they have enough evidence to prosecute him for it that s why this next step has been taken As sad as it makes me the chances he is innocent are getting smaller
Yeah they don t tend to go after athletes or sport icons if there aren t some pretty solid evidence
Well thats good news for him then
There are several ways to love a 17 year old Asian boy
All of them shamefully

There s a 98 conviction rate Unless he miraculously falls into the 2 he s guilty
So you re saying there s a chance
Life finds a way
Yeh it s pretty sad T T
Look at it from the bright side now the Korean scene has more room for new talent Everything will be fine s
Downsizing is healthy boys
D O W N S I Z E B O Y S
So Life in prison
most likely a life ban from the scene and probably anything else in korea he is basically fucked in korea shit like this follows you forever
Not necessarily we need to wait and see the facts how he s prosecuted and if he s convicted Dragon had a match fixing scandal and was eventually found to be innocent now he streams with a decent following I think Life could still be an SC2 pro if he s found to be innocent but that s a big and optimistic if
I thought it was for maphacking
The initial controversy with Dragon was over stream cheating not maphacking He openly admitted and apologized for listening to a live stream of the match against TheStC Later in an unrelated thing he was accused of match fixing vehemently denied it and was eventually cleared of all charges but not before he took some pretty bad flak for it
They have a 98 conviction rate He s utterly screwed
That s Japan
see page 258 it s high but it s roughly 70 just eyeballing the ratio it s nowhere NEAR 90 https books google com books id pLbnCAAAQBAJ pg PA259 lpg PA259 dq korean conviction rate source bl ots CezHUcA4Id sig 9OCGtB75ToWDbStw0t15rGnBt68 hl en sa X ved 0ahUKEwiu pe6qdXKAhVGeSYKHbsxDKoQ6AEIJzAB v onepage q korean 20conviction 20rate f false
Essentially his normal life in Korea is over Best move if he gets convicted or whatever you call it for him will probably to live elsewhere
The long game to avoid military service It s all clear to me now
I come from the small tribe of r osugame and its both interesting and depressing to see that other games are this affected by conscription
Savior didn t leave his house for years after the incident
How familiar are you with korean culture Their entire society condemns you the second you get convicted for this His future employers are gonna see thos etc
people should see the things that happen in kpop peoples lives get ruined over silly shit that they didn t even do
For those out of the know he s how ridiculous KPop gets Female pop stars frequently have clauses in their contracts stating that they can t date anyone Ever The idea is that fans who desire to be with singers will feel like the celebrity is attainable very deliberate use of the word attainable here so long as they re single Female performers have lost rights to their creative work and have lost contracts over paparazzi catching them on dinner dates And these women rarely if ever receive another contract from any entertainment company Those women are blacklisted throughout the industry for going on a dinner date South Korea takes celebrity culture way too seriously

Great write up you found Thanks for sharing
Sure thing I had just happened to read this a few days ago I was amazed that someone would feel the need to shave their head in contrition for spending the night at their boyfriend s house
Hell a guy s live was ruined for saying that he went to Stanford and the crazy thing is that he did actually do so
You re referring to tablo of epik high He suffered a stupid amount of stress and hardship after the whole fiasco but he is pretty much over it now His albums are stellar and the group is doing better than ever
Also it was proven he actually went
Still he was guilty even after proven innocent
Sounds like a Reddit conviction
Jesus just read the Wiki article about the incident The guy flew to Stanford shot a documentary showing university officials printing the correct documents on camera then was subject to a police investigation that independently confirmed the information And still people didn t believe it Truly insane
Its like how conservatives kept asking for obamas long form birth certificate then they wanted a certificate of life birth Then after that some still dont believe it
Rip Tablo
People didnt want to believe he was so academically successful and intelligent Then look at the IU pedophile bullshit
Yeah its insane how fucked up people can become just because of rumours Lifes status is basically destroyed even if he was innocent
You overestimate it He ll never have a possibility to work in e sport again but Starcraft isn t important enough to really prevent him from getting a job ever again The other problem is he ll have to go to school again
Starcraft maybe is not important enough but think about this He is getting charged for being a part of a match fixing scheme Starcraft does not matter at all in this case If he is proven guilty in a court then it doesn t matter that he did matchfixing in a game like starcraft what matters is that he actually was involved in the matchfixing in the first place I have a friend who did stupid shit when he was younger and now his criminal record is always following him when he applies for work He is a blue collar worker and even that job he got thanks to his mother who is also working in that firm I can add that this is Sweden Now think about South Korea where crimes are actually taken with more seriousness than in Sweden If he is lucky he can manage to find a job and live a normal life
I understand the point My sister s boyfriend was part of a jewelry shop robbery he parked the car a few streets away his cousin told him he just had a small course to make that he was right back The guy didn t know about any robbery and spent one year in prison Although he was freed because it was clear his cousin was the bad guy he has served a sentence although small He followed a program with the prison with the goal to get back to work had a small job in a big State company and after a few years went job hunting again So I had thought that you could live with a judiciary past but I guess this isn t the case everywhere
The people who can really speak as to whether this stuff marks you for life or not are the people who ve been through this What does Savior do today Did he recover from his situation If he says yes well then But if he talks about all these opportunities that he knows full well he s excluded from even after all these years well that s the kind of stuff that you won t walk away from
I see what you did there
I wonder how much money it took to buy Life off I mean the guy made 460 000 in four years of work his match fixing price must be something like 10K if BboongBboong and YoDa were getting 4 6K for their thrown matches
yep 460000 prize money plus the salary if confirmed there must be a lot of money involved let s hope least people possible
A professor one time told me he was approached by a parent after class to buy a grade The dad whipped out his check book and the prof said two million the dad said what and the prof said if this gets out it not only ruins my job here it ruins my career as an educator and it ruins my career as an academic If this gets out it invalidates my entire adult life s effort You want me to gamble that then you better be able to comfortably take care of me into retirement That s what s at stake This kid didn t lose money made leading up the kid lost all the money that would have been available after this including any tangential work related to this Hope the kid took enough to not worry
Assuming he doesnt have repay the money
Your professor is a boss
Well I think it depends on potential payoff for the ones who were going to bet that he would lose So if it s 10 to 1 maybe they pay him more
Life found a way alright
Man life was the iconic player of the HOTS era This is just sad to see
Even late WoL going head to head agains Mvp and winning
Now I m super sour about Life Denying Mvp his G5L fair and square only to throw it all away by matchfixing years later
Looks like Life was the true sAviOr of sc2 indeed
Why did it have to be a zerg player
he was corrupted by the Overmind
It s always the Zerg players sAviOr Ogogo Luxury
Spreads like tumors
Not like this
Not life this

Best FPL anti pick ever
Usually I really enjoy sc2 drama but not this time Please dont be true
To be honest the authorities really need to bust this case wide open and see just how deep the rabbit hole goes I m pretty sure matchfixing in Korea is a wide sweeping issue and that KeSPA are very reluctant to investigate it further especially if we ve seen a number of suspicious series from top tier pros and have some very big names in the scene indicted on charges
He s only 19 and has essentially fucked up his future in Korea or anywhere else for that matter forever
Assuming he s found guilty that is
Even if he s found innocent people will talk about it and he may find himself in KeSpa jail
Even if you proved yourself as innocence you are always going to get discriminated This is particularly the case in Asia
Is there a cultural reasoning behind this I do not understand If you re innocent you re innocent By this logic you could fuck up anyone s life by accusing them of rape
But you can
This is a thing all over and yes almost anywhere you can really fuck someone up by accusing them of rape whether they did it or not The issue here is that the media is going to run the name of the accused party through the dirt during the investigation Its not deliberate most of the time but most people read accused as Guilty Once the court of public opinion has sided against you even if later found innocent your reputation has been destroyed and most people will still perceive you as guilty
plus 19 is an age of majority in Korea that timing
I don t know how that works in Korea but it s a principle of law that you are tried under the law at the time of the crime occuring ie if you were less than 18 when a crime happened you ll be charged as a minor even if you re 20 when caught If the law changed and became harsher you ll be tried under a softer law too
that would make sense
So if Life does get banned does CJ Bunny automatically get into Code S
Bunny is the only person on the planet praying that life is found guilty xD
I guess even Bunny would hope for Life to not be guilty this would be a huge blow for Korean pros especially
Haha he ll get wrecked by TY again
I guess we have some idea of the names Wolf was hearing during the Prime case now
I m absolutely shattered Life has a legitimate claim as the best SC2 player ever His multiple championships his unending skill at playing series and his opponents We just lost our Lebron James to illegal gambling
Kinda funny because Michael Jordan was involved in a lot of gambling during his career too and would often lose big on bets There s a theory out there that his break to play baseball at the peak of his career was actually a secret deal with the commissioner of the nba so they wouldn t have to publicly suspend or ban him for gambling the way he did
Build a wall to keep the cheating Koreans out of WCS and make SC2 great again
R I P Life and Korean SC2
The scene doesn t rely on one individual The scene will move on and that s all there is to it
The scene will move on but this may affect not only viewership but sponsorship as well which would be a big deal The extent of the damage is tough to guess though
I know if i was an investor this would be a red light for me if he s found guilty it s downright despicable he had the potential to be the best some might say he was no excuse for this shit
Ehh seeing your favorite player get banned for life is going to have a major impact on a lot of viewers including me
he was the only player that got me interested in the game since WOL the only reason I would watch the streams when I had to be sleeping This is really sad If he stops playing I don t think I ll watch sc2 that much
Say that to NA CSGO
NA CSGO was dead in the water anyway
Noob here what is match fixing
Losing on purpose Basically if Team A is really favored to win Team B underdog will have a large payout for gambling on them Maxfixing occurs when players from Team A bet on Team B then purposefully lose in order to win a large payout
I should point out that s not necessarily the case in SC2 You don t have to lose to match fix there s bets that say the match will be over within X amount of minutes game time for example you can easily do a one base all in or a speedling rush and end the game quick
This seems hard to believe Why would someone like Life accept money to fix a match when he s already so successful Why would he need it THIS SUCKS
Young and stupid He s only 19 years old 19 year old me with 400k made would be doing a lot of stupid things
and the fixed matches were done when he was 18 yo
wtf i thought he was like youngest sc2 player in the scene like 14 15 yo Maybe he was last I checked Time flies
2011 he was 14 15 now its 2016 14 5 19
Maybe he was the one to pay DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
Threatened
All the banned players chould have show matches sAviOr FTW
idk why but I feel like for some reason Life s dad is involved Never liked that dude His son beat MVP to become GSL champion at 15 and he couldn t even smile
Whatever hes still the best zerg This new genuinely makes me sad but match fixer or not I d watch any game he played in One thing that worries me about esports scenes in countries with big organised crime is that if big money was riding on these results the chances are big criminals may be involved in fixing them Like do we expect 17 year old korean kids to stare down some hardcore gangsters when professional boxers can t
He should move to America and continue to play We let famous people get away with stuff all of the time
Seriously He s a suspect he has by no means found guilty yet He allegedly received money for matchfixing until he s found guilty you should all keep your cool and just wait it out Innocent until proven guilty I find it disappointing to see how quickly you guys are jumping the media bandwagon and how fast you do a full 180 on your opinion on someone who is just a suspect tt This is how someone s career and name gets ruined after having been a suspect but proven innocent Plenty of stories around Charges get dropped but the person s name is ruined forever Also Life made almost 500k during his career so financially likely would not have been a motivator IF he already matchfixed he or his close relatives possibly got threatened by dangerous people who don t like being fucked with
I cant imagine they would arrest him with no evidence He might not be guilty but you cant say its looking good

if he s a suspect and was arrested it means they have evidence to support the case as much as i don t want it to be true it seems the odds are against him and even if he was pressured to matchfix from some outside source he d still be permabanned by kespa
I get and respect your point but it s not looking like people apart from the usual retards are throwing shit at anybody there is just sadness in Life s and SC fans because this could be a catastrophe for the entire scene and because it s hard to imagine that a teenager would get this kind of charge without some kind of legit evidence plus believe me if Life is found innocent his reputation won t be ruined at all people are gonna be SO RELIEVED he would be loved even more than he was before
No Reputations take way longer to fix
Not for a small community like Starcraft
You underestimate humans
He was charged according to this tweet You don t arrest someone and charge them if you don t have evidence
He s been arrested There is a 90 something percent conviction rate for this kind of thing and due to how the system works they don t arrest someone unless there s enough to likely convict them They don t arrest suspects Nobody arrests suspects You arrest someone you re going to bring to trial There s a reason why the arrest is the last part of a police drama because that s the guy going to trial Yes he s not been convicted but it s safe to say he will be
They might for a lot of crimes but match fixing or fraud almost never see arrest before a significant case is built up
I completely agree and I hope in hell he is found innocent
Keep in mind the police wouldn t just arrest someone for no reason They have enough evidence against him to arrest and charge him Otherwise they wouldn t risk arresting him and potentially having to let him go I find it highly doubtful the police would arrest someone on a serious charge just because Usually the police investigates first then arrest as necessary
According to Korean news sites there was 9 people in total arrested Probably managers and directors that pushed Life to do it Apparently some gang activity had to do with it as some Korean sites are reporting The big thing here is I doubt it was isolated to just Life He was at the top of the starcraft professional scene I m sure others were involved I remember an Innovation vs EDIT SOULKEY finals where Inno went up 3 0 then Soulkey took 4 games with roach all ins while Inno played uncharacteristically poor and never made one tank to hold it This is crazy all this time wasted watching tourneys that likely were majorily fixed
I realize these things makes you question life itself But dont fall in a conspiracy syndrome
There have been some Innovation games in the past with suspicious betting patterns but I hope it s not a case where both were involved I assume multiple top level players fixing with their organisations supporting it would be pretty close to a lethal blow for the Korean scene
jesus guys inno plays a very mechanical style and he doesn t respond well to stuff throwing him off he s an insanely good player mechanically and so people do weird stuff to mindgame him and mess with his head that s the way you beat innovation these speculations are ridiculous a machine like player in a macro game getting thrown off with weird strats under insane pressure MATCH FIXING OMG
exactly its also ridiculous because there is literally zero proof about a fix it was a fucking GSL FINALS and OP didnt even remember that it was soulkey and not life which shows the little research he has actually done on this and instead just spits around blind accusations
Well yeah I see no reason to look at that final since it wasn t even Life playing in it Just saying there was at least one match involving Inno losing in a somewhat weird manner that got pulled from Pinnacle because of the betting patterns Game itself was nowhere near as suspicious the MarineKing game that he s apparently been cleared of throwing intentionally though
That was Inno vs Soulkey
This hurts the game s legitimacy If one of the best players in the world is matchfixing that really hurts SC2 chances of becoming popular
The glory days of SC2 are over dude
2011 peak SC2 RIP
If Life match fixed pretty much says everything about the state of SC2 in Korea
How so
if even someone perceived as doing very well winning a lot of things feels like he isnt making enough money to justify it then theres something really wrong i mean its possible life is secretly a sociopath and just doing whatever because why the fuck not but assuming hes a normal person he has to have decent motivation to do something bad
Being well paid or paid at all isn t a panacea for match fixing in SC2 or any other sport traditional or otherwise Plenty of high profile match fixing tampering scandals in sports have involved people that were well compensated by most reasonable standards Sure more money may remove the motivation for some people but there s always others Sometimes it s that they feel like they should be making more sometimes they have a gambling habit sometimes they just spent all the money People look at Life and ask why he made so much money No one knows the reality of his financial situation Maybe he spent it all Maybe his parents took it all from him Maybe he got scammed out of it Point is the motivation for match fixing is not as simple as he isn t getting paid enough
If the allegations are true it has nothing to do with him not making enough money to justify it Life made more money than every single Foreigner in sc2 He earned 473 000 in prizemoney plus salary We don t know what he has done with that money but if he needed to matchfix out of financial pressures it s because of his own mismanagement not cause of the Korean scene
except we now know looking back that many of the early top winners gave their winnings to their teams to keep them afloat giving a rosier impression of the korean scene than was real and even then noone thought it was great sure its possible he somehow lost his winnings but its not the only reason why he might do this
match fixing happens in literally every sport the difference is people in esport are way too young and stupid and get caught
Greed is common habit of humans You dont have to be a socipoath or need to be rich or poor or just want a little more
Life made almost 500k dollars by the age of 19 You dont see MC being arrested Fuck it
It says more about the player it has little to do with money and more to do with character
his team managers are likely involved Just like Gerrard in Prime Its very unlikely to be a 1 man thing
Nope since it happens in every sport It s like the recent scandal in tennis and tennis is still a popular sport as far as I know What you say is totally unfounded and the fact that you are getting upvoted is kind of depressing The only thing it shows is the state of esport and match fixing in Korea And I don t think any game is spared
one thing s for certain KeSPA is not having huge success in preventing this kind of stuff to happen when sAviOr case happened they were very vocal that despite the damage done a zero tolerance policy was all they needed to prevent corruption from happening guess they were very wrong they should have worked in depth to eradicate bad habits and menaces at the source If it comes out a top SC pro can be easily blackmailed addicted to gambling and stuff it would mean the eSports organizations did not do enough to protect professional scene from these threats I wuould expect atleast some KeSPA representative to admit some kind of responsability for that
Does anyone have any matches that seem fishy or that could be potential evidence anecdotally I mean I can t think of too many matches off the top of my head where Life was beaten or lost in weird ways Maybe he s just that good In a bad way
The one some are pointing to was Life v Solar on Merry Go Round from 2014 Proleague don t know if it is though
The only thing that I can think of that would be remotely suspicious is Life vs Taeja at IEM where he accidentally detonated all his banelings twice It was the 100 000 take all and maybe he thought he wouldn t win the whole thing EDIT Maybe I m thinking of the wrong tournament but point is Life detonating all his banelings multiple times in the series is suspicious
Was hoping Life would be the only player to win the Triple Crown GSL 1 in WoL 1 in HotS 1 in LotV Soo sad now effectively nobody can get this achievement
With the arrest of Life zerg is no longer OP
If it s true then I don t get it He earned so much money from last 3 years that almost no SC2 pro did and only small percentage of adults can earn that much what reason can make you fix a match after having earned that much
Even Savior was at the top of the world when be was match fixing
Criminal gang pressuring your family or your life unless you throw a match
Mafia is everywhere Can I interest you in an anti mafia insurance
They say a man never really knows himself until his freedom s been taken away I wonder how well does he knows himself
I remember when this happened in BW and thinking At least it won t happen again Really difficult to watch a competition when you have good reason to think it s no longer an actual competition May as well watch pro wrestling or something
He had all the tools He had many fans behind his back He has won it all and still doing this If he is guilty man fucking greedy piece of shit
If he is guilty it may not have been because of greed maybe it was take this cash to match fix or your family member is going to have an accident With the people that organise this kind of stuff who knows
So what s the law in Korea Jail or fines They will probably not punish him too harshly but dat criminal record though Hard to get jobs now
What confuses me by far the most is that life already made so much cash in winnings Why would he get into match fixing Maybe this entire thing is much bigger than we realize and there is a lot of people behind it that force players into match fixing idk by threatening or w e Ofc that doesnt make it right and im not trying to defend anyone here but I can just see no logical explanation for why a teenager that already makes hundreds of thousands of in earnings would risk his entire life just to make a couple bucks more Even if that was some serious cash I just dont see it being as simple as that edit now that I come to think about it with all the retirements lately in the KR scene maybe this is all related Maybe there is some Players retiring because they feel its the only way out of this who knows
Fuck this
Yay we re a real sport now
I feel ill
eSports isn t a real sport until it has the corruption of field sports
Maybe he got scammed out of financial motivation in life s case
Wow I don t really follow sc2 any more but I still remember how exciting Life was to watch play and how fucking amazing he was truly one of the best zergs of all time in sc2 arguably the best This would be crushing if it s true
I hardly follow Sc2 anymore and this is crushing news
If Life ended up match fixing It must ve been far higher than what he would normally make I guess there s no money in SC2 like there was in BW So much match fixing potentially even from the tournament winners
I m a bot bleep bloop Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit r games Ten time premier Starcraft 2 tournament champion Life arrested for match fixing x post r starcraft r pcgaming Ten time premier Starcraft 2 tournament champion Life arrested for match fixing x post r starcraft If you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and don t vote in the other threads Info Contact
So what forced him into accepting this Was the money just that good Or is eSports really that bad that one of the most prominent korean SC2 players felt the need to take money for a fixed match
Unfortunately the crowd mentality in Korea is very much guilty until proven innocent maybe Many Korean celebrities accused of misdeeds have had their reputations ruined forever even after they were found totally innocent One example off the top of my head was the controversy over Tablo graduating from Stanfordcoda cloud kingdom day break neo Planet s yeonsu ohana terraform loved them all so much
Rip in peace Cloud Kingdom your sharks will fly forever
Ohana means family
Ohana is what made me hate Protoss
Do you even Yeonsu
Some people play Yeonsu some watch Avilo some get DT rushed on their first game For me it was Ohana
I love that you mention neo planet S It wasnt in the map pool for long and didnt have a huge impact like king sejong or ohana but it was definitely one of my favorite maps This was back in the SH era and it was one of the few maps that was both difficult to split in half and didnt have 1 central pathway to all 4 5 bases on the map That made for some fun games and made SH a lot less obnoxious
It is one of my favorite maps of all time Now that I think of it maybe part of it was the snow All the terrain is similar now
What all those maps have in common that the current maps in the pool don t have is they re all created by users while the current map pool is entirely done by Blizzard
Then maybe in the near future community maps will make it into the map pool again and the past map glory can be relived in this new era I mean community maps weren t you used for the game immediately before anyways right Took time for that to happen Or maybe community maps can be used for the standard entries in the pool and Blizzard can make the fun and new maps
Unfortunately there is no TeamLiquid Map Contest in sight There is a Blizzard call for player made maps but it explicitly asks for creative maps it also gave 2 weeks to make those maps which is way too short Even if a map makes it through it will take untill at least Season 3 before any get implemented But as it looks now no regular player made map entering ladder is anywhere in sight Unless there is a sudden change in mindset of tournament organisers and Blizzard it will probaly stay that way for quite a while
don t forget Frost
Yeah Frost is one of those maps that were instantly loved
I can never read Neo Planet S normally in my head it s being read by the smash bros announcer NEO PLANET S
I really miss King Sejong
I loved some of those maps but Yeonsu was pretty terrible in TvP after a while though WAY too much access to the main back in late 2013 early 2014 when blink Stalkers ruled the matchup
what about bel shir vestige i loved that map
Man I never liked daybreak The rest of them where great indeed
Overgrowth was pretty unique tho offensive gold spinerush lingflood all in was my favorite zvp build there
That s a good point maybe it s because it seems like Blizzard is equating unique with gimmicky when it comes to new maps that I m remembering it as standard
I loved so much that map It was one of the most balanced we ve ever seen No blink abuse possible not too wide open to drops nat not to wide open ez wall
I really like that you could siege the natural really well made map
I was terrified to take a third as protoss Lings would delay the expo two or three times Early mines were pretty good too
It was unique in a good way Not the current bs we have
it still had that X Factor I want more maps like Overgrowth but I don t think Overgrowth was necessarily every other map Not to say that standard maps aren t good or fun and if that s what most people want then it is definitely something that should be brought up and discussion should be encouraged as it is here Personally I like unique maps because they produce unique games as a player I enjoy this because my favorite thing about the game is the strategy bit Blizzard might think along the same lines but ultimately we should always try to find a middle ground that pleases most of our audience and players without alienating the rest if we can help it there are 7 maps available at a time so good middle grounds in something like a map pool shouldn t be too difficult to reach
My problem with a lot of unique maps is the uniqueness is generally only consistency exploitable by only one side of a matchup That builds in a handicap of sorts for one side of a game and that makes games on those maps less interesting to be The original ramp on Daedalus Point was unique but watching protoss play with a massive inherent disadvantage vs zerg was not fun or interesting gameplay
Cloud Kingdom
Do you know about the secret cannon spot
Christ that keyboard
love how hyped Destiny gets hahahah
Antigua shipyard I loved that map so much to me it was some kind of abandoned trading post in firefly Current maps have no character like that
Me too not just because it actually looks like something out of Firefly People complained about how hard it was to get a 4th but I was just a noob Plat Protoss and I could get that 3rd so easy then just A move my Blink Stalker Colossus deathball across the map Good times
Habitation Station King Sejong Station Frost damn I m even Jonesing for Expedition Lost that s how bad things have gotten
Same here but for Coda and Frost
Same here but for Akilon Wastes and Cloud Kingdom
Same here but King Sejong Station
KSS one of if not the best 2 player map in SC2 history Honourable mention for habitation station
If we had to go full League and only play one map forever it would be King Sejong Station
I miss all the good games on Frost Symbol vs InnoVation or Heart vs XiGua was one of my favorites
check out Maru VS Dear on Frost oh baby Oh and nobody cares but my most missed maps are 1 KSS 2 Overgrowth 3 YEONSU BABY
Oh I forgot about that Dear s my favorite players and any series that involve him and Maru back in 2013 is so good I just wish we get some good standard macro maps again
Belshire anyone just me ok
omg I miss that map so much
Catalena coda take me back
Whats the problem With unique maps you can use other builds than on standart maps Whats the point of 7 same maps So you only have to study 1 build With different maps you can have a different build for every map
That s true but then we have maps like Prion Terraces and it s hard to see if units are imbalanced or the map is And then if you want to balance something around one two maps it might break the balance on different maps If you understand what I mean
Yes i understand that but if thats the main point then there should be only 1 map around which the game is balanced and every other map that differs would be at least a little bit unbalanced Maybe there shouldnt be any map on which one race is favored but there should be more different unique balanced maps in which other builds are used to Else there is no point in having more than 1 where every game looks the same Imagine there would be a map with no ground connection and only air for example That would be pretty sick and new Ofc it should be balanced for all races
Which is really really hard to do
I think OP s use of Overgrowth illustrates the point most people are trying to make perfectly Overgrowth allowed players to engage in a massive breadth of play with the forward gold offering all kinds of unique play styles while still giving players that preferred standard maps what they liked A truly great map is one where a game can play out standard or straight up bizarre based on how the players choose to play not how the map shoe horns them into playing The problem with prion terraces Ulrena and Central Protocal isn t that they are unique its that they are just straight up bad Instead of trying to patch fixes etc we need to move on and find our next Overgrowth
Variation is ok but only with in a certain degree The maps we have now are too varied
Unique maps force you to use certain builds on them Standard maps don t limit you as much On standard maps some people are lazy and don t vary their builds but the maps do not tie you to doing only one build they merely make it possible to play that way Nonstandard maps like Prion force you to play very specific builds in specific matchups and are ultimately more limiting
I miss many standard maps but overgrowth had to die It had unnaturally long life which continued in Korean cups even after it was removed from ladder
Because it was such a good map along with KSS
Overgrowth never forget RIP
Had such a high win percentage on that map FeelsBadMan
I think Overwatch was the best map of SC2 so far I really can t think of another that could compete
I miss Antiga and Daybreak T T
Overgrowth was an amazing map People did get sick of it because it stuck around for so long but it was so balanced If they ever do another dream pool I hope we see it again
I want Antiga Shipyard back c
Blizz wants UNIQUE maps e g Maps with all GOLD bases Main Base with Huge OPEN RAMP MAin with BACK ROCKS ON 3 SIDES
Whirldwind anyone
Oh yeah the cannon rush on your natural with the powering pylon on the third was a delight to play against I hated overgrowth for this thing only Otherwise great map
I agree with a lot of the maps people say they missed but to be honest those maps were never on the same pool to begin with Many of them were years apart even Most map pools had one or two maps that people really liked while the rest were considered bad or just not memorable I can t remember a time when the community was happy with the map pool overall
Why think fondly of the most boring and over exposed map of all time Keep the game fresh and keep maps diverse to force different strategies and experiences
Holy fuck yes
one of the best maps of all time for sure I really hope Blizzard realizes that maps can be unique without having some gimmick i e gold 3rd base
FUCK YES I COMPLETELY AGREE I MISS OVERGROWTH Edit ALL THESE MAPS SUCK ASS
I too loved OG but remember how much people were ranting at it for being too old too standard and shit The community killed itI m not sure what you re getting at
SPOILER The Destruction of Lilbow Part II is just as predictable as the Hangover part II was to the original Hangover When is part III going to be I hope it ll be as entertaining and predictable as the Hangover part III will be
Maybe the old reliable stuff doesn t work as well anymore You don t see protoss players really complaining that they can t really use colossus anymore It s a different game now there are still old strategies you can use but you re going to have to tweak and experiment with the new stuff especially since MMM isn t as strong as it was in WoL and HotS Even I can t use ling bling muta vs Terran all the time especially due to larva nerf
I just want to say that at least SC2 continually gets free maps at least 2 3 times a year Some games don t even get new maps and those that do often you would have to pay for them This is not to say that we can t criticize maps just because they are free though I agree somewhat but to ask for a compromise saying we should have a larger map pool only to then say 5 of those maps should be weird and have just enough vetoes to get rid of those maps isn t really much of a compromise 9 maps should be good enough with 3 vetoes and 4 non standard maps I don t play at the highest level of play and most people don t either and I do often get bored sometimes if everything standard I enjoy having to think a lot about the map I m having to play on That s also not to say that you don t think on standard maps but I do like it when it does change a person might have to play
I would say my favorite is probably Whirlwind forgot about Frost I think I liked Frost a little more
Put some Liquid to put that fire out p
So Euro league for the most part kappa
Didn t you know even arguing against Koreans means you re racist
The Korean successes of 2013 and 2014 were really at the cost of the EU and NA scenes more NA than EU really EU was a little more safe due to it being 1 NA pro s skills were already in decline or stagnant by 2013 2 it s easier for Koreans to play from Korea to NA than to EU due to lag Also EU was also always guaranteed a spot in Premier League ro16 the offline event whereas due to the proliferation of Koreans it was already extremely really hard to make it Remember that WCS NA was known as mini GSL due to some Koreans like TL HerO TL Taeja Bomber I think all of Axiom and a few others like Pigbaby being there The non Korean scene did not have the room needed to grow and foster talent especially when the Koreans started to come more and more to global tournaments The scene really stagnated when non Koreans became less competitive There were just way too many Koreans coming and going without helping the scenes they were competing in Are they obligated to Of course not But I don t think you could honestly expect non Koreans to even stay on the same skill level as Koreans without consistently playing against them and you cannot reasonably expect most non Korean players to have to stay in Korea for meaningful amounts of time to practice So that s were we are now a non Korean scene that has to for the most part stabilize and recover itself for the long run while the Korean scene unfortunately this time has to take a hit
Also they need someone to moderate seriously keeping people focused on the topic instead of veering off and without it devolving into it personal attacks
It s either all sunshine and rainbows or it s the end of SC2 as we know it Holy shit r starcraft it amazes me how we are so extreme in our feelings collectively Wave after wave of oh it s a ded gaem or it s all good and dandy guys we re trying to do things to change situation we ll be fine It then changes to it s not enough It s too little or it s too much It s too risky Yes things need to change No one here is disputing that As the community we are so fucking negative We lash out at Thorin we lash out at the other esports that have become bigger We lash out at Blizzard We scream and yell at each other We last out at organizers community figures and everyone or anything to do with Starcraft No wonder for the most part community figures don t really engage with us here on reddit It s either we re too positive or we re too negative We re so sensitive to everything It s like we can t ever have fun and remain calm enough to actually have discussions Life got arrested It sucks Does it look really bad Yes Do we know what he got arrested for No Are some of us jumping to conclusions and predicting the fucking end of SC2 Yes Could it potentially be really bad Of course Could the opposite be true Yes of course Before we predict the end of everything let cool heads prevail We DO NOT KNOW what Life got arrested for
Painuser is Luke Skywalker we need to find him
You should all play zerg fuck protoss and terran p
Suppy was streaming a little while ago Xenocider has been streaming sporadically Both are still on EG but are both in college so that takes priority
Pretty much agree with what you wrote except I don t know if the community was directly responsible for the rivalries disappearance It was more that the non Korean players like Snute or Bunny who are were pretty good don t have the ego they re more humble and quiet
It wasn t viable for every single foreigner who wanted to compete to have to go to Korea In my opinion it would ve been better for Koreans who wanted to compete outside of Korea to spend time practicing outside of Korea Teams instead of just using Koreans to get them tournament wins should of built teams around Koreans and have them practice with non Korean players Not only was it money that was being lost it was also potential skill that was being kept within Korea The skill gap has only grown and with that the ability to compete and with that the ability for money to be earned and money from more regional sponsors I don t think we chased out rivalries it s more like they ceased to happen Idra and Huk s skill didn t proportionately increase as much as MC s did as the years went by MC still could kind of compete with better Koreans whereas HuK and Idra tended to get beat more soundly EG vs TL wasn t happening as much due to team leagues being all but gone and EG s focus away from SC2 talent We went to more subdued rivalries that aren t quite as exciting The last interesting one we had was Scarlett vs Bomber Can t even think of an interesting rivalry in 2015
From the non Korean player perspective I think the players felt like tournaments WCS 2013 14 EU and NA dedicated to them were being taken away by Koreans while the outside tournaments were also being increasingly dominated by Koreans as well Koreans had their GSL and really no non Korean players would compete in them due to probably two huge reasons they d have to live in Korea and the skill gap was huge All the while without region locking by season 3 of WCS 2014 there were 10 Koreans in EU and 16 Koreans in NA I find it reasonable to believe that players in both NA and EU were probably incredibly disheartened and discouraged by these events I don t believe that it was due to the general belief that non Koreans players were simply not working hard enough There will always be cases of this but generally speaking I don t believe that If there were only a handful Korean players in both regions I doubt that most players would slack off They d see it that they have more of a chance more of an equal skill range like in WCS 2015 For example Lilbow s Blizzcon performance aside I d wager his deep run in season 2 WCS 2015 encouraged him greatly to practice hard knowing that he could possibly take the championship Then you contrast that with his lack of interest in even practicing for Blizzcon where he would play Life because of the perceived and quite truthful assertion that Life was on a different level a higher Then Blizzcon happens and Life 3 0 s Lilbow in quite a laughable fashion From my own perspective where I ll watch any high skill level of play whether it be Korean or non Korean they are all better than me anyways it was always in a way anti climatic knowing that a Korean was nine times out ten going to win a tournament It was just a matter of which one And then it came down to are any of the Korean players one of my favorites Like is Liquid Taeja going to start another summer of Taeja Will Jaedong win the big tourneys I respect players like o Innovation Maru herO etc but I don t really get up to watch them play because of how high skilled they are So back to the point what was wrong with 2013 2014 It really depends on a person s perception For me I saw it as a decline of the non Korean scene which hurt the global scene incredibly but at the same time a huge flourishing of incredible Korean talents when KeSPA came in I ll never forget 2013 as it has some of my favorite moments of all time Jaedong and his myriad of second place finishes Scarlett vs Bomber at Red Bull Battlegrounds and when she made her deep run in WCS Taeja vs Innovation well actually Taeja vs anyone Grubby winning versus Mvp TLO vs Squirtle the baneling land mines We won t really get a lot of these non Korean vs Korean moments that I love or even another Summer of Taeja a man can hope this year until maybe Blizzcon That sucks I mean that really sucks but as a fan of the game who doesn t watch any other esports game I believe that this year although harsh to Koreans it s for the best Something had to be done I don t know if this is the best way but we ll know if it was for the best or for the worst in the future What I do know is that if SC2 is supposed to have a global scene like it wants to it has to have global competition That by no fault of Korean players there needed to be better protection of talent outside of Korea Sorry for the long rant just felt like I had to get something off my chest
I just want to highlight one thing you said criticize and communicate correctly Too many people here are way too dramatic going to the extremes of arguing instead calmly attempting a discussion of ideas It s like everyone is always yelling at each other not really wanting to discuss but to be always right about what they say
Hey hopefully it could be as only as bad as Stephano getting arrested right
According to some on this subreddit the rest of the world is white outside of Korea
You mean Korean and white because of some people in this subreddit making this just about racial issues
I don t think he was really in it to argue but to moderate
Scandinavia isn t in NA silly
Should of threw da bomb insteadI feel like there really should be a huge discussion about the korean scene as a whole at this point You have to remember that these kids join esport teams before they are adults probably even neglecting any education for the most part They live in the team house training countless hours and don t even get a decent salary unless you are the superstar I am not surprised that such an environment would create matchfixing not saying that ONLY in these circumstances matchfixing is a problem but it certainly helps Obviously in Life s case this doesn t fit the picture but if we believe other statements Rekrul some foreign progamers there is a lot more shady stuff going on beyond the surface Nobody ever talks about the questionable enviroment though i feel that should change Maybe i misrepresent the whole thing with this post if i do so pls correct me but that s what i feel atm
This probably has a whole hell of a lot more to do with Korean society in general than it does with just the Starcraft 2 scene The fact that illegal gambling rings can operate so boldly says a lot Life could lose his entire career loads of his earnings and will probably have a tough future ahead of him Where is the talk about the brokers and the gangsters facilitating this to happen so frequently and so blatantly Children are frequently offered thousands of dollars by adults and the children who accept lose everything As a side note life is only 19 years old Did you understand what 500k meant when you were that age Also he s still living in a team house in less than ideal conditions for a normal life so it s not like he s living the life of someone earning 100k year That money must be so abstract to him if he even still has it
I don t know about Korean culture specifically but in most Asian cultures it s expected common that you pay back your parents in one way or another Depending on how much you earn it s pretty much a given that you pay some sort of allowance to them until you re married I d be surprised if most progamers didn t pass along a large portion of their earnings winnings to their parents I don t think Life kept the 500K for himself
It s a given Look at MC MVP and all the big name players What do they do with all that money Goes straight to their parents or at least a significant chunk of it Here in America yeah it s a lot more about me me me mo money mo money mo money But in Korea the respect towards your elders is deeply ingrained The culture is enormously different and something I dare say many Americans wouldn t really understand
Illegal stuff happens all over the world man You can t blame korea for having a illegal gambling scene It s entirely Life s fault that he decided he wants to be a part of it
So your point is that they shouldn t bother trying to improve conditions or go after the illegal gambling rings I assume this just means gangsters because it s entirely up to 19 year old life to push away their demands for his entire career Great
I m not saying they shouldn t fight against illegal gambling rings Just that it s 100 Life s fault and not theirs Let s take the war on drugs as an example Gouverments are fighting them but it s just not as easy as you make it seem And yeah it s the fault of a 19 year old if he decides to take drugs and not the dealers gouverments edit Actually players like Life are the ones that create the illegal matchfixing scene Not the other way around And it s not because progamers have a a hard life Life is a superstar and probaly made more money than any other 19 year old It was pure greed that lead Life into the illegal scene
You don t have any insights in the case How can you get to such conclusions We know nothing about the case we don t know If they preasured him into doing the match fixing At this point we are in no position to put all the blame on someone the whole thing too complex to be put down this easy I don t know anything about the gangs u Throwawayaccount 047 is writing about And I don t think that the Korean administration is NOT fighting them
Illegal gambling is just one of those things which seems to come hand in hand with organised crime It is an assumption but one based on examples from many other countries and of course wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki Crime in South Korea
You don t understand u throwawayaccount 047 s point It s hard to put all the blame on someone who probably doesn t really understand how much 400k really is because he lived all his young adult life in a gaming house and have not known what living alone paying for your stuff is like It s also the State s concern that its population doesn t turn into criminals or in this case illegal gamblers or match fixing athletes It s not their responsability if it happens but it becomes theirs too when they let it happen
yea let s blame the fucking kid because he obviously thought yay i wanna be a part of this Teenagers being bet on winning and losing at an international game with thousands of dollars at stake that does not fucking happen everywhere and obviously in Korea it is attracting the attention of criminal groups who have professionals that know how to fucking convince a kid As if this is the hardest thing they had to do
If he did engage in match fixing you really have no idea what the stakes and rewards were He very well could have been more than happy to accept deals depending on how much money was involved and his disposition towards the game You don t know him neither do I and neither of us understand the situation The world isn t as ethically and emotionally simplistic as your favorite anime Life the person is probably more complex than its 1 dimensional protagonist Nineteen is young but it s old enough to understand risk and consequence
Look I don t know you don t know but it is more than likely that a lot of manipulation was involved heck this happens to be even true on car deals and imagine now what gangsters can do He had no reason to accept the deals with the amount of money he was making
I honestly disagree I think we re probably both American and grew up with totally different environmental and societal pressures on us The choice was less his than it would have been ours had it been offered to us in America at that age
I m sure when the full details come out we ll hear about the others involved Remember the whole Prime thing In the full report it mentioned the people involved that weren t from the sc2 scene and they got punished pretty hard I think The community will obviously focus on the sc2 players involved but I don t think it s correct to say that people aren t talking about the gangsters that are involved
where did that large number even come from
the air i dont even know how anyone knows the reason for his arrest why would the police release that to the public
what needs to change is the atittude of programers that they need go in to a team house and should dedicate the entirity of their life to starcraft 2 starcraft 2 can be so depressing to watch when you think about the horrible life prospects of the players especially when they lose a match
we actually can t tell how the match fixing is done how s the approach on the players what pressure they receive what promises are told I don t know man for guys like Yoda and BB I kinda understand easy money easy way but Life
My point is that the korean scene seems kinda shady even without matchfixing if you think about it Kids join proteams and don t even get a decent salary for it I mean you could argue that they get exploited In Life s case this is less of a motivation because he is a big superstar in the context of sc2 but overall i can definitely see WHY some of these guys feel the need to earn some extra money The whole scene doesn t feel stable and respectable when you look at it this way As i said i am sorry if i misrepresent the environment somebody with more knowledge someone closer to it can definitely correct me
We can even look into other countries in that region when it comes to practise environments This things is Not a esport thing I would more say its more of a Hierarchy where young minds become products of persons with interests extreme example but point made
Well i am not saying this is exclusive to korean esport but i hardly see anyone discussing it Which is wrong imo
What would you want to achieve with talking about it Just curious
Hashtag activism lets talk about something over which we have no control or impact so we feel better about ourselves
I simply think it s always better to discuss problems instead of sweeping it under the mat It probably won t change anything though i get that
Well said Chobra StarCraft is a wonderful lovely thing and it s disappointing to see all the bad news and negative vibes lately
It is a lovely game But for those who wish to view it as a career it is indubitable that this news will weigh heavily on whatever few that is
It is both my career and Chobra s so I think that sense may be a little overblown
You are already in it an invested party For you to fight on would be a consequence of your commitments and unyielding stance For a prospective amateur or less unwavering enthusiast the situation is bound to differ
Maybe The news is unfortunate but even in a worst case scenario Starcraft will survive this pretty easily imo
We have statements like this but we are still not sure if Life is really guilty or not Am I right
He s been brought in by the official police It s very very likely he ll be convicted
esports police Constable Artosis
Kespa has investigated match fixing before by themselves this is far more serious
It s crazy that criticism would have almost 2 different meanings that would both apply here I like the second one better you like the first one better that s fine crit i cism krid siz m noun 1 the expression of disapproval of someone or something based on perceived faults or mistakes he received a lot of criticism synonyms censure condemnation denunciation disapproval disparagement opprobrium fault finding attack broadside stricture recrimination More 2 the analysis and judgment of the merits and faults of a literary or artistic work alternative methods of criticism supported by well developed literary theories synonyms evaluation assessment appraisal analysis judgment More
I think it s interesting the way that official definitions mutate based upon a consistent usage Both definitions could certainly apply and I don t believe the sentence would particularly change The first definition explicitly conveys negativity while the second and original definition as far as I know became so associated with negativity it created the first While it s mostly inconsequential additional definitions seem unnecessary in these situations The example sentence he received a lot of criticism shows the ridiculousness of the first definition Receiving a lot of criticism implies negativity because one may be less likely to provide advice pertaining to an already strong work piece idea etc It is difficult to improve upon good and generally easier to understand and convey the faults of a mediocre or sub par thing whatever that thing may be It s like the often complained about recent redefinition of the word literally The redefinition to mean in effect virtually is unnecessary because the word used in this regard with intentional hyperbole The meaning of the word has never changed and in fact its use as a non literal expression relies on its definition as being exact otherwise the phrase has no potency or comedy What s annoying is that the first definition of criticism adds unnecessary redundancy to my post A mocking criticism is a judgement or analysis that is intended to be mocking and is therefor an expression of disapproval Anyways fun observation gg
I hope so he s my favorite player and has been for years
Same here hope he comes out clean however unlikely it may be starting to seem
There isnt a big reason for that hope At the moment he is at the same spot as 4B and Yoda They havent been at a curt when we all called them matchfixers but a prosecutor had enough evidence to bring it to court and KESPA called them out 98 of the prosecutors files are won in front of courts Life is in prison the evidence must be really solid or else you dont get arrested and treated like that in Korea There is a reason why statements like this are brought But just like Yoda and 4B the evidence is so pressuring that he sits in prison and looks very grim It is the right moment for such statements even they wount help in the decline
It s B4 not 4B
Doesn t matter Kespa have a 0 tolerance policy on this The moment you are arrested you can t participate any Kespa sanctioned event
go play some sc2 sc2 community nah too stressful i just watch
Even tho I know that he s right I still feel horrible about this sAviOr used to be one of my favorite players back then and this strikes an awfully familiar note Right now I just want to cry Life heh will go on but not right now
I m glad chobra wrote this I certainly needed to read it I m glad he s still active in the scene
It s not like he died lol
He may as well have
ma bonjwa is dead to me
Guys do we have Brendan Dassey in custody Can we pin this one on him too Just this once
I m not caught by shock and awe about this news and it s not cause I always suspected Life It s just simply that it can happen to anyone How the fuck can it happen to anyone To get caught Or to be a match fixer
Both Match fixing exists in esports way more than we actually know Very few get caught though
My point was that it can t happen to anyone And it s absurd to say it can It besides the point how much get caught because if you don t accept the bribe you will not be in a position to get caught And to absolve Life with a saying it can happen to anyone is that real life pun intended
if you don t accept the bribe you will not be in a position to get caught Maybe the people offering the bribe dont take no for an answer if you know what I mean They are hardly playing by the law kind of guys in the first place
If you think that this is a take no for an answer situation you are living in a ferry tale moooooseknuckle i wasn t referring to his gilt or innocence but the comment that it could happen to anyone that i found funny and not true
The point isn t to absolve him If he s innocent he ll be back If he s guilty then he s gone and will be penalized accordingly There s no need to dwell on him just move on
There have been various match fixing incidents in different games SC2 is hard to matchfix on because you have to do it for cash in other more popular games kappa you can bet skins and various items therefore getting a quick reward You can do it in many ways without ever getting caught One very popular incident that happened was the IbuyPower controversy in CS GO Google it It s just one of the many that have happened and yet very little have been found because it s incredibly easy to cover your tracks when you re match fixing The only reason that incident went public is because an angry ex gf of a player spilled the beans on twitter about it all If it was not for her we would ve never known
I m sure when the full details come out we ll hear about the korean scene as a whole at this point
Good read Gonna hit that ladder New Season hype
I have to say that even if Life is matchfixing I ll remember his beautifull plays and I will always respect the skill that he has shown fake or not I m maybe overly positive or it is maybe just that I don t really care about matchfixing what I mean is that I m only in the scene through the game reddit and the tournaments that I am watching and the fact that Life has matchfixed is not a big deal for me because it has not destroyed my previous experiences related to sc2 I hope to see a skilled Life on LOTV and if not I hope that a zerg as skilled as him takes his place and contributes to my enjoyment
He s still one of the best zergs in the world if not the best Choosing to fix matches assuming he actually did was a shitty thing to do but that doesn t diminish his skill as a player I agree hopefully the charges will be dropped and he ll come back or else hopefully someone else steps up and takes his place
Yeah it s kind of retarded how some people say it shows the state of the scene I mean there is this kind of scandal everywhere in every large sport or esport It s sad but it happens The issue is that this kind of situation seem to happen more often in Korea
I wish he had something interesting to say
Watch a movie Build a snowman Go to the beach
right on Chobra
It s kind of brilliant actually Life always wins except when he deliberately loses
Brood war was fun to play and watch Starcraft 2 is absolute shit
he always suspected Life uhh
This reads like he always suspected Life but that s not the reason he isn t caught in shock and awe I am no native speaker though so maybe i am wrong Either way he surely didn t mean it that way

Special tactics
Thanks for the context
This was just the beginning White ra had a TLO esque penchant for weird protoss timing attacks and really became known for special tactics in WoL It was a great meme
We make expand and then defense it
ARtosis pylon and HuK to 3 control should go much further
These were actually all polls voted on by the community
team liquid net is known for their extensive use of memes
Thread can be found here If you disagree then you disagree with the people who voted not OP http www teamliquid net forum starcraft 2 321344 over tl esports bracket
Ya the TB hat makes no sense I mean I love the guy but there was never much of a meme revolving around his hat Let alone a meme which would top the tosis pylon
I hear people say artosis pylon very regularly Never heard someone say TB s top hat
I only ever associated it with his twitter pic Didn t know he actually ever wore one
he stopped somewhere in 2012 long after the esports bracket happened TB has a bigger fanbase than artosis so obviously hes gonna be voted higher
Poopfeast420 is way better than special tactics lets be real
Trumpets for life oh the memories
Artosis Pylon out in the first round Heresy
That s what happens when you have an artosis pylon All it takes is one thing to go wrong and you re out

Turns out Day9 trumpets is top 2 control

Well maybe people are sick of saying NERF PYLON OVERCHARGE for like 3 months now
i dont think pylon overcharge is even OP i just think it is a silly game mechanic same for tankvacs i feel like theyre changes youd make in an arcade map for fooling around theyre just so ridiculous
I ve heard there s a new terrain unit with a mop and cleaner that walks around and cleans up creep but then the floor is slippery so Marines can t walk on it
Not nerf remove
Precisely the kind of retarded crap we must contrust against
sounds like non contrusive feedback
eh I dunno I think it has a place and it helps protoss deal with harassment which they really struggled with before It just shouldn t be able to defend any attack before the 20 minute mark Weaken it and make it less spammy
They need to nerf that OR adepts not both This just makes toss early game shit again
You mean to tell me not being able to expand and having to spend gas on sentries while terran and zerg safely expand and harass with tier 1 units wasn t ideal
oh no do you have to build units to defend your expansion why cant pylons just do it all
Why can t stalkers cost 50 minerals with tier 1 upgrades that make them 2x 3x as good
Because a stalker is way way stronger than a marine
David Kim has the patience of a saint There s no way I could deal with the 1000 s of gold league heroes thinking they understand the game and know EXACTLY what needs to be changed
I want you To take balancing seriously Edit This thread is 100 separate from the balance feedback So the comment that has points below me makes no sense whatsoever This was also a joke SC2 reddit is unreal
You are one of the people whose feedback is so uncontrustive that you only make the job harder
Whoosh
How does that make any sense at all when I am not even giving feeback on any of the balance changes This thread has nothing to do with the feedback for the game whatsoever so what are you actually getting at And obviously my comment was a joke
Your post implied that he doesn t take balancing seriously It was a clear and direct criticism of David Kim ergo it was a criticism of his balance changes along the line of You aren t taking the changes you make seriously Unless you intended it differently in which case you should have written it differently
It was a joke that wasn t even near the feedback thread or post Get real
If you don t understand what you yourself say then don t say it
Take a joke Stop taking things so seriously It s just the internet Don t worry about what I said D
I wish the mods banned dumbfucks like you from this subreddit

Can you rewrite this in English please
No new maps for you
What uncostructive feedback he is talking about Sorry not following the game lately But when I was leaving Kim had kind of shitty reputation and it wasn t completely undeserved Does that changed
You weren t listening to us back in 2010 Our patience has ended Hope you re happy what you did to our game Because we aren t
Hey David what about analyzing DATA as hard evidence instead of listening to peoples rant Yunno doing your job
Should have gone with Alarak and been more assertive
Well it s not like Blizz is doing anything we expect them to do like new maps leave league bugs other stuff blizz promised
Honestly they should be thrilled that they re getting so much free feedback regardless of positive negative Some businesses have to pay a fortune to understand customer sentiment and DK s team get it for free then complain about it If they don t have the infrastructure in place to filter it and separate signal from noise and or it s causing poor morale that s entirely the responsibility of their management teams not the customer s problem Insinuating that their recent minimal efforts to have some dialogue with the community aka transparency are to fault for unrealistic expectations and not the fact that Blizzard themselves hyped these features is laughable Asking the community of paying customers to lay off on their harmful internet words was pathetic and frankly just came off as more PR intended to obfuscate the fact that Blizzard s focus isn t really on this game although they continue to pay it lip service If what we re seeing really represents the efforts of a full team I don t know what to say The right response when your customers complain en masse is to say that you totally understand where the complaints are coming from will make every effort to expedite changes the community wants but make no guarantees and then proceed in the best way forward for the business after understanding the cost benefit of addressing the user complaints ahead of your slated development calendar Unfortunately it looks like Blizzard s cost benefit analysis is consistently falling on the side of less investment in SC2 but taking passive aggressive shots at the community is weak regardless
He is the worst thing to ever happen to starcraft
Why is that As someone who doesn t follow this very closely I d be interested to read a nice write up
Oh Fuck off
He hasn t had a mind for balance in a decade He made a few good suggestions in sc1 but that s it
you re not mildly funny you re completely unfunny
I actually found that quite funny
I wish i had a job where i ask other people to do it for me
here is additional constructive feedback give us ghost skin for nova now pls I pre bought only reason is because of skin I don t care about the campaigns I shit you not I want to rush protoss with female ghost bitchs david kim pls
English pls
he sucksSorry but this game is balanced by front page reddit threads not actual numbers P players need to whine harder if they want a playable race
PvT 277 242 53 37 PvZ 386 438 46 84 TvZ 360 333 51 95 copy pasted from aligulac from most recent
But that being said please don t become whiners y all It s so pointless and demeaning when people whine at every drop of the dime Not only does it make those of us who still come here die inside a little each time we do it wastes the time of the devs who have to sifting through all of that crap in their quest to find constructive feedback
Looks like we have no choice I want a playable race man
This this this this this this this
Why does it always go this way When PvT was protoss favored the entire frontpage was filled with these nonsense posts But when it s terran favored no one bats an eye This is ridiculous and the terran bias is sickening Protoss players really got to stand up and whine more maybe we need an avilo of our own
Since patch 1 3 except for a very brief dip for the HotS release I don t see this graph go below 45 for PvT while it does appear to hit 55 twice Anything in the 47 to 53 range should be expected The ways you won TvP such as SCV pulls and the ways you lost TvP too many to list made the game unfun to play There is a difference between not having fun because you lose and not having fun because you had to do a checklist of things of every game or else you lose
It s kind of funny how Protoss players are whining more about Terrans whining about their 49 TvP than they whine about their own 41 PvZ And you can almost argue that the former is a bigger problem to whine about anyway
Why is that shocking Terrans were making out that TvP was unwinnable and that Protoss was broken as fuck when in fact when if you surivied past the early shit Protoss had an almost impossible army to fight against bio with tanks and liberators It seemed so outrageous how much complaining they where doing because it was from notable figures and all over Reddit to a level that Protoss never has That it rubbed a lot of Protosses like me the wrong way ZvP is fucked but then that seemed obvious and making ultras and lurkers basically invincible seemed like something they would ofc fix but no Well GGWP Reddit and Terran pro s alike I just hope a Protoss wins no other tournaments for fear of more nurfs
This reddit has far more terrans than protoss Just watch the votes on this post
You re right but I m not sure whether to upvote or downvote you
It s reverse psychology to get the terrans to give me karma Already working to the tune of about 2
please tell me the last time period when pvt was terran favoured
Month of January 2016 as statistics show
Pvz has never really been protoss favored not anymote than when the was Terran favored
also all of HotS after the widowmine patch
deleted
1 supply roaches come to mind when thinking of things more broken than broodlord infestor
Speed voidrays too Sweet jesus those were the days
Late game wasn t super prevalent in those days though
Beta
nah broken was when there were barracks before supply depots
I don t know why you are getting down voted Terran had a 33 wr vs zerg at the end of WoL It s not nearly as bad as the broodlord infestor days
WARHOUNDS
if you look at history part right now PvZ is 47 learn to use websites
No I also posted match statistics and tha graph is from beginning of January PvZ Is 46 8 from January 20 now so you do want the fork
Ya the graph hasn t been updated but you re right I m eating my words with a side salad right now tasty
And yet at high levels of play PtitDrogo wins Dreamhack over zerg and in Code A Protoss players are holding their own just fine in PvZ Also CJherO and Myunsik won both of the GSL preseasons herO beating world class zerg on the way In terms of actual gameplay Protoss has a lot of potential with phoenix into chargelot archon immortal They can also mix in warp prism adept harass which requires a very different reaponse from zerg than phoenix Somehow the stats say zerg is massively favored but it s not showing in top level gameplay or results
IMO The style that they use is just too hard for people below low master Yeah it is successful but demands a ton of multitask heavy macro even under pressure you have to always harass the zerg your phoenix can t be inactive more than 15 20 seconds PICA style and the only one that really works against zergs is really about having an excellent macro multitask to be successful And in the other hands zergs just go for roach ravager or lurkers without having to do anything but bases and drones But if you look at the GSL PvZ is 40 60 so there is still something wrong i guess And with the new PO nerf i would really like to see how korean pros handle early pools or even speedlings all in
Sounds like BW where if you could multitask like Bisu PvZ was easy
Except for when you get hydra busted
It isnt hard to execute Whats hard for lowbies is not running their entire army into lurkers and dying Its the same reason low ranks complain about disruptors all the time If you re not watch your army and dont preemptively position your units youlre gonna have a bad day
Well if you miss the harass part pressure presence on the map you won t be able to do anything
I think what you re saying is if you re can t put pressure on the map then the zerg runs rampant Or am I misinterpreting you If it is the above then ya I agree that keeping pressure on zerg is pretty hard as toss WPadept is helpful and will remain so but zerg s defensive capabilities are really strong with roachrava if it isn t any kind of multiprong harass or if the zerg has awesome creep spread
I don t say it s hard well i mean it is when you are mid master with 200 EPM If you can put some pressure on the zerg without letting your mineral reach 1k you are fine if you can t well you might get a little bit rekt IMO PICA is the only build efficient in the current meta macro build cuz as always all ins work quite well Phoenix opening to prevent muta i won like 20 games this season just by doing the double stargates opening because a lot of zergs are going fast muta without scouting the protoss because they are expecting some kind of zealot immo or adept immo all in And anyway now mutalisks are just way too scary to handle without a fleet of phoenix Archons for aoe vs speedlings and ultras and they are effective versus anything anyway cuz of their biologic bonus damage Immortals to annihilate roaches ravagers but you need sentries as well in the mid game and prevent or immediately kill the ultras Chargelots to kill the rest and you need to warp a lot of them in the zerg base while you are fighting with your main army again multitask With some storms and tempests for bullshitlords transition this seems to be the best composition you can get in PvZ But like i said you need a really good an excellent even to get that out in time and multitask to not let the zerg spread You must have a total control of the game I quite like this matchup because you really have to scout constantly to know where the zerg is going to get your extra robots stargates in time etc But early pools or speedlings all in are a real cancer the maps pool is probably the biggest issue tho And PO nerf won t help x And btw zergs KR and EU don t have the same gameplay EU zergs are a lot more agressive than KR ones This is MY OPINION not a divine truth so just don t shit on me pls D
Templar tempest is really strong lategame vs BL corruptor viper Oracles are necessary sprinkled in and once you get the right composition just liter bases with cannons The lategame imo only suffers when you let hte zerg remax really quickly Tech switches always favor the zerg
I would say PICA is even broken It s just a lot of people die before getting there So zerg early aggression is as broken Not the best state to be in I m not sure how new PO changes it
With a good army control engagement it is But most of people just think that it is a A moving comp So when they play it they a move and lose and say zerg is OP anyway Without even trying to play it correctly
TBH chargelot archon immortal actually does pretty well when a moved against lurkers as long as it s not up a ramp and or through a choke The chargelots quickly spread and don t take much splash then the archons and immortals can safely and quickly deal huge damage to the roach hydra lurker I play mostly random in LotV and I m certainly not a very high level player I still win a good amount of PvZ by just a moving PICA at zerg and doing some minimal micro such as phoenix lifts guardian shield immortal targeting etc
Mmm I agree with the premise that CAI is a very a movey composition but I have fought similar fights with pre splitting focusing immortals on lurkers and general micro like that and some engagements I ve been pretty lazy with The difference is quite staggering if you don t do at least some micro
Hey I follow the scene off and on What is this PiCA style I m low master NA as Zerg so i know basics of the game and all just not sure what this term refers to Not entirely up on the current meta game really
Phoenix Immortal Chargelot Archon
Thanks
Sorry but Muta micro isn t exactly the same as phx micro please remember u need to individually pick up every thing you want to kill It requires a lot more from protoss also considering to warp in you need to look away from your phx do your warp in and then return to phx micro
Yeah but on the other part mutas are less tanky and you have to be more carefull with your mutas And maybe you didn t notice that but muta players also often individually click on their targets to make it more efficient And as Zergplayer you have to go back for injecting and creepspreading
Dude phoenix are paper and they die so fast to things like hydra
Well they are tankier than Muta They cost 25 more but have 50 more health I don t think it s fair to say that one is harder to use than the other They are both fragile and need to be babysat all the time
Compared to a critical mass of mutalisk phoenix are pretty underwhelming We will see with the new viper nerfs now though
Yeah and know imagin how fast mutas they and how much more carefull you have to be because of that
Still not as hard imo playing zerg is still alot easier right now especially in lower leagues
Its completely subjective and playstyle dependent Ive been playing random in diamond for a long time and i just rush psionic storm in pvz with a 70 winrate
Not really people often make the mistake that some races are easier to play than others but that s wrong it depends mostly on the playstyle You can t say race x is harder than race y without referring to a playstyle Because it s the playstyle which makes something hard or easier
Phoenix micro isn t any more difficult than Muta micro I understand where you are coming from but having to use an ability doesn t make things magically harder Both require constant babysitting and target firing Hint Setup rapid fire for Graviton Beam for an even easier time
Ok a couple things I don t think I m winning at all its just a straight up fact that protoss standard playstyle is currently more difficulty on average then zerg Don t worry about my games I never said I m having problems vs I m fine because I can multitasking and macro unlike most lower level player we are referring to I don t know anyone that uses rapid fire for grav beam and have never seen any pros use it The reason being you run into the same problem as using it on feedback it super ineffecint and could maybe work if you had a ton of phx and nothing but workers in a mineral line but if the zerg was smart he s gonna move roaches or ling around his workers and really mess you up Again you can fuk off with your git gud and try harder bullshit no matter how you look at it if you go mass Muta as zerg your going to have a easier time then going phx You know why low level players complain about Muta being strong still it s to hard to control phx while doing everything else to make sure you don t die to a ground push so they don t make them Throw in the fact you can stack injects now and zerg gets even easier when you lapse on Marco So please learn a thing or two about the races before you make judgment on them
it is kind of ridiculous how zerg can faceroll roach ravager while protoss has to work their ass off to even stand a chance Regardless of where the s end up this is just not fair It s a little reminiscent of PvT a while back when protoss just had to 1a more or less with the colossus deathball but terran really had to micro and macro their hearts out but more severe
If you look at the GSL Protoss is currently the most represented race in Code S If you include the qualifiers there are factors like no names and ex pros being bounced out by existing pros more in some matchups than others They don t all neatly cancel out
weren t the code S qualifiers pre patch before the MSC nerf 41 winrate is post patch
The patch hit on the 29th after code S on the 30th in Korea Not a single Korean tournament game has been played on the patch
There are alternatives for lower league players phoenixes arent really necessary to deal with lurkers which are the main problem for most protosses A really simple way to approach it is by going for an oracle opening with fast 3 bases into chargelot immortal archon then a moving into the zergs army with revelation on the lurkers Only requires basic macro and no micro needed I dont use phoenixes either because my protoss mechanics are still new and awkward making it hard to multitask while macroing well I cant say its enough at GM level since I m not there but works for me in masters offracing as protoss
You do realize aligulac counts like no games Bellow masters right
that s exactly why he s using it the game is balanced at the pro level first
PICA isn t that hard you can literally just amove with ICA Roach Ravager Lurker is harder to handel than ICA Protoss had harder unit comps in HotS like blinkstalker sentry And it s not like pheonixes are that essential in the midgame if you have your groundarmy out And things like heavy macro even under pressure harass etc etc are things which count for every race also depending on the playstyle Zergs also need to have excellent macro maybe a bit less multitasking but more good positioning etc etc You re implying that zergs have it way easier than p which is simply not true Especially ICA is one of the easier unitcomps protoss had in starcraft while the midgame for zergs is harder than ever I think it s more that Lurker and Ravager are so strong and easy to get But it s hard to changes something while protoss does quite well at the toplevel I think the best step would be changing the mappool and make it more protoss favored or at least not so zerg favored like this one and then taking from there
That s exactly what i am saying Protoss do extremely well at high level against zergs because they have the mechanics APM to do so I see a lot of Top master GM ruining zergs in PvZ with this build expect on Ulrena and Prion Cancerraces But below this level of play or without this build it s kind of zerg favored
Yeah and lower level zergs also don t have the apm mechanics of a higher level zergs so it s balances itself out And on lower level there are many things which are inbalanced just because they can handel it Adapts Overlord drops Force Fields Widow Mines are all things which are inbalanced below a certain level What you re essentially implying is that zerg is easier to play that s why they re so strong at lower levels But you have nothing to back this assumption up you just feel that zerg is easier to play
Remember that when you re playing in diamond MMR you re playing against diamond zergs You might not be as good at managing your phoenixes but the zergs will be proportionally worse at keeping the harassment under control as well
You can literally a move ontop of Lurkers with PICA and still win the fight as long as you engage reasonably well and use Graviton Hell if you didn t go Phoenix you don t even need to worry about Graviton and can still win the fight No other ground army in the game can a move Lurkers and get away with it
Well that s not totally true Unless the zerg is caught of guard it s kind of hard Using graviton on lurkers if kind of risky because there are hydralisks just under your phoenix and actually there is a bug that make lurkers insta burrow when they are dropped off the graviton beam when they are attacking and you pick them up when the graviton wears off they insta burrow and continue attacking like nothing happened You can t engage lurkers which are being defensive just impossible because they are well spread zergs amy is in arc and spores are just next to the lurkers So you have to go for the late game with Tempest and Templars But yeah if you catch the zerg in the middle of the map with a good concave and storms you have a really good chance But it s not a moving you have to prepare to engage and choose the right place Map like Dusk Tower are awful vs lurkers because there is not enough place to engage them properly
Yeah they are showing stats of foreign zvp where Protosses dont do Stargate into chargelot archon immortal Honestly Protosses that are bitching just refuse to copy the successful pvz strats from koreans for some dumb reason There is literally no reason not to open stargate phoenix it s the best opening by far for Protoss
PvZ is 42 in the GSL
This includes matches before Protosses learned how to play no While I do think Zerg is slightly favored in this MU from what I ve seen Protoss players just aren t abusing the right tools often enough
Well a ton of that is when adepts still 2 shotted drones larva in the early game before 1 and a lot of P s wins in that were either won or got a big lead because of early game adept rushes sooo yeah Expect PvZ to drop dramatically in GSL as well as across the board Early adept stuff was hiding how low the actually is
Adepts can still 2 shot drones Not being able to 2 shot larva is not a big deal because 90 of the time you are busy with drones Wanna bet that the win rates will go up from now on despite the PO nerf
My bad on the misinformation Still makes no sense that the winrates would go up PO change is definitely a nerf PvZ and the only slight buff toss got was to skytoss and that s probably not something that toss will be able to turtle into in enough games to affect the winrates much I think 2 shot larva matters some I see a lot of pros do it if they can t reach the drones at the time or if they think a bunch of roaches whatever are going to be made soon to defend etc
I bet 50 Imaginary Points they go down
This kind of shit is exactly why looking at the game is useless people will always see what they want to see to justify what they want to be true
I saw plenty of people try that very build at dreamhack to very limited success once the zerg players moved into lurkers more intelligently Once there were 8 to 10 of them with roach hydra support that comp melted like everything else
If you don t have the mechanics for it it s pointless
You want your easy a move win don t you
We want fairness aka amove wins just like zerg gets amove wins for the last 5 years
Fairness http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Premier Tournaments Protoss won more premier tournaments than Zerg and Terran combined in 2015 In 2014 they won seven premier tournaments in a row In late Wings Protoss even during the Broodlord Infestor era still managed to take nearly even tournament wins from Zerg So which it is Are you severely deluded or a troll
Meanwhile you just ignore that when counting winners runner ups it s zerg that has the most in 2015
Right Because runner ups certainly has as much bearing as winners
Exactly They just have 1 series between them and winning out of the 2 dozen they played to get to the finals
I was obviously being sarcastic Look at how many more wins the Protoss got out of ALL those b05 and bo7s and what have you But I know your debate style and how you attribute it all to coincidence Doesn t matter how implausible it all becomes There are no absolutes in this world But what is certain that by percentage and likelihood alone I am much more likely to be correct
Same goes for all the toss who complained about swarmhosts when they were basically unplayable in high level korean matches because korean protosses knew how to use a warp prism
As a zerg I actually find protoss especially opening phoenix pretty weak I almost never lose because I ve figured out what to do Alot of zerg s that I ve been watching don t do what I do They either try infestors which sucks or hydra lurker which sucks vs this as well or go corruptor which is I think the be st the response but they just defend with the corruptors Once I get 10 out I push the phoenix s back by attacking their bases Phoenix tickle me and since they re putting all their resources in zealot and immortal I pick off bases really easily If they move out by 8 30 which is what drogo was doing in dreamhack I already have a sizeable ling baneling army that crushes the size army that drogo would have And ultra cavern is already on the way by 8 30 so by resetting the army it s just too easy to kill protoss at this point One game this exact scenario happened and while he was trying to attack me my corruptors have killed three bases I just find the style insanely weak shrug Also I start greater spire so I can turn those 10 corruptors on the map into broodlords if I want a death army I d be curious to play better protosses But I ve done this vs top masters on NA and on korea
DAE anything besides Code S champs is shit gameplay Also GSL code S champs is shit gameplay if reddit doesn t like the players
When will r starcraft just accept that no one will ever be good at starcraft
Why would you bring up Code S when Dreamhack wasn t even equal to any group in the Code A qualifiers
Code S champd are shit gameplay too unless they were brood war champions
dae foreigners still be shit compared to korea
You can always cherrypick any player who is doing well in any meta and conversely cherry pick any player doing poorly in any meta I don t really follow the non Korean scene very closely so maybe there are things going on there that I don t see but it feels really suspect to draw any conclusions from anything you have cited
Maybe because it s a small sample of the best players Stats about central tendencies of appropriately sized samples
Everything you just said about pro players occured pre patch I think its best to wait a few weeks and see what happens iem tapei proleague gsl ssl but I dont think you can use matches from pre patch to back up your claims the overcharge nerf will probably have a result in a change in the matchup For example cj hero was taking pre 3 mimute 3rd bases in many of his macro wins vs zerg cant see that being possible with the new PO
You sort of misinterpreted what I meant I didn t mean the tactics of phoenix and warp prisms require different units speedling hydra work fine for both I meant the builds of phoenix and warp prism require different units If you try to drone up and go 3 base hydra as Curious did and Protoss does warp prism harass build instead of phoenix then you ll end up taking lots of damage before your hydras even come out If instead you make roaches early to be safe to WP adept then the phoenix will have map control and free harass for a long time Either way if you choose the wrong reaction as zerg you ll end up behind in both econ and tech compared to Protoss I don t want a big argument either because I m not trying to say that zerg is necessarily underpowered in the matchup just that it s actually pretty close to even Besides that game from Curious vs Classic is a perfect example of what I was talking about with PICA style working very well against zerg
And yet departure and dark already showed how to crush the fast third that is the only thing keeping that winrate above 40 Just wait for some more zergs to do it and 41 25
yeh that is the more correct approach look at what high level players are doing who have played loads of games are doing a zvp victory for zerg means a lot less bout balance if it is between two low tier players This is something that isnt accounted for in any of these stats that people keep slinging
dont forget that Neeb crushed violet and huk lost 2 3 to petraeus showtime wrecked firecake 3 0 and harstem 3 0d bly in the WCS something qualifier
Have one third of the playable races balanced at only the absolute highest levels of play is a serious problem given the fact that for 99 of players maining Protoss is completely unfeasible If anything they should be focusing on balance across standard levels of play because who actually cares about professional e sports in 2016
Dude the top level is the only level where balance matters If zerg is easier to play you will just be matched against zergs with less skill than you having even games and everyone is having fun
Oh yes lets nerf overcharge that def wont have big consuquences in the zerg match up
I think its necessary though Overcharge limits both races from pressuring protoss which is why you see them greedily taking 3 base and just throwing pylons down to defend Now protoss will have to use units as well as PO to defend which honestly could lead to some severe protoss losses But at least then they can buff other units to reel the matchups back into balance
And because blizzard only patch one incorrect thing every 4 months protoss will be unplayable for all of season 2
Well they released a few minor patches before this but for the most part 3 months isn t so bad
Explain why Protoss steamrolls Zerg in tournaments
And without it we can t hold any pressure at all nerfing it has made protoss unplayable at high levels
I think what people want is a nerf to the overcharge and a buff to something else At least some unit not a building Blizzard recognizes the great things from BW to include the lurker in LotV and understood Terrans were missing some sort of mobile space control spider widow mine for HotS I think with protoss everything lies with the stalker Singularity Charge from BW so dragoons increased range is so important Just like ling speed stim I m not saying that it should be included i just think an upgrade to increase the strength of toss core units should be made to allow for the mid game madness It is going to be difficult but i think this is where the answer lies Could be wrong though
I wouldn t go so far as to say unplayable It is definitely difficult to win in PvZ but that has a lot more to do with lurkers viper corruptor BL than anything imo Don t get me wrong rorava is a terrifying thing to deal with The fact that there are multiple timings means its not always easy to predict But I think that protosses will just have to find ways of pressuring earlier like with phoenix harass or immortal pressure with recall and maybe take a 3rd a bit later than normal to win games
Those stats are Pre patch means we needed those supidly greedy builds imo In return this will lead to nerfs for Zerg
This is before that too Should be fun to see a race finally get into 30 s winrates
When you stop to think about it holy shit Starcraft is so balanced 41 59 is the worst the game has ever gotten Shit in other games counters are so hard you often have 10 chance to beat your counter much less 41
Yup but it s not the current circlejerk so you never hear about that
This is always what made me love the game and stay loyal since I ve been a little kid Unfortunately many don t see it that way and it s been hard to get my friends into it
Other games don t have only 3 races What a horrible comparison
Well every race in sc2 have many units I is not 3 units or 10 it much more Do the math Kappa
The individual units themselves aren t supposed to be balanced against each other That s not how any of this works
Which just infinitely complicates things
That s just moving the goal post In any other case where counters are 10 they are talking about specific units heroes abilities No other game has a faction that has less than 10 Winrate vs another That s just not how any of this works and is the dumbest circlejerk this sub has thought of in a while Use a single other esports to make a counterargument I dare ya cuz it s not possible
So let s nerf Protoss two best things and give them no buffs BRILLIANT
To be fair the Adept nerf didn t affect PvZ that much The overcharge nerf is huge tho
It s really hard to compete with mass zerglings right now
The adept change doesn t affect that though The adept will always 2 shot a zergling no matter what upgrades either of them has
Honest question at what stage of the game Late game don t you have disruptors and colossi Early game adepts still kill zerglings in the same number of shots so can you make more units Also doesn t the overcharge change kill more zerglings faster
Disruptors are pretty bad vs lings
I could just be bad but I m remembering a game I played where the protoss had chargelots and immortals between his disruptors and my crackling ultras I couldn t get to his disruptors and it was GG Tasteless
Well if the lings get held up behind the Ultras that could be a problem but if the lings are up front and get all over his stuff it s very difficult to land a disruptor shot without killing plenty of your own units
Nobody makes colossus or disruptors these days Chargelot archon is what kills the lings Untill that adepts dont trade cost effectively with lings without the upgrades and making a wall is rather impossible given how greedy you must play
Zerg 2 base 20 25 drones then mass zerglings and maybe banelings You can t really string overcharges anymore so it s hard to make a wall and have a more than 4 adepts and a 2nd base before zerg has about 30 lings
The dmg change did nothing agaunst lings Adepts still trade poorly against lings enmasse Lings have 35 hp Adepts do 22 dmg Before they did 23 In both cases it takes 2 full attacks to kill a ling PO on the other hand was nerfed and due to its delay in attack lings are a bit better at engaging now Morevoer corrsive bile is more powerful againat PO defenses
If you feel adepts trade poorly versus mass lings your either severly outnumbered because of terrible macro and or really mismicroing your adepts because adepts are basically 1 roaches for 25 more minerals and 1 roaches 2 shotting zerglings is practically a free win in zvz In pvz I do tend to defend adept attacks with zerglings because roaches don t do damage fast enough to adepts and adept attacks are all about trying to kill drones so faster killing adepts is more valuable but if I am anticipating a medium to large adept attack I always need to have an emergency bane nest because once a big ball of adepts gets formed you ll lose like 1 3 to half your lings just getting into melee range
You can theory craft all you want but adepts before the attack speed upgrade arent greatbvs lings 4 lings which is way cheaper than an adept can kill her before she kills 3 lings Moreover bile is a far more cost efficient way of dealing with slow moving adepts than banes Banes trsde horribly with adepts
You seem to be theory crafting as well 1 adept beats 4 speedlings when stutter stepped kited In larger numbers Yes adepts don t scale well before upgrades but that is assuming completely in the open engagements with no stutter micro or shade usage Adept attacks almost always involve kiting around wedging between mineral lines and shading between bases adept defenses are similar at the toss base
They only got 1 nerf vs Zerg Don t be stupid
Technically 2 Adept now 3 shot larvae instead of 2 shot Not a big deal but still a nerf p
You re missing a bit the point One nerf only affects PvT and zergs winning because of lurker and ravager are so strong and zergs have in general a strong lategame So the photon overcharge nerf doesn t effect that in any way And it s harder to balance PvZ because despite the numbers protoss is actually doing quite well Maybe a better mappool would already balance the numbers a bit more
That s true your right Hope we see a lurker and ravager nerf soon
deleted
Where did you see this 15 drop
I think there need s to be more maps with free naturals and a third with a chokepoint I m pretty sure the very zerg favored maps are the real issue with PvZ A decent chokepoint would make it easier for toss to defend against zerg all ins while toss does some aggressive harass with wp or air Drops and nydus I think could use some tweaks and maybe do something about ravager bile building damage everything else seems pretty fine though
making turtle maps as a band aid fix for a weak race is a bad idea then the game will be balanced around boring maps and you re stuck with them
Toss just dont whine as hard a terran Terran wont be happy until all matchs up are 99 999 TvX
Perfect example of why no one should other with anything said in r starcraft
It s going to get worse there hasn t been enough matches since the patch to drive the down Give it time it may reach the lowest matchup in the history of SC2 This is not a protoss QQing I just objectively believe this will happen given the fact that early game adept stuff was propping up the already low PvZ s before and now that it s mostly gone the will drop like a rock
the circle jerk is real
A number of Protoss builds could be slightly too greedy now for all we know More games need to be played b c if it s a difference of having 1 extra adept in the mineral line vs speedlings maybe you can delay an extra gateway and suck it up He s committing you commit something to not have to commit completely I have faith high level Protosses will show proper build placement adept usage and the more sparing POs can hold attacks fine with potentially slightly more conservative builds at the worst The question once the dust settles is Is it too much to the point zergs can auto outmacro when forcing certain reactions A number of you are feeling the immediate effects while also experiencing zergs trying to take advantage of that It doesn t surprise me at all that protosses who are so dependent on their BO s and compositions to be tripped up by their first nerf Let the dust settle first imo
Those stats are Pre patch means we needed those supidly greedy builds imo to just hold any ground Now this win percentage is just to go down even more
its offical we need a 10 shield buff on zealots
Protoss fucked up by winning a tournament I would love to see a graph showing the ratio of Protoss s winning tournaments and Protoss then getting nerfed Games rigged
Shouldnt be in a haste and find the exact error first not yet found a new playstyle after adept nerf maps favoring zerg specific units too weak Take the time and find the best solution for this problem also Im sure soon the winrate will increase a little bit again Shotime just 3 0 ed bly with archon immortal style
Those stats are Pre patch
oh rip then D
The game hasn t been played that long Protoss got changed massively Give it time and patience see if it will swing back Also work hard to identify specific situations in which Z won that they maybe should not have Without patience and evidence Blizz likely won t act
MY ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SAYS PROTOSS IS OP PLZ NERF pulls up statistical evidence that opposes opinion THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE IS FLAWED BECAUSE ANECDOTAL REASON
What s hilarious is how PvT plummeted with the launch of LotV contrary to what the b net whiners would have you and apparently DK believe
Its pretty easy Because of their higher winrate vs terrans prenerf their MMR got higher and so they had to face Zergs with higher MMR and so had a lower winrate After the latest nerf the protoss will face zergs on the same level and the winrate will get better When for example you know a cyclone timing which beats every protoss you will get masters with the kills vs protoss but will loose to probably every zerg since every protoss used adepts vs terrans to get easy wins they will have a harder time vs zerg
Those are tournament stats
It s because roach ravager all in and every variation of it is super difficult to hold at almost all levels I ve even seen zergs just 3 base and mass all muta and its completely viable even if you scout spire The reason protoss at the highest level can manage is pro players are able to get adept damage pressure in the early game and gain a very slight advantage For everyone else they just have to manage
This is just misinformation First if we are going to talk about all ins Protoss still have insanely strong all ins they aren t any worse than Zerg s As for 3 base Muta there is no fucking way he can keep massing Muta if you scout it You can hold just fine until Phoenix are out Early on you rarely see more than a small Muta flock because they are easy to counter their real strength lies in sudden tech switches
Name a protoss all in build that can work at the masters level that you can use on 2 bases before the zerg push comes maxed out at 200 200 I have seen a litany of builds from zerg 3 base that are incredibly difficult to hold at all levels Protoss is forced into the same opener every game versus zerg unless they like dying to those tech switches It s insanely easy for any zerg to craft any all in on 3 bases and push the protoss for a kill It takes tons of metagame knowledge and lots of scouting from protoss to hold that push and survive
7 gate Blink Stalker with Warp Prism Works great in close spawn Ruins of Seras and Orbital you can just jerk around the bases and as long as you keep the prism safe from Queens Bile you win Zerg can t stop this unless they scout it Chargelot Immortal all in works on most maps 3 base 200 200 Zerg pushes are not all ins they hit on 8 30 at the earliest Realistically that won t happen unless you leave the Zerg alone for the entirety of the game which is your fault You have easy harass with units like Adepts Prism Oracles and Phoenix This also doubles up as a scouting method This buys you enough time to create an army and do some sim city which is really really helpful vs Zerg
It s really not that hard for zerg to scout any of those builds and I have yet to see chargelot immortal do anything against roach heavy builds and again that s an easy switch into muta which would leave you completely open for an easy tech counter I could see the 7 gate work but that s considering the zerg isn t already doing aggression and you are able to micro well enough and keep your prism alive with ravagers and queens going off If the all in fails you lose the game straight up For zerg they can throw a powerful 3 base at you take a 4th and commit or not and still get good gains It s less about the build orders themselves and more that protoss is pigon holed into 2 star 2 robo builds just IN CASE they decide to throw a crazy aggro build at you I ve seen the damage that can be done with phoenix opener oracle and adepts and its really negligible on the zerg economy unless they are making big mistakes Good zergs or bad are going to use those builds and throw them fierce with good ravager micro or not Now with the pylon nerf that sim city isn t going to do much I ve held the all ins before its all possible for protoss to survive and make good choices but in the ladder meta its simply just stupid how simplistic the zergs builds can be and how overly complicated the protoss builds have to be to hold I don t even try to do anything different in PvZ or I just get steamrolled
You don t need to kill many Drones when harassing Zerg that would just be the cherry on top Forcing him to waste larva on units and keeping him on edge is good enough to severely delay or weaken the eventual push You underestimate the usefulness of chokes against roach or ling based armies imo I can t count the times where I was pushed back due to good building placement despite having a superior army
and what have you calculated for the correct winrate to be if the game were perfectly balanced
Sure but we aren t terrans bitching it up on r starcraft so good luck getting any attention or patches in your favor
I played protoss for 3 years being diamond for a couple season and now I lose to plat zergs on a regular basis caused me to switch to terran and play only unranked very disheartening
Protoss players got lazy during HotS They have to learn the game again now that it s not just EZPZ Force Fields MSC bullshit and Blinks anymore
Just adapt
You are absolutely right Protoss is no longer handed wins as easily and they just complain
Show this to the sheep in Twitch chat and they will still claim Protoss is an easy race that wins because the race exists
Protoss need to learn that they can no longer mass stalker A move Give it a few months for them to adapt to having to use strategy and the win rates will be up Wow downvote as soon as I said that stay salty Protoss D
Zergy is mad hes getting called a patch zerg again
protoss still used to stupidly greedy builds imo what a joke that it was viable for protoss to double expand and hold with some adepts and pylon cannons
Those stats are Pre patch means we needed those supidly greedy builds imo to just hold any ground
still got your brain stuck in hots
so that s the reason I m still in silver league not because I m bad but because Zerg is imba wow thanks inaccurate statistics
Byun is rank 1 player in the world by a huge margin http aligulac com players 47 ByuN Seriously you can t use aligulac without taking it with a large grain of salt
byun actually could be number one now in legacy
aligulac com uses an algorithm very similar to what the ATP adopted for tennis and other individual sport leagues use to rank professional athletes ofc it is not supposed to be accurate when telling who the actual best player is at a given time on the other hand inference they provide based on pure tournament matches win rates are indeed reliable and accurate considering how unpredictable a game such as Starcraft can be
except when people are using an out of date graph showing the balance its currently PvT 277 242 53 37 PvZ 386 438 46 84 TvZ 360 333 51 95 from Jan 20 Now
You re right that the algorithm is similar However the algorithm they use in the ATP has way way more qualitative stats to define the the skill of an individual player We only have winrates Moreover the analytics never never try to claim france is statistically better than britain in tennis with just winrates Yet you come to SCreddit and people always try to prove racial balance using far inferior stats than even tennis use for equating skill Winrates are sadly just a very quantitative stat that doesn t describe much
If No 1 Protoss player has no problem in PvZ that is OK These statistics is useless
flawless logic
Just because one player can dominate doesn t mean that it s balanced It s a testament to his skill not a testament to the balance of the game Look at BW Bisu is an amazing player but protoss is weaker there Just because he can dominate does not mean that it s balanced He could probably dominate even more if things were more even I m not saying that PvZ is imbalanced all I m saying is that if the stats are so anomalous maybe there s something to be looked at Claiming everything is fine is just burying your head in the sand without first investigating And just as taking this particular stat by itself and scream Zerg imba is moronic dismissing it because one or a select few players are doing ok is also moronic IMHO there is something to be looked at here To me it says that the race has design issues that should be fixed there are aspects that can be overly abused which lead to insane winrates but without that abusive aspects the race is simply dead which leads to insane lossrates
Just gonna quit playing ladder until something is done about this fuck it
Literally unwinnable Memes
You re not going to fix the problem unless you rework Protoss Protoss has always been vastly overpowered or stupidly weak never a mixture of the two The Elmer s glue esque tweaks and fixes Blizzard roles out have proven to be ineffective and stupidThe decadence of foreign sc2 in 2016
I eat like shit and even I think that looks gross wtf
This is the result of koreans stealing foreigner money in tournaments With new WCS lets hope morrow will be able to afford some mac cheese in the near future
I would not keep my hopes high after all he s not a REAL PROGRAMER P
This is disgusting
My thoughts exactly
LMAO Just a hint of butter
This kid is going places
WutFace
It ketchup really less expensive than regular tomato sauce
Ketchup instead of actual pasta sauce DansGame morDuck
gross bro
Honey Boo Boo also eats ketchup and butter on her spaghetti
How do you know this
Bc I watch terrible tv On mobile here s link https m youtube com watch v qvlmXKtoi1A
Lol crazy world Thanks for the link I guess
go to the market and get some fresh produce you need it man
ketchup on pasta gross
It s really common in Sweden
And Norway afaIk
Still gross
What s that toilet paper for Morrow Late night fap sessions PvT
I like food too much to eat like that lol Why not eat something better tastier more nutrients and healthier when you re trying to be great at something
I couldn t watch the whole thing The sound of ketchup on pasta made me want to barf
No 1 Champion
morTarga the fuck is that
For some reason I want a player named Tomato to join Team Liquid
A perfect example of when the whole is less than the sum of its parts
Holy fuck that s gross step your fucking food game up pleb
Because ketchup and tomatosouce is so different Almoste all Swedes eats pasta with ketchup
It still doesnt qualify as a meal Tomatosauce expesially home made is totally different in sense of texture and taste Are you on drugs
nutrition wise nope of course not but nether dose macaroni and cheese i just dont se what so discussing with ketchp instead of tomato sauce even tho tomato sauce is better
Amazing camwork
pukes
Holy f that s gross haha wtf
God what happened to the orange jewce
I just threw up in my mouth a little If a pro gamer is willing to practise as hard as they have to to be the best wouldn t they also put in effort elsewhere to fulfil their potential Eating healthy isn t expensive if you go the Soylent Joylent Queal route Probably tastes better thought still disgusting as well
Ketchup DansGame
Ketchup Really breh Butter
That is not a hint of butter LOL
MorroW
i vomited DD
morDuckThat part was so sad to read This community can be so caustic often with little reason
This is nothing You should have seen the r planetside community when they got upset Course planetside has a million and 1 problems that starcraft doesn t
I ve got 99 problems but planet side ain t one
Shiiet shoulda seen r globaloffensive when they released a recent patch Everyone was up in arms about making an FPS game fundamentally more RNG
Well DayBreak did fire their lead designer and the game is in a better state than what it was in when he was there
Higgles Higgles resigned And there as been basically no progress I mean I walked away after the drama got to much in my community They also hired Wrel which is seriously questionable and honestly smacks of desperation
The drama made you leave and yet you are still in r starcraft Holy shit that must have been some next level drama O
That drama was personal
This is true of every game community Satisfied people just don t care enough to post positive comments
There are positive circlejerks in pretty much every gaming community Much more than negatives The negatives just stick out more
Well even then the positives are usually more along the lines of don t change anything its perfect as it is developers are geniouses and released a masterpiece and shouldn t work on it any more instead of hey X was a great addition I really like that do more in the future please My favorite part was Y Like seriously no one ever gives them credit for how amazingly awesome it is that creep goes up the sides of buildings now or that workers just goto work at the start of the game instead of just sitting there going gee I wounder what we are going to do this game Mine minerals nope sit here and wait for orders or how about taking the time to make the carrier into a legit unit for those who liked it instead of removing it from the game since it was unused because the fighters where dumb
It s quite stupid to say they delivered an incomplete product Blizz s games are some of the most polished ever and in terms of content and love put into it they are probably one of the if not the best developers in the world But that doesn t necessarily make criticisms regarding their development speed invalid You just can t deny that over the decade of development time Blizz has put a fraction of new features and content into the game compared to what other often smaller development teams do Actually Blizz is completely known for their long development times Their games come out almost bug free every time and polished to a mirror sheen as a result but that doesn t change the fact that they just sometimes take ages to do stuff and seeing as we have seen other developers do more with less time while keeping up the same quality it s not unreasonable to conclude that there are probably some things in their development process which they could objectively do better in order to be faster without sacrificing any of the end quality or torturing their developers or any nonsense like that I guess my point is that Blizz should understand where this criticism is coming from and apply it to better themselves instead of getting demotivated For Starcraft 2 the criticism probably comes from a place where many in the community are worried because they have the subjective feeling that the game s community is going to shrink away until major features are implemented soon but games like CS GO have shown that games can stay relatively small and then grow to insane levels long after their initial release Actually CS GO is a good example People keep asking and asking about skins and voice packs for example I can t imagine this is so important to people because they don t enjoy the game without them I d rather assume that the people who keep asking about this assume that it s going to trigger some huge growth in the games community just like it did with CS GO And they may very well be right if Blizz handles it correctly
well its like honestly it will probably be better if the changes come out around the same time as Nova in terms of exposure Nova comes out a lot of the less competitive playerbase comes back to give it a go and boom there is a bunch a shit out while Sc2 is back into the spotlight Just a thought but I think it will be interesting to see what happens since they will be coming out near each other
Yeah the timing could be gold there
A lot of it is probably that Blizzard is more corporate in their job culture and they allow their developers to have lives Most companies in the gaming industry monopolize their employees lives and require 65 hour work weeks
You mean less corporate
More good kind of corporate
I always wondered what it s like to be a dev for an online game Work your ass off 8 hours a day go home and read some kid on the internet telling you that you re bad at your job
Honestly probably longer than 8 hours
Pre launch Probably 10 12 hours I can see the hours decreasing post launch since it s no longer crunch time and the focus is on delivering a polished product rather than a polished product immediately
In general all the time 10 12 hours Game development is notorious for having an absolutely brutal work culture Plus the pay is usually absolute shit compared to where qualified engineers could otherwise work Plus the engineering work requires solving extremely difficult problems compared to your typical software development job Game devs take game dev jobs because they love developing games Any given engineer at Blizz could walk into Google for a 1 5 2x increase in salary and great work life balance but they don t Why Because they like developing games That s why it s so shitty to see this community most of whom haven t the slightest clue about what goes into making a game criticize these folks for trying to make a great game
Talking to some friends at Google they re not working any less than the folks at Blizzard It s just a part of the big tech culture That said there s a pretty clear divide in comments complaining about development time between people who have actually touched high reliability scalable code bases and people who think that shit is easy or fast
Google has sneaked in a culture of living at your office and I don t think anyone realizes it s their fault As they continue to add office perks the average observer thinks Oh I want that too But what people don t realize is that if you re eating free breakfast lunch dinner in your office going to the office gym showering and napping at the office and using the office laundry and dry cleaning services you re not really ever at home
Who cares where you eat or do your laundry or nap or shower or whatever Do it where you want Googlers are free to The issue isn t that you re spending 10 hours on a campus of your own volition Google it s that you re spending 10 hours grinding out code because it is a requirement of the job Blizzard Check out the Glassdoor reviews of both companies sometime
You are free to But your boss notices who stays at the office and who doesn t I know what I m talking about I work in the gaming industry and have been in and out of non gaming tech industry for years I know a lot of people who went through Google Apple etc I currently live in Silicon Valley
My hours at the hospital are about 10 14 6 days a week Would gladly accept a park beds laundry and food that s not terrible
i don t think you do know what you are talking about when it comes to the work culture at a big 4 software shop so we ll have to agree to disagree on that one
It s team dependent in a huge organization like Google but in general they do not expect 7 5 hours Lots of friends there too
Work your ass off to feed your family get flamed by entitled kids complaining about a video game Just awful
This negativity didn t fall out of the sky let s be real Blizzard fostered it for years it s gonna be a while before what they ve improved has some visible results in how people perceive SC2 and Blizzard s devotion to the game
Dayvie being the better man
I just hope it motivates them to do more good work
The only reason we even entertained the notion that only 2 guys are working on sc2 or something like that is because it s the only forgivable reason we could come up with that it takes 4 week to fix a tiny thing or 6 months to show visible MMR from now and a million other crappy things we ve endured and are still enduring
Ah so what you are saying is you don t know anything about coding or game development because that s the only forgivable reason for a comment like this
Well their communication has sucked for years Maybe at the time to communication position was vacant P They brought it on themselves for the most part You reap what you sow and for them to reap something more positive it s gonna take a lot of sowing
then why does the heroes of the storm team for example manage to get much more done much quicker despite it being the same engine
They really don t Grandmaster league was announced at Blizzcon for heroes of the storm and Dustin Browder said on twitter a few days ago that they were still months away from implementing it This caused a shitstorm on twitter and reddit This is just a case of the grass is always greener
well im still going to complain because if they spent more time trying to come up with creative units and unit design instead of trying to force creativity through bad maps then I wouldn t complain but DK seems to think that gold bases and rocks are what makes this game creative which is bullshit some of the best games in SC2 and BW history are on very balanced and straightforward maps
complaining and criticizing are ok The way you do it is what matters
So you think this is any kind of constructive feedback They worked on units and unit design for months and even introduced new units during the beta There definitely doesnt go this much time into the selection of maps
I don t think I ve ever seen DKim come so close to straight up telling us to chill the fuck out Glad he said what he did at the end It s very needed tbh
DK has a strong heart and and even stronger back hand
and strongest is his wallet Actiblizzard must pay him a fortune for convincing everyone the community is the problem after saving tons of dev recources by recycling a discarded WoL beta unit
He never said the community is the problem All he said is that non constructive criticism is demotivating and counterproductive Which really isn t news
Blizzard I just want to say that I m enjoying this game a lot and I really appreciate the level of communication we are getting Thank you for a great game and I hope to see more content in the days to come
Make that 2 of us
Ima jump on this bandwagon too
We are legion But we don t make as much fuzz as the angry ones
Well we are busy actually playing or watching the game So we don t have as much time as all the shit posters
LOTV is awesome I m not saying that to be delusionally positive It s a very good multiplayer game Blizzard took big risks and thought the right way and should be rewarded for it There were always going to be haters of SC2 and LOTV and in periods they are going to sound like they represent the community as a whole They don t
Yeah LOTV brought me back to Starcraft I played a ton of WOL then HOTS came out and it was OK but my interest quickly waned I ve already played more multiplayer in LOTV than I did in HOTS
I feel like D Kim is my mom and he is disappointed in all of us for our unproductive criticism But really he makes a good point if people get too upset when talked about stuff hasn t happened yet then Blizzard just won t talk about their plans at all Also anyone saying Legacy was released as an unfinished game needs to play some non Blizzard games and see what that really means
I like how he finally called out all the idiots about the sc2 is a small team and They told us this feature was coming and it s been a month why don t we have it blizzardruinsthegame brokenpromises
That s because the overwatch beta was meant for creating hype not for actual beta testing rofl
Basically all Blizzard betas these days
Basically al modern public betas are balance testing with all the major bug testing sorted out in alpha
nah they asked a ton of detailed questions about my experience right before the beta ended and now I think they are off responding to it all and updating the game Most betas just ask you to vote on a few silly questions to help them figure out how to extract more money from you then roll the game out into the store the next week
Not really it s been offline so long for the very reason they are trying to balance the characters fix matchmaking and alter the maps
Yea it definitely was an unfinished product But the point of betas these days it to garner hype via limited access to a game It worked for them with hearthstone
Betas in multiplayer games tend to be more about balance than about bugfixing
Yeah we can t have it all transparency of future visions accompanied by close to immediate delivery of these future goals The community updates are GODLIKE I can t explain how much they mean it would be a shame to see Blizzard stop being transparent in their ideas just because they have stated some cool visions for the future then leading the community to lose all patience wanting everything to happen right away otherwise false accusations of all kinds are starting It s an extremely childish mindset that only hurts both parties I think the silent majority of people are really positive towards the approach Blizzard takes now with the awesome communication between us and the collective goal of making this game even greater
It would be a real shame if Blizzard reverted to its older self of less communication and less transparency The community really needs to be more mature and accept that Blizzard has their own vision for the game that might not match our own And that s OK
Dkim telling us this is how its gonna be Map diversity is something that blizzard wants to go forward with and we need to accept it and think of how to improve upon the maps and ideas that we have Love seeing Dkim sticking to his guns and responding back to the community
This is so sad how r starcraft changes it s opinion every fcking week There s a bandwagon of people that follow blindly the newest opinion out of anyone known in sc2 community Whenever some known community member says something negative a top post on r starcraft and top comments are how this person is right and FUCK BLIZZARD then someone else bounces the ball back and suddenly everyone protects Blizzard same thing with Thooorin we went from this guy knows shit about sc why is he even getting into it to say what u want about thorin but he is right and today we got again he doesn t know sc2 and his arguments are false or irrelevant this happens over and over again I don t know if on other subreddits it s the same and I don t care but I remember that this place used to not fcking shit on everything after 1 thing that we don t like and we didn t jump into the defence of anybody after he she spoke about the matter Can we please not fcking jump from one extreme to the other every damn 5 minutes
I honestly think most people fall in the middle and stay silent about things I think the problem is that whenever one of the extremes gets an opening to promote their narrative they pounce on it
This is right it s an unfortunate systemic consequence of large online communities
Yeah I m some bored of this shit that I don t answer all these circlejerk threads
nah its NEW I noticed the heroes reddit suddenly becoming much more toxic and displaying the behavior people are talking about here it started when a bunch of people started watching new like a hawk and downvoting anything that disagree with their hurt feelings No new ideas or opinions can make it out on either side the middle ground is completely suppressed only anything the hive find super popular can escape NEW usually by being an extreme view an extremely selfish viewpoint regular popular community shows or internet celebrity backing
Heroes subreddit is hilariously worse than starcraft It reminds me of r starcraft 4 years ago when I was 400 points here constantly getting downvoted whenever I criticized blizzard for LAN or whatever reason But I never got banned for sharing my unpopular opinion while I got banned from Heroes cuz after playing over 1000 games I couldn t accept anymore how pathetically amateur Blizzard are in a lot of cases Later when the hype around the game starts dying out the bandwagoners and morons leave and the circlejerk starts turning around It s the circle of sub lives
Yeah I think it got a huge influx of people from lol dota that shifted after a few streamers antics caught on There are still a large group of then in denile about heroes being a different game than LoL or DoTa Posts that praise the differences or ask the team to try new things get downvoted en mass and anything to make heroes more like LoL or copy and past things exactly from those game without tweaking them on improving on them is the only acceptable answer even if it could have other bad side effects of the game Stuff like LAN was a pretty major decision at a high level stuff like that wont get reverted without MAJOR support or desire from community Letting a few people bitch about it won t change anything and suppressing complaints about it will only ensure it never gets changed It takes blizzard time to get work done that I can accept The only thing amateur about blizzard I feel about that game is how much they hold themselves back trying to pander to their community a complaint a share across all their titles Blizzard puts out its best when they lock themselves away and ignore all the community feedback telling them how shitty the stuff they are working on is and just make it and make it great anyways Then they put it out and discover we love 90 of what they did even the stuff we thought we would hate but blizzard proves they mostly know better than us and we complain about that last 10 and they eventually fix 5 of that Then sit back and ponder while the community rips and shreds the game apart for that last 5 of imperfection an then they come out and make a sequel a decade later after we have cooled down that has got all that and more stuff we didn t even know we wanted and blizzard puts in all the things people claimed would ruin the game that some of us had been asking for but which the main herd of the community couldn t handle but the community figures out no wait we do actually love that but hey it could still use just a small bit more polish getting us all in a frenzy again because we are all are used to perfection from blizzard
It s always been like this man The circlejerk is forever switching
If you only jerk in one direction it s called a stroke
Stop looking for some kind of consistent opinion consensus in an online community made up of thousands of random individuals Differing and often contradictory opinions are going to upvoted by the people who support them
What you have to realize is that there s 176 000 people subscribed to this subreddit That s a lot of different opinions to be had It s not one collective mind that changes every week You have crybabies on this sub that will upvote anything negative and people like me who almost never downvote things unless they really add nothing to the conversation which can skew that ratio
I ve had the opinion that they don t know how to make competitive map pools for a long long time
I really like your points on alot of topics but honestly the only one map pool i can remember being objectively bad was at the end of HoTS And it was due to map winners of the map making contest Everyone was happy that mapmakers get the spotlight but than hated on maps Blizzard devs made much more well rounded and balanced stuff overall
I d rather have map makers do a pool than blizzard to be honest however At least we wouldn t have weird maps that promote supposably creative play which in practice promote for example on prion allins and cheese Good maps should keep at least the first 3 bases standard and move the interesting stuff into the mid late game thats where I think creative map design can shine in competitive play just look at great maps like King Sejong for examples of that
They did a few times most recently the TL map contest that also was met with a ton of hate
Yeah I think people misunderstand why the hate happened it happened because the maps were voted on and Blizzard chose some maps that did not win and the community liked the ones they voted for a lot
deleted
Why even have the vote then Why does the DevTeam think they know so much about what maps should be on ladder
Well if the Dream Pool and the TL map contest are any signs neither do the community
Dreampool was Blizzard s idea what
Yeah the dream pool was the biggest flop in the history of map pools and it was not Blizzard s fault Fuck all y all D
I guess I was a little hard on him Sorry David we do appreciate these posts a lot It comes from a good place I really think some tweaks some skin packs some new ladder changes and that anti hack could potentially do amazing things for sc just want it as soon as possible lol
They made their timelines clear from the very beginning when they announced it on Blizzcon I wish people would ve paid more attention to that
That s the biggest thing to me people are acting surprised Blizzard stuck to their timeline Why is it surprising we ve known the timeline for months it s nothing new
Do you have any source on that timeline I never remember hearing about any such thing
Which Blizzcon are we talking about
last one
patience is a virtue young grasshoppa
HEY BLIZZARD I just want to say that i absolutely love this game and everything you do with it Except maybe the maps not being as standard as i am used to but that can get learned And continue to do amazing Things with this and other games
Just gonna come out and say it Dayvie you re the man Thank you for having the maturity to see above the unproductive comments and continuing to lead the game in a great direction I want you to be my boss one day Soon if possible
Totally agree with keeping things constructive If we want the game to be better let s keep a calm focus and state specifics and evidence Emotional ranting isn t going to help anything I have always appreciated Blizzard s attention to detail and polish The one thing that has always separated Blizzard from many others is that they don t rush anything out When it gets released you are getting a piece of artwork that probably had countless iterations behind the scenes before it brought about even small changes That s no different with what I imagine is the designing and balancing process of SC2 multiplayer The reason I as I assume many others spend so much time with this game is that I trust Blizzard will eventually get it right They won t give up until they re satisfied and they haven t let me down in retrospect The open communication is something I can t thank this dev team for enough It s just something you rarely see in most games You might get an explanation of the finished patch but to get an insight in between patches doesn t just make me want to give better feedback it makes me want to play more to see what s worth another look I ve been going through the progression of maps during the history of SC2 and it s impressive to see how many various unique factors have already been presented There were a lot of standard maps but plenty that did have some interesting designs that never got their full time in the spotlight It d be nice to see some mapmakers go back and see what used to make maps so much fun to play on and bring some of those ideas back into this new age of maps When I look at maps like King Sejong Station Frost or Overgrowth they were all pretty standard but took ages to grow old They had many amazing games and usually felt fresh compared to other standard maps mostly due to the creative layouts The standard maps we see nowadays don t take long to feel a little lacking compared to the titans we ve had previously However I m impressed with the new original maps that present a specific feature to differentiate them They feel like they belong but I wouldn t mind keeping an eye on what isn t working and maybe make changes mid season if necessary Also don t be afraid to get even crazier in aspects that work Going forth I hope to see the ladder continue to consist of half solid fun standard maps with a unique design and half completely original maps like the ones we see now The balance between experimentation and refinement is what playing SC2 is all about and that should carry over into ladder maps as well As long as each map is balanced enough so that no matchup feels like it has to be vetoed we can find a healthy spectrum between standard and original maps that don t sacrifice solid timeless design
has blizzard ever admitted they were wrong the pros do not like the maps the streamers do not like maps What was unique about maps like whirlwind or frost There weren t anything that stuck out out of those two and they were great and fun to play on
uhhh 1 which maps and 2 which pros
from what I have seen prion central protocol and ulrena are widely considered to be bad maps I haven t heard anyone talk about close spawns on ruins of seras but i would love to hear an argument for how it is good
So because maps are not uniform they re considered bad I ve heard complaints about protocol but that s pretty much it And blizzard addressed protocol saying they re going to polish it up
not sure what you mean by not uniform but playing new maps every season is part of what makes the game fun and the current maps are just not very fun prion is one of the most widely complained about maps because zvz is a total shitshow on it and the gold bases are incredibly strong for zerg in other matchups there are maps that promote different gameplay that are fun and maps that promote different gameplay that are not so fun a map that tries to promote different gameplay by making the 3rd 4th both gold bases is a pretty lazy way of doing so edit I will admit I had fun on prion the first month or so it was out but its stale now
Okay so what are zerg s doing thathe is just insane on that map I ve been playing on it and I love it I m a macro player and it s really really easy to play macro games on it in zvz If that is what you re looking for I can tell you what I do and my thought process through it It all comes down to scouting for a second overlord Even if the opponent does a pool first speed build into a gold the defending hatch first player will be way ahead
I liked the maps Ulrena was heavily criticized early on but people made it work Central protocol have some weird cheese for zerg But I don t know a lot I vetoed since the beginning of the season Prion is cool because it zerg can both become huge or you can easily attack from 2 fronts I know it is zerg favored but not impossible as some people make it
People complain about the maps because Blizzard s internal team has shown an inability to create good maps Not just this year but across the entirety of Starcraft 2 The best maps have all come from community mapmakers yet every once in a while Blizzard forgets that they suck at that particular aspect of their job and decides that quirky is better than good The few moderate successes they have had were when they got out of their own way and put out basic macro maps Antiga Shipyard Entombed Valley Shakuras Plateau that followed general guidelines of map design rather than focusing on one gimmick I scoured through a list of all 1v1 ladder maps in SC2 s history and the best Blizzard maps I found were Antiga Shipyard Akilon Wastes Entombed Valley Shakuras Plateau Metalopolis and I guess Vaani Research Station Compare that to Frost Cloud Kingdom Daybreak Whirlwind Bel shir Vestige Overgrowth Ohana Korhal Compound Coda Foxtrot Labs Polar Night Habitation Station King Sejong Station Terraform Yeonsu Echo etc That s not to say that there aren t flops from the community either but the peaks have almost all been from non Blizzard maps edit On top of general map design there s also the fact that Blizzard puts out ugly looking maps Obviously having doodads all over the place doesn t work but some of the stuff Blizzard has put out looks like they got to the first draft and decided to ship it as is
Can t we just have one map like Overgrowth Having unique maps is fine but I want just one nice simple map where you are free to use whatever strategy you want This isn t a black white issue If people want a standard map what s the harm in allowing one Also I find it strange David Kim describes Orbital Shipyard as a very standard map It has a backdoor natural and a very close and easily defended third on a high ground When I think of Standard maps I think of ones like Cloud Kingdom Daybreak Overgrowth Bel Shir Vestige etc
I don t think any single map such as Coda was to blame for the perceived blandness of mid HotS gameplay I think it had more to do with late HotS having Echo Coda and Expedition Lost being played at the same time All of which fit into the very standard 2 player map layout Three seems like too many for sure but I still think zero is too few
I m not talking about the season 2 2015 but about season 3 when Terraform Moonlight Madness Dash and BridgeHead were added Basically all the series no matter the tournament had Coda or Cactus Valley in them and the same strategies were used that s what generates the issues David Kim is talking about that s what generates the stagnation he doesn t want I do agree with you that the lack of something resembling a standard layout is more or less necessary but keep in mind that by doing that you are also heavily influencing the metagame development What I and many other mapmakers have suggested is to basically force tournament organizers into using more community maps and shy away from using basically any ladder maps by creating a Pro map pool in the same way iCCup used to do that changes rapidly over time you can keep a very interesting ever changing meta but sadly the WCS season get in the way and this is without even mentioning the incredibly strong lobbying pro players do to avoid any kind of non ladder map to ever reaching tournaments
The 4 player maps are rather standard maps If you dont think we have standard maps in the map pool I have no hope for you lol
I ll do my best to continue moving forward without your hope I gave you 4 good examples of what I consider very standard maps Ruins of Seras is pretty standard for a big 4 player map but not truly standard overall like those other I listed Lerilak is definitely not standard since it s got a very open natural with two entrances and spawn orientation makes a huge difference with the rotational symmetry Central Protocol doesn t have any single thing horribly wrong with it but overall is probably the most hated map in the current pool Only Horizontal spawns have a decent third base location watchtowers see too much of the map no ramp into main etc Don t get me wrong none of these maps are extremely unique or anything But I still maintain that none of them are very standard except possibly Ruins of Seras but not everyone likes large 4 player maps
Alternate accounts are a serious problem on bnet forums as well Sometimes its just one guy raising a huge stink with his various accounts being as obnoxious as possible Truly regrettable
Prion is fine Lerilak change is great Orbital Shipyard also great Central Protocol Could be cool map if the back rocks into your main ramp had a tighter choke so you could defend it with less The tile set on Central is a little confusing around the middle of the map
Blizzard your games are AWESOME and LotV is the best game I ve ever had the pleasure of playing It pains me to read that your team might feel discouraged because of a few loud negative voices Thank you for an amazing rts GG
Hey blizz the reason many of us were salty about the no map change is because we have played three of these since the beginning of beta they are almost a year old one of the more popular suggestions is to replace some of these with the new GSL maps Rakshir and Skyshield
As a Starcraft 2 fan right from the beginning I really appreciate how Blizzard is communicating during LotV beta and now after release I was really looking Forward for a fast ladder revamp but to be honest I think waiting for a high quality implementation is worth it I really appreciate that Blizz is giving insights early into new ideas so the community can discuss I really feel sorry for DK and his Team getting so much flak they don t deserve it Thank you Blizz and Keep up the good work
i think the most important part about maps is to have more than 2 spawning locations so that not every game turns into proxy cancer since the opponent knows where you are without doing anything tal darim all day please
My exact comment on the community update of this week Feels good and bad to be right YEA So when Blizzard communicates about the changes and when it s happening You guys all cry like babies See why companies don t like to communicate about their internal work If you want more transparancy STOP crying when a new feature doesn t come out tomorow It won t changes a SINGLE thing Blizzard works hard for us and Sc2 Thank you
try looking at dustin browders tweeter hes openly trying to communicate every day for heroes watch what he has to deal with yeesh
What is the point of community feedback and two way communication if blizzard reads what we re saying and then does what they were going to do anyway
What s wrong with sticking to your guns for a few things that you know the community is wrong about
the fact that the community is not wrong and the map pool is horrible every pro gm says that
I m not debating about specific changes I m just answering your question
How could the community be wrong about what they want I ve always felt like Blizzard feel they know what we enjoy more than we do and given the drastic and frankly quite epic decline in almost every single one of their games shows that they really need to drop this attitude
Because they clearly want to balance the game regardless of the map pool and now is the perfect time to try to do it If they succeed it s going to be better in the long run If they fail there are always going to be standard maps The community does not know everything Remember the dreampool remember the TLMC maps that everyone lauded yet ultimately hated
Some ideas for map make the maps beautiful and aesthetically pleasing to look at i think that s almost more important in some ways You want to just see the loading screen and enjoy the map feel fun to run around on too
But you have to keep in mind that the maps have to be able to run efficiently on all PC s even the ones with the minimum specs This means having as fewer doodads as possible and avoiding things such as water It s kind of hard to accomplish both usually when a community map is picked Blizzard spends a while just clearing out as many doodads as possible
It would be cool if they added a feature in the map editor where you could have different layers of decoration that will only show up depending on the settings the player is playing on I don t think it would be terribly hard to implement and would make it so that you could still have the bustling gorgeous doodad heavy maps for spectating WCS or other major tourneys but it would work for low settings that many people normally play on for performance
Yep I think Nate said something similar recently about how Blizzard generally has to remove doodads to make the maps run more evenly
I was wondering recently if there was a way for Blizzard to tier out maps So like the same map pool but map makers would submit multiple versions of maps high end mid tier low end Blizzard has every player s computer specs based on the graphics settings they use in game so they can just let the people who have nice computers enjoy a beautiful map and then dumbify it for people with microwaves
from what I ve gathered during my time of mapping is that the complaints often aren t from low end PC s but mostly mid to high PC users that start crying the moment fps drops to 59 and aren t willing to lower settings but yeah making sure low end PC s can play too is also a concern
yeah take full advantage of the combined tile set or what was it
Pinion Terraces needs one gold no more to be interesting IMO To create exciting games I d like to see the raised mid map blue mineral bases become golds The two current mid golds in the map don t see much use outside of late game scenarios and could also maybe stay but all this would encourage is expanding to those spots instead of the current gold bases Might see some wacky tactics that way though Risk is a factor because they re easily sieged from the low ground Scouting this spot could decide games if the player expands here very early on Defense might be easier from the ramp side for protoss to also create a safer gold expansion rush should they choose to do so The biggest downside here in changing this map to just blue minerals map wide is it loses all its excitement and kinda becomes drab With this suggested change I think we could see a pretty strong spiritual successor to maps like Habitation Station which created some pretty interesting games in my opinion and all races benefited marginally the same But maybe I m just crazy
Blizzard will never admit that they were wrong rofl It s not the first time they tried to spin it and pin the whole thing on ungrateful and demotivating community
exactly Also its not like LOTV is a new game Its the same game as Blizz released Wings 6 years ago Just has 6 new units like seriously wtf do these people do all day besides feel sorry for themselves
Well besides units they DID fix quite a bit of stuff in LoTV though it took them 6 years which is just bad no matter how you slice it So i kind of agree i guess
Anyone else don t think the map is as bad as people say they are except for Ulrena because fuck that shit
Much of the negative reaction arises from how some critical information in the post was handled Dropping the line we hope to launch the revamped ladder in the second half of the year right in the midst of an otherwise run of the mill community update was extremely ill advised and gave the strong impression that the expectations and priorities of the team are misaligned with those of the community How you guys thought that it wouldn t elicit disappointment and frustration I don t understand A separate post or YT vid similar to what Ben Brode s been doing for Hearthstone that explains the challenges the objectives and the timeframe would not have attracted the same kind of vitriol Not being mean but the controversy is 100 on you guys and the passive aggressive tone in this follow up does nothing for anybody The decision not to update the map pool is still highly questionable even after the detail we ve been offered here Freshening up the ladder every few months should be a basic function of SC2 s management and the developer oriented rationale that balance is easier when the pool is static is frankly not acceptable The customers come first that doesn t mean that you ought to take a scalpel to Prion Terraces based on mob opinion but you can t justify inaction or a controversial decision based on what the developers are comfortable with you have to base that decision on the consumer experience and in this case refusing to cycle in new maps has absolutely no upside for us
Agreed entirely new maps would keep the ladder refreshing Were on the first season of 2016 not years down the line in lotv and yet were forced to play the same somewhat uninteresting maps We dont need radically differentmaps either
This just shows that the community needs to be more positive Standard psychology here Positivity encourages people to work harder Negativity results in lackluster results and poor quality products
I love this new community update you guys are awesome thanks for your criticism I can t understand why you need several months to finally address the leave league bug or need another 6 months to revamp the ladder it makes it look like there are only a few people working on SC2 Wow asshole fuck off we need constructive criticism your negativity is demotivating
In practice removing the gold bases is bad What practice Where have pros played on this map with normal expansions Honestly you could just make one of the golds a normal expansion It s the double gold that s retarded vs zerg The map doesn t have unique strategies you either cheese as terran or protoss vs zerg or you lose
He s saying that their current principle is to have a diverse map pool The only real distinctive factor for that map is really the gold bases removing that makes it a standard map In practice removing the gold bases is bad because they re leaving their principle re map pool
Remove 1 gold and its the only map in the pool with a gold third Still unique and much better to play on
As far as winrate goes I like the map for obvious reasons but If that s all it has going for it then quite frankly it s not that much of a loss
I m actually in favor of the idea of unique different maps that push towards unique strategies The crux is all in what differences we re really going for Mineral heavy armies don t really appeal to me especially when you factor in that the map inherently favors zerg which means zergling heavy compositions Really close rush distances don t really appeal to me ulrena I think that is why they are seeing negative feedback about keeping this map pool That is my problem with the map pool It isn t that the maps are different it is that they are different in a way that isn t fun or appealing Maybe ask the community for ideas on how maps should be different I don t mean specific elements but maybe maps that favor air play Or maps that a really easy third is available for all three races I m not saying it has to be these things specifically I m just giving examples but let s find some unique ideas the community might enjoy
Don t flatter yourselves guys I doubt he s talking about this subs comments because they re toothless compared to ones made by people on the bnet forums Holy shit I went there to get away from the toxicity often present in this sub and that place is way way worse Out of the frying pan into the fire for real
I like map diversity I don t want the same builds on each map If you are rude in your comments you don t deserve to get listened too even if you have a good idea
I take issue with DKim blaming us for his team being demotivated We re the customers who ve purchased this product it is us who this game is for The playerbase is a fraction of what it used to be its because people have become demotivated to buy play this game Is that our fault The onus is on DKim his team to put out a good product that we consumers will buy support The aspersions from the community are directly related to the millions of posts conversations we ve had while seeing little change as a result What does DKim expect That we re all just gonna tell them hey guys good job If his team is that demotivated then perhaps they need to fire the person leading their team put someone in who will motivate them to do their jobs We all understand that it takes time to get things right but at his timeframe at 4 6 9 months from launch how many players will even be left They say time is money well i say DKim the clock is ticking but thanks for the update
It s the way people say things They appreciate the constructive feedback but people have been pretty extreme with how they word things Like your post You don t know anything about how they operate or what they are working on and you re saying somebody should be replaced That s not constructive and quite stupid imo
Its people like you that need to just fuck off
I don t
I like the maps
See how much of fucking pricks you are You guys are disrespectful and mean Who are you to talk shit about people like this The dev team and all of the Starcraft 2 have done so much and yet people only whine and make this community worse I just want to say FUCK YOU because that s how I m feeling You guys are toxic and make people feel bad Good job for demotivating people who are very passionate
ok sorry davie i take it all back your team is huge your team is fully devoted to this game and lotv is fully featured and complete but it still takes 7 months from release for ladder rework
sorry we were dicks after the last community update Thanks for everything you do for starcraft And keep up the community updates they re amazing We love you david kim starcraftteam 3
I wish blizzard would stop thinking every map must be unique I get that you want to have some different maps but not every map Imo people should be able to veto all the special maps So 3 maximum and the rest should be standard so that people can choose whether they like to play them or not And please blizzard stop being stubborn and admit that prion with double gold as your natural third has failed and just chance them to blue bases Not every idea has to be a succes
I think this is because they don t want to balance the game through standard maps and want game balance to stand on its own throughout a variety of maps They have said so before iirc They ve been pushing for a variety of maps since HotS where the community also shut them down and asked for standard maps all the time Blizz must see LotV s new meta as an opportunity to test if they can balance the game without overrelying on maps
It s honestly how Brood War was at first Blizzard didn t do shit to balance that game so you had some whacky fucking maps made in an effort to to balance out win rates between races
I agree with what he said at the very end The way the community is acting is demotivating for the SC2 team and Blizzard in general I agree that some things are taking a little bit too much time Skins for example but people don t seem to see how much Blizzard is investing and supporting SC2 I mean look at this year s prize pool you think a DreamHack or ESL will increase the Prize pool that much Afreeca maybe i m sure that all that support from the money to the way they worked on WCS 2016 and the way they are working with us The community for a better game shows how much Blizzard cares about the game So PLEASE stop being demotivating and discouraging and instead give constructive feedback even if you don t agree with SC2 Team don t just bach on the team and give them solutions and suggestions instead
So what if it is demotivating you abide by customers
tldr everyone shut the fuck up Thank god he said it People are insane on this subreddit recently
Good job guys we triggered Blizzard
Blizzard something I think that isn t brought up enough is the fact that you CANNOT hit liberators with spores OR queens on Orbital Shipyard if they position themselves correctly Please please PLEASE fix this by either removing unnecessary airspace or extending the amount of buildable ground behind the mineral lines on that map
Yeah you can You just can t do it if they get the liberators range Which nathanias popuralized doing after stealing the build from bunny
Yes and it s completely retarded here let me stop you from mining from 2 bases without effort GG
How is this bad I can put a Tempest there too and not get hit Zero effort There is a tech investment in doing that
Yeah its pretty strong I think the only real way to beat it is getting mutas out pretty fast but not commiting to it
On one base it does come out by 6 minutes On 2 bases its more like 7 to 7 30 So 1 they re gambling and hoping the opponent will not walk up and straight up kill them And 2 if the libs do no damage because getting a spire out in time is pretty easy the zerg is super far ahead
The talk about working together is pretty cool though in the old days you bought a game and that was it I hope they could tweak the cyclone and there was a lot of good feedback there to work with
I mean Blizzard gave you what you wanted right Now we have welfare championships so that you can cheer on your little favorite guy with the same skin color as you and feel happy about it fuck the top tier let them stay on their island and play amongst themselves After all we don t want top quality games we just want to cheer for someone who makes us think hey that could be me So why are you guys bitching at the team now
map pool is really stale central protocol really just let us use the GSL maps and no one would care that the ladder update is late or whether skins are in the game
Fuck david kim and his sack of bullshit
I like the maps I like that they keep strong units and interesting maps rather than flattening out the game and giving into whiners
The community had NO say in the development of SC and BW they helped the competitive scene stay alive and thrive but you want development power and say look at BW when the community had even less say then Also don t say give us tools over and over and then not say what tools you want
No anger at all just sadness by ignorance Blizzard does most of those things which is sad the community ignores them or hates them in the case of the last TL map contest which had some great cash prizes
I m not at all ignoring the map making community I mean honestly my entire point is that we need to work even harder for map making It should be monthly not seasonally And we should be collecting way more maps from the community and including them in the map pool
I don t know why he tried to deny the fact that SC2 multiplayer development team is small If it s not small it s absurdly incompetent The new ladder for example first they said it was coming with LotV then in early 2016 now it s second half of the year I doubt there are more than 10 people going to work every day to try and make SC2 a better game Not buying this have pity on us we are doing our best talk
Can you provide a link where they said it s coming with LotV
