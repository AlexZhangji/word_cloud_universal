You know this shit is serious when you get a BBC breaking news notification on your phone
I thought that as well BBC news not some small time BBC Sport notification
They should ve got the Queen to announce it
This is obviously exciting if you re a City fan but it ll be a shame to see Pellegrini leave the PL He s a top manager
I d love to see him managing Chile
Me too but he publicly declared that s not happening at this time
He said he will but not for a few years yet
Even if Pelligrini wins the treble he will still be replaced I can t imagine how he must be feeling about this whole situation
Won t be the first time Pep replaces a treble winning manager
More like it won t be the second time
I think he s probably fine with it He signed on for three years and stated at the time he prefers three year projects A few weeks ago he even said he hopes Pep manages City one day He also seems to have chose to announce this now of his own accord so presumably he d rather just get on with the season without having to deal with the rumours
Probably because he s a professional It helps nobody if he throws his toys out before the season is over He isn t going to get them to break the contract so he might as well accept it and set himself up for a new role as well as possible
Maybe he s cutting some of his expenses because he knows hes Honda way out
That s a man with true Integra ty
He knows fiscal responsibility is part of his Civic duty
They must think Pep s a better Fit
He already knew before he signed a contract with City that he would be coming in for 3 years He is on good terms with both the management and Pep and I m sure he will be happy for the club What a charming man he is Us City fans will all miss him
He has also said in the past before City that he believes in 3 year projects at football clubs
I wouldn t mind him at Chelsea but he seems pretty similar to Guus Hiddink
Who has been fine
tbf you ve been doing much better under Hiddink than Mou
I don t know why they don t give Guus a 1 2 year deal and see what he can do We re a whole lot better football team under him right now
Ask Heynckes
He said in an interview a month or two ago that if he were to lose his job that he d prefer to stay in the PL
May be a job down the M62 if Martinez doesn t sort our fucking defence out I d be happy to see him pop up at Goodison
He d certainly improve you but defensive stability is far from one of the qualities he brings which is a bit odd as he himself was a centerback
He lacks defensive stability but our defensive record is good It s a mad system which has scary moments every game but it does work And I think Yaya was the downfall of his defence here when compared to the same system he used so successfully at Villareal and Malaga
He can go to Chelsea
Isn t it going to be proper awkward if Bayern and City draw each other in the CL
Champions League final Bayern vs Man City City have dropped to 7th in the League and have no Champions League football next season unless they win the Champions League itself
That could correspond to such a weird version of match fixing
I ve heard he wants to try a new tactic playing Lahm as goalkeeper and Lewandowski as left back
And Neuer as CM No CL for City it seems
I thought Neuer was CM
Nah he s a libero by trade Alas that position is outdated so he plays in goal
He s more of a false 1
The False One
People keep saying this and even used it as a reason why Pep won t announce it until the end of the season but I don t get it Why should it be awkward Until 30th June Pep and Pellegrini work for Bayern and City respectively and they will both do their jobs which is try to win the match Simple as that The result is irrelevant in this context
Yeah I don t know why people think that grown experienced men can t be professionals What do they think that Pep is going to throw the match or something
Not only that but the players would have to cooperate as well it just wouldn t happen
Exactly Its probably even in Pep s interest to knock City out so that he has the chance to be the first City coach to lift the European trophy
Probably do a Gotze and play it off as injured in the stands
I remember a similar situation in the Belgian league Basically Charleroi had to win their last few games to be in Europe at the expense of Bruges Problem was their coach at the time Mathijssen was going to Bruges at the end of the season so they sacked him This would be a better scenario though
It s now or never to win that title Arsene
Arsene s gone toe to toe with Sir Alex for many years he ll be fine edit word
Worst kept secret in football finally out Seriously is there anyone that didn t think this was already the case
A surprisingly high number of optimists on r reddevils actually
Gutted he s not joining his former Barca colleagues here tbh
Don t worry you ll get Enrique once he s done here
Can he bring Neymar with him We ll give you Odemwingie for your troubles
Odemwingie is sitting outside the Nou Camp in his Land Rover waiting
Seems fair
Why not in like 10 11 years
No way Speedy Pete will be a Ballon D or winner by then
denial isn t only a river in Egypt
Not that you can blame them at all for sailing on it though Pep was a free agent on the scale of a top class player
In my opinion United fans have every right to be incredibly disappointed by this He s talked highly of United in the past SAF has had a lot of nice things to say about him and I honestly think if he had been given an identical contract between the two he would have chosen United Missed opportunity but good appointment for City
And the quality of City s squad compared to ours possibly
And their academy In fact that whole complex at the Etihad grounds is pretty impressive Damn it
It was definitely because of their online presence Seriously though the United website is stuck in the 90s
You have to wonder what the United board were thinking if they didn t offer Pep anything Who s available for them to pick up that could give them a hope of competing with City with Guardiola at the helm Mourinho s one but that hasn t happened yet so one suspects it may not happen at all Who else Ancelotti s at Bayern Klopp s at Liverpool Hiddink at Chelsea Pardew at Palace Simeone perhaps
Doesn t City get a little respect for putting out this release though A lot of sport organizations wouldn t bother
My mate bet me 20 Pep was going to Man Utd He likes to give me money
I even argue with many people in my sub who thinks that we might get him
And some masochists at r LiverpoolFC
There s a fine line between optimism and delusion in the face of overwhelming evidence
Imagine they ll shed some tears now then with the realisation that LVG may be sticking around
How unfair would it be if he manages to win the treble just to get replaced
Winning a treble and then replaced by pep That would never happen
You have to win the quadruple to be replaced by Pep
Only that it was Heynckes decision to not sign a new contract in time By the time he thought he would like to continue it was less than half a year before his contract ended No sane club would hope on an almost 70 year old to decide to continue his job and pass up on Guardiola Heynckes has a knack for winning the CL and not having a job by summer though I give you that
The quadruple is still on
The absolute best way to end his legacy He would go down as one of the club s greatest ever managers He d love it
Well we didn t know for sure until we got Riga in
True but this has still stolen all the thunder and headlines from every other club on deadline day
Honestly I have my reservations Pep is an amazing manager no doubt about it and we do have a world class squad The fact we are going to have to pay him alot should work out as Im guessing we have more buying leverage with players wanting to work with Pep Combined with the lack of winter break we will see I think he will be successful but I dont think its going to be as simple as suggested in this thread That said KDB Sterling and Silva working with Pep is dreamy Im guessing Yaya is off too Also Thanks for everything Pellegrini An absolute true gentleman Hope he gets a lovely new job somewhere
The fact that this was still supposed to be a secret was actually a better kept secret
I hate everything
Mourinho is still available
Better wait for someone to take him
Porto
Don t toy with my feelings
He s been angling for the job since Fergie s last season He clearly wants us the fans clearly want him the board s doing its best to suck all joy out of our lives
His tactics are almost as boring as LVG I m not sure why ManU fans want to bring him in so badly
Because they work
But would you prefer having a tactical genius that loses games or one that wins them
Jesus Christ enough with this bullshit already Mourinho produced probably the most exciting counterattacking team in the past 20 years with Real Madrid where they scored a record number of goals in La Liga Not every single one of his teams is defensive Heck his Chelsea team were offensively very strong as well Neither you nor I know how he will set up a Man Utd eleven so let s not pretend like we do
We ll take pellegrini
Hope Pellegrini stays in the UK Really like the bloke
Pellegrini to Wycombe confirmed all thanks to this guy
Mate we had a 46 year old in goal at the weekend but even so Pellegrini would be a supersub at best
Clean sheet too
I have a sneaky he s bound for Valencia
Would be fantastic but I have a feeling we re too fucked up for a manager of his calibre right now I m thinking Rafa if he feels like it
Can Mourinho sign with United now That would be epic
What s the rush I think everybody s happy with lvg
Especially all the rest of you guys in the PL
Majority rules
Give him a contract renewal
Hope he becomes their new Ferguson I terms of longevity not success or cunt ness
So Wenger Cheers for the gold More silverware than Wenger already
Well played
Give him one of those five year contracts that Mignolet got
Shit am I the last person left standing up for him

If it hasn t happened already I don t think it will happen
Why United could be waiting for the end of the season Mourinho preparing the next mercato while sipping some Port wine
I m getting that sinking feeling that it won t even though he should have been the man to take over the moment SAF quit
The real hero of this story seems to be Pellegrini The guy s being replaced but he appears to be the consummate professional Contrast that with Tactics Tim at Spurs Spent half of his final couple press conferences talking about his win percentage And Tim deserved to be replaced whereas Pellegrini doesn t really It s just that you can t pass up Guardiola when he comes knocking Manuel just seems to be a great guy This is the point where someone links to a newstory about Manuel P beating the shit out of a three year old Emma Watson
I m glad to see that it seems pretty amicable between the Club and Manuel He s been a great manager and the fans will remember him very fondly
Not always being a cunt has its ups
Manuel may have his tactics related issues but he is a true gentleman I hope he comes to the Bundesliga although I don t think he will But still it would be amazing and they would live him Maybe Wolfsburg if they decide to go for a foreign trainer or whatever he went to Malaga after Madrid after all I would love to have the guy on the sidelines here
Mourinho to Utd now would be fucking epic
I hope it happens the hype would be unbelievable the type of thing that might bring the club alive again but I ll tell you something he went down in my estimations when he went to city United have not resorted to that You can tell him now we re going to be fighting for the title and he s got to go to stoke on a cold wet Wednesday night and get something And I ll tell you honestly I will love it if we beat them Love it
that sounds like the equivalent of your girlfriend starting a relationship with someone and announcing it on facebook in order to remove the unnecessary burden of speculation
Welp That s it lads Skilled team Pep at the helm All confirmed now Please excuse me while I hide in the toilet until I m brave enough to face the world again Ah yes it s been a long time coming dear loo
Shit I need to find another toilet and quick
Buy yourself a toilet buy your mom a toilet
Filthy whore You re somebody s father you filthy whore
Manchester to still dominate the league for the next X amount of years expect its the other side of Manchester now great
Maybe this is the point where we realise Guardiola is actually a terrible manager and he has just been carried by Messi and the lack of competition in Germany Right guys right
That would be hilarious
This is where City make a marquee signing for Pep from Barca and we don t get to see that theory tested yet cries at the thought
I want us to fight tooth and nail for it Honestly everyone being strong could just be a good thing for us We very obviously need to up our game next season what with Klopp customising his team ian the summer Pep settling at City and with Chelsea making a comeback with Arsenal Tottenham and possibly Leicester all looking for blood It s about time we started getting out of this rut
Could be worse
Klopp at Liverpool Guardiola at City Wenger at Arsenal possibly Simeone at Chelsea Poch at Spurs and LvG at United This should be fun
He means Giggsy in charge with Gary coaching defence Solskjaer coaching strikers Beckham coaching crossing drills and Phil Neville coaching stepovers Rio DJ ing training sessions while Scholes shows up twice a week to kick balls at trees 60 yards away because his missus thinks he needs to get out of the house In all seriousness we need to sign Mourinho straight away I want to see this at the Etihad I want to see Mourinho do this and drive Pep out of the country on stress leave again
the build up to a Mou vs Pep Utd City derby would be absolutely ridiculous
Oh god It d start the Saturday before and the entire week would just be Mourinho sniping at Pep
It would be so fun though Not just a circus an actual gladitorial triumph on the level of the Roman Emperors They could flood Old Trafford afterwards and have sea battles on the pitch and it would only add to the drama
Pardew at Crystal Palace
Pardew vs Guardew is gonna be sick as tits
Not going to lie the idea of us nicking a win against Guardiola and Pardew going FACKIN LEAVE IT AAT YOU CATALAN TWAT makes me moist
pretty certain Pardew would strip half naked and be carried on a shield by Bolasie Zaha and Puncheon like that Gaul leader in Asterix
The lower half mind you
That s a great picture I think I love Pardew
I DAAN CAYAH IF YOU MANAGED FACKIN BAYERN TUNIC YA DICK
And possibly Jose to Utd If that all happens this league will look like Game of Thrones
Let s not talk about that possibility
Don t forget Garde at Villa
Ayoooo
Conte to Chelsea was the last rumour I heard
It would be fun to see Mourinho in ManUtd too
He s been the only man fit and perfect to take over from SAF Most of us had earmarked him as Fergie s successor years before SAF retired Our board would be stupid not to move mountains to sign him up right now
Chelsea are getting Conte apparently
Last thing I ve heard was Conte at Chelsea never heard of Simeone going there
MRW
Think this is a win win situation for City They re getting arguably the best club manager in the world next season and I m sure the players will want to rally together with the fans to give Pellegrini a good send off
Always one for the tough jobs
Waiting for Pep to come out in his first press conference and say I m going to knock Manchester United right off their fucking perch And you can print that That would put Mourinho s I m the Special one press conference in the shade
This might have worked if ManU hadn t already done it to themselves
Van Gaal in his last press conference I knocked Manchester United right off their fucking perch And you can print that
pls no
Time to change that flair bud Sorry but a promise is a promise
Hope you re happy
So much for Pep not saying his next move until the season end
Well he wanted to be respectful to Bayern and that s fair It was City that announced it We felt all the speculation was unfair on Pellegrini who I m sure just wants to get on with his job Whether that s right or wrong I don t know but that s what our higher management had thought
IIRC Pep has previously said that he hasn t signed anything and would announce it if he did
His wording was he hadn t signed anything and IMO that was very calculated wording The Premier league rules mean that if he had signed something the club would have had to inform the PL within 7 days That news would definitely have been leaked So it s likely this was sewn up when Kicker reported it and he simply hadn t signed anything because that would mean it getting out within a week
He didn t Nothing wrong with his new club announcing it imo
Pep City bitch Pep Pep City bitch
Part of me hopes he will be a total flop Can you imagine the reaction of the English press
Told ya he couldn t win on a wet windy night at Stoke
This sub would go mental
More interested to see how United and Chelsea respond to this
We are irrelevant in this situation We have a stadium to build and 5 7 spineless attacking midfielders to recruit alongside pointless signings of centre backs for 2m
Hey that sounds like us
Exciting times to be a blue
Getting him in before the window slams shut
Confirmed on Skysports now this could make Man City a very scary team
Shows the forward thinking from both Manchester sides City sign Soriano in 2012 to get Pep in 2016 United sign Woodward to get a new noodle sponsorship and sell di Maria
Its happening
Let the Messi to City rumors begin again
C mon United sign Mourinho and have a right good game of good vs evil
Messi has now 1 05 chance of going to city
6 weeks too late Good luck maestro And I hate to say this but this is a quirky slap in the face of British media who turned the world round trying to link him with every club bar City while the whole continental media confirmed it last fall Congrats to City even if he ll make your blood boil sometimes you re getting an amazing manager and you will be entertained and fascinated
Anyone else think this will cause Woodward to choke and bring in mou after all
Arsenal better take their chance to win the title this season as its about to get harder
Ahhh Pellegrini we want you so bad
Imagine the Manchester derby next year Pep vs Mourinho Oh sweet Lord please make this happen
Pep takes on Barca Spain wins the world cup Pep takes on Bayern Germany wins the world cup Pep takes on city England wins the world cup LOL JK
We are so close to a super manager face off Klopp Pep Mou and Simone Make it happen Man U and Chelsea
We had it in 2005 Wenger Ferguson Benitez and Mourinho were 4 of the best managers in the world at that time
You can t really include Klopp and Simeone without mentioning Wenger
For the love of god Woodward just hire Mourinho please
Simeone to Chelsea Please prays
Go home everyone Premier League s over
Adding Pep and Klopp in a 12 month span will help to massively improve the tactics in England The tactical game in England has been lacking for a few years which I think has contributed to a lack of success in Europe despite having more money better players and often better facilities at their disposal As a mostly neutral fan from an English perspective it d be really nice to see someone like Sarri or with experience playing and or coaching in Italy join an English club to add to the mix
is that legit edit its legit edit Glad he isnt going United
Yes confirmed on SSNHQ

In his two big jobs he s been replaced by Mourinho and Guardiola that s pretty unlucky
The Andy Murray of football management
Giving too much credit to Murray
Not by much Murray has consistently been the 4th best player in the world with Federer Nadal and Djokovic swirling around him in their ascendancies and declines He gets disregarded because he hasn t dominated any time periods but he s a bloody good player
Not only that but if he d lived during almost any other time period then he probably would have won so fucking much Before Federer hit the scene fucking Hewitt and Roddick were considered the best players in the world Murray is so unlucky Calling Murray a failure is like calling Man Utd a failure for losing two CL finals to arguably the best team ever
The same can be said about footballers in the presence of Messi and Ronaldo Many players like Suarez and Aguero have to live in their mighty shadows
The analogy doesn t work though because Suarez is winning everything now that he s playing alongside Messi Football is a team sport and nobody really cares about the individual awards at least in the UK A better analogy would be Atletico in La Liga In any other era they d be considered one of the top top teams in the world because of their incredible organisation and teamwork elevating the team to greater than the sum of their parts and winning multiple league titles but they re not going to win trebles in the current era because RM and Barca outspend them by 5 1 and build incredibly stacked squads
They haven t won multiple league titles just yet
Higuain while in RM was always the best example of this for me Everyone was calling him shit all the time because he would underperformed when compared to his teamates but his direct competition at RM was CR and in Argentina he played directly in front of Messi Can t really compete with that Now that he s moved he s doing much better and people no longer consider him an utter failure maybe it was just my friends
What happened to Andy Roddick I remember he was a great player a few years back but haven t heard much about him since
He was briefly world number one around the early 2000s but wasn t actually that great A young Federer emerged and almost completely dominated for a few years without much competition before other great players like Nadal also turned up Roddick remained around no 20 in the world Current top ten players like Murray Nishikori and Wawrinka are far better than Roddick ever was There was a period of maybe 7 10 years where men s tennis was kinda shit and Roddick emerged times the end of this period It s also why Sampras isn t usually considered to be on the same level as players like McEnroe and Bjorn despite having won a lot more Sampras dominated during a weak period
He retired pretty young a couple of years back He had his moments of greatness but was never really a top player once the current top 4 hit their stride 2009 Wimbledon aside
I d retire ASAP too if I were married to Brooklyn Decker
So he s Arsenal
Sure but he s such a baby bitch anyway
Ah it s not though I think it s kind to Pellegrini if anything Murray s been one of the top 5 tennis players in the world over the last decade Federer Nadal and Djokovic have all been better than him but it still doesn t diminish his still considerable achievements Pellegrini hasn t been one of the top 5 managers in world football over the last decade He s a good manager but not a great manager in my opinion
Is Nadal still considered better than Murray I don t follow much the scene but I know that Nadal had some injuries and he s not in the same form but I may be wrong
Murray is definitely better right now He lost in the Australian Open final while Nadal lost in the first round
Murray is better today but Nadal s peak is still considered to have been far higher than Murray s peak Nadal was once the best player in the world arguably Murray has never been that
Nadal certainly was better than Murray during the late 2000s and early 2010s and will retire with a better legacy Arguably though by the time Murray hit his peak Nadal was only really the same force on Clay where Murray has been weakest Nadal s been better but not quite as explicitly in Murray s way If you can pick one player on a court of your choosing at their prime to play a tennis match for humanity though it d be prime Nadal on clay
2008 Rafa on clay was insane Didn t lose a single set the entire tournament and beat Federer 6 1 6 3 6 0 He even apologized to Federer for kicking his ass too hard
Being next in line behind the three greatest players of his era is still a fucking unbelievable achievement
In a generation without Federer Nadal and Djokovic we d probably see a Murray with 20 30 Grand Slam wins Murrary is a very good tennis player but he played during an era of all time giants
There s no way he d be winning 20 30 maybe 10 15 I think you re diminishing the other players that also clearly have the potential to be grand slam winners For example look at the 2014 men s final Cilic and Nishikori Wawrinka has been on the rise since 2013 Berdych has been a mainstay in the top 8 or so for many years and can definitely beat Murray when on his game Same could be said for David Ferrer I agree that Andy Murray is definitely the next best player compared to Djoker Rafa and Fed Wawrinka is getting closer but he is getting older so I don t think he will be able to supplant him But saying he will win 20 30 grand slams is ridiculous No men s player has even gotten close to 20 Fed holds the record right now at 17 That said I think Murray is a great player and deserves at least 4 slams considering the number of finals he s been in 8
An Arsenal fan defending the perennially fourth place Tennis player
I highly doubt that but yours is a moot point anyway
Who d be winning them then Murray is easily the fourth best player of this era he s the only one who has managed to keep up with three of the best tennis players we ve seen and in no way means he s a bad tennis player I just think he s pretty unlucky to come up against legends Plus Djokovic has his number every game Edit Coming up in an era against one of the biggest legends a sport has ever seen is unfortunate Coming up against THREE is just plain unlucky One thing for sure though nobody can deny this has been one of if not the greatest eras for tennis ever
Seriously Those 3 guys have legit arguments for being the best ever
i used to think he was shit but he is actually a pretty good player also agree with what the guy below said wawrinka monfils tsonga ferrer and others i cant think of right now could ve won here and there over murray if nadal djokovic and federer werent born
Well I mean just consider what happened yesterday Murray has made it to the Australian final what five six times And he s lost every single one That s pretty telling
It tells you he s consistently one of the best players at the Australian Open
It tells you he s consistently the 2nd best player at the Australian Open really
Pretty much always behind the same guy
Yeah 3 to Djokovic and 1 to Federer in the Aussie open He s actually got a decent record against Djokovic in Grand Slam finals overall though 3 to 2 with Murray beating him the 2 times they ve met outside Australia Federer s beat Murray in every final they ve met Just unlucky that his rise coincided with the decline one of the games all time greats and the rise of another great player
That s exactly my point He s been good enough to reach the final so many times
Pretty telling that he can t beat arguably the greatest tennis player in the sport s history Gosh what a scrub
My point was that it s pretty telling that he made it to the final on so many occasions I guess that didn t come through with my English
Ah my bad sorry
It kind of makes sense though those are two of the only managers who are really better than him That said part of me would love to see what he could accomplish with Real if given an actual chance there rather than having to deal with Perez ushering him out the door from day one It ll never happen though
I think you are absolutely right but I think the evidence suggests that Pellegrini is not very good and certainly not a great manager If you have watched City under him he has put out a lot of strange lineups bad tactical systems especially given his personnel that 4 2 2 2 bad non substitutions and so on Often his bad management has been saved by the individual talent City can afford to put on the pitch Pep is a very clear upgrade over Pellegrini City fans should be thrilled
First of all he has a coherent approach and tactical philosophy possession and ball movement that stretches and pulls apart a defense until you can move the ball to a finisher like Aguero and Pellegrini doesn t Pep makes changes that are considered to fit the personnel available at the time and is aggressive about making these appropriate changes and is willing to consider all kinds of tactical approaches across a broad spectrum of formations to get the best from his team that day He also has consistently gotten the best of his great players with his proven record of winning with these big teams Pellegrini has a squad that should win the PL walking away this year and even more importantly if you watch City he almost never gets the most from his talented players but instead sometimes their individual brilliance is so great that it overcomes Pellegrini s vanilla approach and wins City what they have won Look at the way Pellegrini has achieved what he has how many controlled dominant performances and periods of dominance have their been How many times has a star player had to break through just enough times to make things happen
With Pep that was the intentional result of the system and pretty much all his attacking players were stars The system worked as intended and the stars scored within it It might have been boring but it was controlled designed and executed With Pellegrini half the time the stars scored despite the system despite the team looking poor the rest of the time Not to mention Pep took his great rosters and won the CL with them while Pellegrini has under achieved
Yeah like those amazing Champions League wins he s managed with Bayern right Where the plan was choke all the life out of the game and hope Robben can magically become Messi so that I don t have to coach an attack
You just reduced his quality to allowing messi to be the best player in the world and then ruining Bayern by making them the only legitimate contenders for the bundlesliga for three consecutive seasons Does he need to win the CL with Swindon Town to be a commodity I don t remember Pellegrini establishing anything close to dominance at the clubs he has managed
I don t really have a well established opinion on Pellegrini one way or the other but Pep s managerial career consists of being made to look good by Messi and then making Bayern a substantially less formidable opponent than they were before he turned up My doubts aren t so much Pellegrini is amazing as they are I m not at all convinced of Pep s supposed genius
Bayern are the same formidable squad they were before pep they just happened to steamroll the CL in a season where there was a power vacuum where the clubs in a position to challenge them were in crisis As for the reductionist idea that messi made pep s career ask Tata how easy it is to manage a club with the best player in the world
I agree 100 But do you remember when everyone said imagine what David moyes could do with a team with money when he managed Everton
ok we get it you hate Pep calm your tits mate
My vote is for Diego Simeone That s all I m saying What are we talking about
Wenger is a better manager than Pellegrini I like Pellegrini but don t be daft At City he s always had a ridiculous squad and a ridiculous budget He never would have been able to manage a team for almost 20 years most of which were on a budget seeing them through a big stadium change whilst making Top 4 consistently EDIT r soccer is infuriating sometimes Pellegrini better than Wenger Get your fucking heads checked lads
Keeping a side in the top four for a decade or more is hardly the only measurement of a managers quality
I d say you were downvoted cos of the silly unarguable argument that you put forward rather than who s better It s a stupid thing to say that Pellegrini wouldn t have been able to do that because how the fuck do you know he wouldn t have
You tell me why he would have He didn t hang about for too long when shit hit the fan at Malaga
I don t know that he would have and neither do you that s the point
Wenger is a better manager but not for the reasons you listed Pellegrini and Wenger seem to have the same Achilles heel Attacking way too much and being prone on the counter although it seems like Wenger can sit back against better teams see Bayern
Ancelotti Allegri Klopp Simeone Wenger hell even Blanc are arguably way better than Pelegrini
Ancelotti and Simeone sure The rest I d say aren t substantially better than him certainly not by enough that it would make sense to let go of Pellegrini just because one of them was available
Of that list I d only agree with Ancelotti and maybe Simeone The rest are on the same tier as Pellers to me
Completely disagree He s done a decent job with you but that s it What s he got to show A league a league cup and successive seasons of underachievement in Europe That might change this season but it remains to be seen All that and he s had easily the best squad in England for his three years in charge Klopp did a much better job at Dortmund than he s done with you Wenger is definitely the superior manager overall though their performances over the last number of years is close and Blanc is debatable He s a good manager not a great manager Pep is head and shoulders ahead of him and I am fucking scared now ye ll have him next year
Every season we ve been in Europe we ve gotten a tough group Add that to the hectic EPL schedule and I would say he s done OK in his three year term If he gets knocked out by Dynamo Kiev then I would say he s been a flop
Yeah That s why I said he s done a decent job But he s not been better than Klopp who won two leagues a cup and reached a champions league final with very limited means It does not make him as OP said second only to Pep and Mourinho I reiterate good but not a great manager
Going out to Barca is no shame Before city he actually had a decent CL career where he took Villarreal and Malaga to Quarters and Semis
Lol what I take it you ve erased the final season of Klopp s tenure at Dortmund from your mind Do you think Fergie wasn t much of a manger after we d only won a couple of titles with him And embarrassed ourselves thoroughly in Europe the first few times we were allowed back in those competitions Very few clubs can step up to the Champions League and immediately play like they belong there It takes a certain institutional nous that takes time to build up
Lol I got downvoted Klopp won the Bundesliga and got Dortmund to a CL final Pellegrino cant get oil rich city past the quater final Allegri basically turned Serie A into a 1 horse race
Yeah Juventus were really struggling in Serie A before Allegri took over
Bundesliga is a two team league He did well to reach the CL final but he ran his team haggard and never replicated that success
BL was never considered a two team league before Klopp though
Not sure why you re being downvoted you didn t really say anything controversial Are people just ignoring the fact that you said arguably
He has been replaced for the better though He is competent but not great He will never be great and will never achieve the real goals of the top clubs he goes to He will be extremely successful in clubs where there s lower expectations and it s consequently harder to do well I ve watched him in Real and River plate and he has always been slightly cowardly conservative in the matches where everything hangs in the balance derbies usually
Grande el Pelle
Really hope he goes to Everton but I would completely understand if he went to Chelsea
Very unlikely but I d love to have him
I wouldn t be surprised if Everton manages a CL spot with Pellegrini
My dream is for him to actually get a fair chance at the Real job but that will never happen with Perez there
Perez or anyone for that matter Under him we got crushed by a tier 3 league team and Lyon beat us in 1 8 of CL And despite getting a lot of points in the league he failed in the key matches Definitely a coach I would not like to see returning to the club
He also had very little control over the signings he was allowed to make and it s likely the players knew especially towards the end of the season that he wasn t going to be around next year which never helps a manager Also you ve basically alienated every other top manager Mourinho and Ancelotti probably aren t coming back Pep and Simeone would never go there to begin with who s left that s substantially better than Pellegrini Not too many managers honestly
All but Alonso were forwards and according to him he felt the club needed to focus their attention elsewhere Instead they got Rid of Robben who Pellegrini wanted to keep and replaced him with three other forwards As he put it you can t have an orchestra with ten guitarists Especially when one of those guitarists is Kaka
I ve always thought of Pellegrini as one of the best managers we ve had over the past decade or two along with Del Bosque he s pretty much it The loss to Alcorcon was a fluke I was sorry to see him go more so when he was replaced by a coach whose lack of sportsmanship contradicts the very fundamentals of the club He had to deal with the complicated even more complicated when it s Real Madrid ahem Casillas ahem final seasons of several big names and had Guti in particular causing shit constantly as Guti has always been wont to do when not hinting at absolute football genius I was really pleased to see him get the recognition of the City job and then succeed at it and I ve always suspected that any edge Pep might have over him as a coach is really just down to timing and squads I may very well be proven wrong in the near future of course
They brought in Albiol and Arbeloa too and Garay came back from loan and played quite a bit It was nowhere near as unbalanced a squad as people say it was it was balanced enough to get 96 points
I liked him You can only do so much in one season I say give a chance assuming Zidane doesn t cut it
Is that really your dream
Since I was a wee boy
That would make Chelsea to the second team to be managed by Ancelotti Mourinho and Pelegrini all in a five year span
I ve always had the impression that he hates Everton
These numbers are skewed a bit by the modern dominance of the top sides When Arsenal won the league in 98 which would count in Arsene Wengers first 99 PL games they did so with a win of only 58 The league used to be a lot more even back in the day The stat is also a little misleading for Ferguson as it doesn t count his early record in the old First Division when Man U weren t exactly tearing up trees with him at the helm
Yes but to be fair all one of the major talking points about this season has been how odd it is Also the bigger teams tend to do better in the second half of the season as their squad depth becomes more of a factor The title winner this season probably will have a low total but I d put money that whoever comes out on top this season will have a higher win than the 57 Leicester are currently on Of course we might be seeing the beginning of a new trend where clubs incomes are dominated by broadcasting deals which fortunately in my opinion spread the wealth pretty evenly If that s the case we might see a more even and competitive league in the future but I wouldn t bet on it just yet
I think money from TV deals being more evenly distributed across the league will help out the poorer teams much more than the wealthier teams The relative increase in revenue that provides them is huge For this reason I can see the league becoming more and more competitive as the top teams lost their comparative advantage in generating money and being able to attract players with wages and transfer fees
Sounds about right given the squad at his disposal
You could say that about any manager at a top club He has done a good job
No doubt if he can win a trophy or two this year he would ve done a very good job wasn t trying to slate him at all Just meant that this was a stat seemed about right
Well he did in his first season what Mourinho got manager of the season for last season He s already done a very good job
Did Pellegrini win manager of the season when he won the double Or did the media vote for Rodgers I can t recall
Pulis won it
Right Completely forgot
He won fuck all mate Travesty
But he usually doesn t do the job the fans club want
His city side are currently 3 points behind Leicester and only 7 points ahead of United like he s done an ok job but really look at the money he has had available and the squad he inherited he won 1 title Reddit likes him because he s an amicable man so they are currently giving him a free pass Hive mind thinks he s nice and treated badly by the big meanies in charge of RM man city He s done fine but cmon he could have achieved more
Not Chelsea
Manager at top team has win percent only matched by the other top teams More at 11
Nah Mou was at Chelsea
Good one
I really believe he can do wonders in Italy maybe AC Milan can pick him up
I like Pellegrini I think he is suited better to league competitions than cup competitions but he has done a great job with City It will be interesting to see if Pep changes their European results
This is common for attacking managers Cup s reward solid defences leagues reward the 3 points earned by each victory Even if you lose afew games in between you can still lead the table Too many draws in a league on the other hand can kill your chances Probably why LVG did so well in the World Cup with the Netherlands but is now struggling with Utd even though they have one of the best defences in the league
Hope he remains in the PL Class manager
No one is open
Hopefully he lands the Chelsea job
I don t think I could handle all these great managers in the league at the same time
Eplmasterrace
Pep and who
Pards
Don t forget Eddie Howe
Allardici
Doesn t he want to retire and head back to Chile
He said he wants to stay in England
Ah fair enough I always imagined him going home I think I heard his wife and kids all still live there and taking over the national team
Yeah that was my initial thought too but seems he feels he still has more to offer
where did he say that
Same interview or whatever it was in which he said he hopes Pep manages City one day
With how things are in Chile I highly doubt he is eager to go back any time soon
Totally agree With the current situation you d have to be crazy to want to come here edit for a job as Manager of any team I meant the football situation Country s doing fine in general
What s the national team situation Seems like plenty of managers like to go to international management later on due to the slower pace and less hectic schedules or do you think he s still got more to give to a club
Long history short The people that own Chilean Football are all corrupts assholes
The national team you mean or the club teams
The FA mainly
Honestly I think it would be a very bad deal for him to go to our NT The ANFP Chile s National Professional Football Association has a history of driving managers away because of corruption and overall poor resource management see Bielsa s and Sampaoli s resignations
I would not equate Bielsa to Sampaoli Sampaoli was in on it as far as I m concerned Saint Bielsa remains immaculate
I haven t seen that reported yet I know he mentioned that he wouldn t want to be their National manager
Erm no thanks
wenger
58
He had to rebuild couple of times as well as he inherited a team that was 13 and 5th the past two seasons Didn t have the funds available to him for most of the banter years Should be hovering around 60 or so
Yeah his seasons also include the late 90s where win percentage were lower as the sides were more evenly matched What makes Wenger remarkable other then his extremely long tenure and what sets him apart is his his ever evolving entertaining style of play and his ability to rebuild teams with talents while still staying relevant in the table He managed Arsenal over 20 seasons 737 matches W427 D181 L129 58 win and a goal difference of 684 1382 698
Basically a budget Ferguson shame he was up against the actual god Edit Oh no the Arsenal downvote brigade
He also did this with the most expensive side every assembled in Premier League History
He s a good manager but he has had one of if not THE most expensive squads in PL history
I don t think I could handle all these great managers in world football over the last decade
I m quite sad to see him go I like him a lot as a manager and he seems like a stand up guy I hope he gets a good job after this one and can get some more silverware
Great guy and a good coach
So he is third Why adding this drama line higher than anyone EXCEPT
I was sorry to see returning to the second team to be at the helm tearing up trees with him at all
Pellegrini did nothing wrong to be honest
They re 1 2 1 against us in the past 2 seasons That should be reason enough to let him go
Kind of downplaying yourself here arent you
It was a tongue in cheek But to answer yes we are a good side now Before this season not so much
What a signing Payet has been
Almost inexplicable tbh Amazing that other sides weren t interested Hopefully he doesn t get his head turned over the summer
You were pretty good with allardyce too
No not particularly We have hovered around the 43 pt mark for the past 3 seasons flirting with relegation for long stretches That had nothing to do with the manager however It had to do with our club s financial position We have operated from a position of debt consolidation for the past decade Around 9 or 10 years ago we came within minutes of going into administration Two perhaps arguably 3 seasons ago we started rebuilding the squad with long term players We had a good start to last season but from Boxing Day onward we were pretty near the bottom of the form table for the league Anyhow we re a pretty decent side now and I expect us to be a top 6 side next season
Man City are so fucking spoilt it hurts
He reminds me of Columbo I just hope that when he goes to leave he pops back through the door and says to Guardiola just one more thing
if our board is sane then they ll hunt him down and sign him for next season
Absolutely mental that City are going to let him go but here we are
It s not that mental considering who they ve chosen instead
Guardiola took over from a Munich side that won the treble you could argue they ve gone backwards under his management At Barcelona he inherited a lot of once in a lifetime type of players in their prime Puyol Iniesta Xavi not to mention Messi
Are you really trying to say that guardiola has just bluffed it this whole time
Would Ancelotti Pellegrini Wenger have done any worse than Pep inheriting Messi co and then inheriting Jupp s treble winning team Considering Lucho was a distinctly average manager who rocked up at Barca and won a treble
Those managers probably wouldn t do any worse but the sqaud he inherited shouldn t take anything away from what he achieved I m just saying that replacing pellegrini with pep isnt the worst move he is a top manager who is out of contract and pellegrini is out of contract in the summer
I get the logic to sack Pellers but I m not sure I really rate Pep above any of those 3 until he does something to prove himself He s been given one of the 5 best squads in Europe with City and will probably have even more to spend not to mention the entire backroom has been built exactly like Barca s operation but modernised I would like him to take on a challenge for once or I just can t rate him as the best
He seems to be good at building team spirit and getting players to share adapt to his philosophy but a bit like Mourinho his loyalty has to be questioned along with his motives He seems to sign a contract for a few years stick it out and then moves on to fulfill some personal objectives He seems to have no ambition to build a lasting legacy at any club
Pep s system and philosophy of passing and possession may not work so well on a premiership pitch There s just not enough space I would love to be wrong but I doubt it will work The gap between total class and lower teams is so narrow Look at Leicester They play the formula and win they don t they to play possession and tiki taka doesn t work in the Prem They play counter attack and good defence That was Chelsea last season too As good as they are current bayern Munich would probably be happy to be in 3rd place in the Prem right now
BAHAHA you don t think Bayern would be winning the EPL Bahahaha No offense to Leicester City they have been awesome and I love watching them but they are winning the EPL and you don t think Bayern would be you are insane
That guy is either crazy stupid or both
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

Despite some of his tactical naivety he s a phenomenal man manager an advocate for great football and an all around likeable man who steers away from all the drama and controversy that usually surrounds football the latter point was especially important after Mancini He will certainly be remembered fondly by our fans even if he goes to another PL club like Chelsea next summer so here s hoping we can send him off with a trophy or two
For city fans it s like having a breakup with Jennifer Lopez on good terms with no alimony involved and getting Salma Hayek All city fans must be orgasmic
mate you need to update your list of universally desirable women
You young ones wouldn t know a good ass if it sat on your face
Remember this
So i saw this movie with my father after Christmas one year My younger brother came in to tell my dad something and my father made him wait until after her dance was over Once it started to go batshit he asked my brother what it was he wanted The dog ate a canoli
Don t even have to click it to know what it is Salma Hayek will always be my favourite
Raquel Welch and Sophia Loren
Hey Salma Hayek is still desirable I don t care who you are
Won t kick JLo off the bed either
I don t know she s hot and all but I don t necessarily want to be boner bros with Ben Affleck

Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms
I like Affleck I just don t necessarily want to go where he s been
Yeah sleeping with Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez that poor bastard
Damn straight
Who has thighs like that these days Huh buddy No really who
Most of us the old people prefer their girls to be mature and with a decent age gap
I think you re speaking for yourself old man
Shame on you
Guardiola is 45 dude
Even United fans don t outright dislike him I think this says a lot for his character
Couldn t agree with you more
He deserves huge credit for the way he s conducted himself throughout all of this Shown real class
I would love to have him at Chelsea I have found it very difficult to resent City s success with Pellegrini because he seems like such a likeable individual
It s been real Pellers Best of luck to him in whatever he decides to do next
Giggs to City confirmed
I d probably quit football altogether if this happened
Nah it s Pep https twitter com DeadlineDayLive status 694146470602215424 ref src twsrc 5Egoogle 7Ctwcamp 5Eserp 7Ctwgr 5Etweet
Wow I really thought it was going to be Giggs
Sorry your dreams won t be realized in the next three seasons at least
Well you re definitely German
Because I think Giggs at ManCity can happen I m just trying to lessen the disappointment of City not getting Giggs with some hope for a post Pep ManCity future Never lose hope But seriously I am quite curious what he will do next season with City and how the team style tactics will change
Okay now I can t tell if you re trolling everyone or not
I knew the Giggs part was a joke that s why started the first post with a Nah it s Pep Just to deflate possible trolls a bit or people who take the comment to serious and some people in this thread haven t read the full announcement when this thread was posted It was the top post after all The followup posts were just playing along with dream of Giggs for man City and not really serious
damn can you teach me to become a master trollster like you xd
I wanted to latch on the post and inform the people who actually didn t know it but also play along and my first post was a bit of a mess
Fair dues man I definitely took the bate there
I wanted to inform people who didn t know it the announcements came at about the same time and also play along and my initial post was a bit messy in its intention and the follow ups probably led to some confusion
whoosh
really s better Is it needed for every damn post
Well over the internet and when it is near impossible to judge one s intonation yes
So are you really Lasagne
Now that is the ultimate question Are you really a shocking condom
You didn t answer the question
Got hopes up for nothing thanks fella
Im going to miss his stoned expressions
Credit to him his 13 14 side played some of the most attractive and outright scary football I have ever seen Decent bloke too
We missed out because of that side and I still can t bring myself to say something nasty about him Great bloke
He s universally likable because he comes across as a simple decent gentleman He seldom gets into it with other managers is a fantastic man manager at City and has a very calm personality Except according to Pardew he s an old cunt so there s always that
One of my Favourite managers of the Premier League area Always played attacking and dynamic teams and was a gentlemen on and off the pitch Please manage England In a way you a play a 4 4 2
He didn t do much different to what Mancini had built imo Pep was always the target since Soriano arrived and Pellegrini s time in turn had the feel of a caretaker situation Nice chap it seems though he ll be forgotten in a season or two Amazing how far City were ahead of the pack that they could essentially coast for a few seasons while they waited for Pep and still finish 1st or 2nd Pep is going to win the league with his eyes closed at City De Bruyne and Sterling will be sensational they are clearly bought either for Pep or with his guidance
Pep was always the target since Begiristain arrived But to say Pellegrini did nothing different to Mancini is wrong You couldn t really get two more different managers in terms of attitude attitudes towards how the game should be played and tactically They are chalk and cheese and the 13 14 title win was all down to Pellegrini He brought in Navas Negredo and Fernandinho who were all vital to the season He turned Nasri from an outcast in 11 12 back into his best form He changed from a 4231 with very rigid structure into a 442 4 2 2 2 with a completely fluid front 4 He tied the goalscoring record for the league and there was a period when if you went to the Etihad and saw less than 3 goals you felt a little short changed because it was usually more He changed everything and City fans are not going to forget him anytime soon
Oh come off it Mancini s football never reached what Pellegrini s 13 14 did We scored 4 goals or more 17 times that season 17 times I love Bobby and he s going to be a city legend forever because like you said he made us winners but Pellegrini s football was on a completely different level in his first season
Look no further than Mancini at Inter to see he s a defensive manager His formation and player choices going into the Coppa game vs us could not have been more defensively minded
Yet he started a game at Old Trafford against United with Aguero and Balotelli in the XI and won 6 1 I agree he is pragmatic but I disagree with the implication that he cannot produce a side that plays stunning attacking football
And yet in a few seasons football fans that don t support Man City will struggle to remember his name He s been a placeholder for a better manager since he arrived at City
From the way people have spoken about his 13 14 side and the beautiful football they played I don t think any fans of attacking football will forget him in a hurry
Casuals sure
HAD THE FEEL OF A CARETAKER SITUATION
Will he go to another club or will he just go on a sabbatical retire Either way I am excited yet fearful to see Guardiola in the Prem
He s said in a recent interview he s not planning on retiring anytime soon and if he were to lose his job he d prefer to stay in the PL
Would be perfect to go to United to exact revenge
Would be perfect for United as he is a Premier League winning manager with a proven track record of playing exciting attacking football Everything United fans seem to be nostalgic about from the Ferguson years
And he seems like a really good bloke as well
That s a downside for him to United
Revenge for what exactly
Well revenge is a strong way of putting it
Senator Palpatine goes to the dark side
Chelsea it is then
It seems like the split is pretty amicable it s probably been more or less planned from the beginning but it would be quite the twist
Supposedly Pellegrini still wants to stay in Europe I hear Zenit were trying to court him
He said he has no intentions to retire and prefers the Prem due to the level of competition all across You cannot deny this man of pure class and devotion to the game Absolutely respectable
I am crossing my fingers for a Bundesliga club but I don t think he will
I m thinking he might retire after City
He said in an interview recently he didn t want to retire didn t want to manage Chile yet and wanted to stay in the Premier League because he liked the country So who knows where he might turn up Unlike the elite band of coaches Guardiola Mourinho Ancelotti etc his wages are quite low which means he could go to most Premier League teams
If West Ham are serious about building something real with their new stadium and what not they could do worse than to hire him
Don t know about that Bilic is fantastic Everton would be an interesting move Chelsea are supposedly keen I m sure he will have lots of offers
England pls
With how they ve stuck by Martinez I don t see Everton s board as being ambitious enough Chelsea would certainly be a nice move from a pedigree stand point but after his time at Real I don t know that he wants to deal with another domineering owner chairman I kind of just want him to go to west ham because I generally like their fans and think they ve got a shot at building something there right now with the TV money and new stadium incoming
Hello Everton
If I m honest thing I m most gonna miss was his mental assistant I loved watching that guy
Haha Rouben Cousillas I love that guy https pbs twimg com media BfAuLe7IAAEneoa jpg
All the best and respect to all he s done here
Pellegrini would be a good fit for Valencia
He s gonna be good everywhere
As a chilean yes please
deleted
He will be https twitter com DeadlineDayLive status 694146470602215424 ref src twsrc 5Egoogle 7Ctwcamp 5Eserp 7Ctwgr 5Etweet I don t know why they thought this is a good idea and would be less of a burden than if they accidentally meet in the CL
I really hope we can give him a good send off Nothing short off what he deserves
As much as I like pep I hate seeing this man leave
Personally I never liked Pellegrini but I must say that I have the utmost respect for him Absolute class
Would love him to stay in the Prem go to everton or something
Hmm might be a bit difficult managing all 20 Premier League teams
I meant Everton autocorrect I swear
Classy gentleman Sure we may not be playing like champions right now but in his tenure here I think he s got more things right than wrong
M Pellegrini
M anuel
Completely class and professional during his entire tenure I wouldn t be upset if City won just to see him go out a winner
I feel for the United fans I really thought van Gaal staying with Mourinho available right now was a sign that they are in for Pep
To be fair very few United fans thought we would get Pep Him joining City is scary but not surprising The board have denied interest in Pep for months and we ve long since speculated it is to save face for when he is inevitably revealed as City manager
I d be amazed though if United were not trying to get him to change his mind Multiple reports back up that view It ll be interesting to see what happens Van Gaal now if United hit another rocky patch
I m sure we tried but he wasn t interested yeah Then the board tried to act like we didn t want him anyway
Agreed I never actually thought we d get Pep The part that thought we would was more hope and an expectation he d go to a club with prestige Sigh I guess the Barca link was too strong at City
Give him time he s still living in 1999
The part of LvG s appointment which had me most excited was the prospect of Pep succeeding him but the football has been so uninspiring I gave up on that a while ago
Poor Man United they always get it rough don t they
nahh I don t think many people thought we were really going to get him it was just a pipe dream I honestly dunno who we will have after LVG I can t see Mou being willing to just hang out jobless for a while
Could Pellegrini end up at United
It would be funny if man city won the CL
Hope he wins the title this year
I d hope so would be awkward if he stuck around
I wonder if he d go to Chelsea when Hiddink goes at the end of the season
Would be perfect for United as he is inevitably revealed as City manager
Where would he go next It s a question that s been on my mind for a while now Would he go to Valencia To another PL club
Everton and Valencia should be all over him They have players that suit his style and he has managed in both leagues already
If it doesn t work out with Zizou your more than welcome back Pellegrini
Valencia pls
He s not a Mendez guy so i can t see him managing you guys would be perfect tough
Gonna miss him
Good Coach but left too late Thanks if we can find something good about hes time in here
Pellegrini should come to Roma
I m going to miss the awkwardly zoomed in GIFs on his eyes when he s losing 4 1 the most
I hate this nonsense about Pellegrini being treated badly when everyone involved in the club from fans to the board is probably delighted with the decision And everyone club would take Pep too
If he wants a challenge he can come to Valencia
Heres hoping that he takes a break to relax and reflect And buys season tickets to Crystal Palace games sitting directly behind Pardew and heckles him incessantly But he s a professional so I doubt it
Why do man city publicly cuck their managers they even had Mancini sitting in the stand when Hughes was there
Always played attacking and dynamic teams and was a sign that they are in for Pep
What s he gonna say after Pep s already been announced No bitch I ain t gonna leave you ll have to drag my dead body off here lol
I d take him
Welcome Pep make english team successful in the champions league again
Since an English team last won PL has had Benitez LVG Mourinho Pellers Moyes Mancini etc compete in the CL and fail WHo was the last to succeed RDM
GUARDIOLA INTENSIFIES
One of my favourite PL managers nothing but respect for him Teams play attacking football never wades into controversy seems to genuinely respect other teams and managers has a solid track record and his players seem to like him Deserves better but I can t blame City either
I wouldn t mind him taking over at Chelsea
It d be a little awkward if he stayed
Guessing this guy isn t reliable source
Stuart Brennan is in the top shelf of City sources
Stuart Brennan s usually pretty decent for City I think he announced it at a press conference though so it s officially official Everyone will have it soon

Diego Simeone to Chelsea Pellegrini to Athletico
Hello Pep
Biggest plot twist since Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense
Turns out he was bald all along
I wonder who ll replace him
Good manager despite sometimes being tactically inept
Okay now that is out in the open I am wondering where Pep will go now edit yeah you are downvoting my comment before I heard truly fucking pathetic
Yeah obviously going to United
what friends were thinking but i dunno now and as i am writing this i see the front page
I think he is going to Ajax
Man City https twitter com DeadlineDayLive status 694146470602215424 ref src twsrc 5Egoogle 7Ctwcamp 5Eserp 7Ctwgr 5Etweet
yeah i saw after my comment
deleted
I don t see Simeone leaving Atleti but who knows
More likely to be Conte at City Chelsea than Simeone
You mean Chelsea
Yeah oops
Which club in Italy will get him
He s said he wants to stay in England because he likes the country though that doesn t necessarily mean anything I don t necessarily think his philosophy would translate well to Italy but I suppose anything is possible

Pellegrini seems like a top bloke Would be nice to see City have a good CL run under him in his last season
Yeah he could be a good fit but I can t see them making the move for someone coming right out of City tbh
I won t mind having him to be honest at least his football is enjoyable It s been a shit show with Louis Van Gaal
He s got class I don t think it s in him to leave for their direct rivals That s classless
I disagree There are multiple cases of players and managers who worked at both Manchester clubs including George Best Dennis Law and Giggs It doesn t always have to be as acrimonious as the Tevez saga
Our relations with City aren t as bad as most portrait With Liverpool the history is different
I know the history with Liverpool is just so Landscape
There s that Busby bloke as well
Giggs hardly counts He was 12
Ill take it
Denis Law will always be the best Relegating United with a backheel Priceless
Well we were relegated anyway even without that goal
He didn t know that when he put that sweet backheel away
Can t find it now but remember seeing an interview with him about it recall him saying he cried when he went home and he did the back heel because he didn t want to take a real shot and thought there was no way it could go in
Giggs wasn t at all high profile or important to city when he switched to united
But he s also a model professional so I m sure if he received a good offer from them it d be hard to turn them down
I wouldn t be mad at him My favourite City manager in fucking years makes some odd decisions but a good manager I wish him the best no matter where he goes be it United or Macclesfield or wherever
Stranger things have happened
at the end of the day its a business and hes going to go where he sees best fit would respect him wherever he ends up
City kind of fucked him over though
Really After City dumped him unceremoniously
Did they He seems to be fine with the decision he knew a month ago and in that month has he dropped off in terms of the teams form He announced it he seems to understand Pellegrini doesn t seem like one to hold grudges One of the good guys
Then City should also do him the courtesy of not holding a grudge if he gets a chance at the United job
I didn t say they would I said I doubt he d take because he has class
no way in the world would we hold a grudge at least i wouldn t hes done wonders since he arrived played a fun attractive attacking football always a profesional and he s known pep was the end goal even when he initially signed His extention last year was so that the media would get off his back and this way when he leaves hes getting paid a portion of the salary he misses out on next season city management is second to none and they handled this entire situation well
Why not Taking from a rival is much different than selling to a rival
Please no I really like the guy
Welcome to Manchester
Watching how poor United has been under LVG and Moyes I can t help but wonder why they don t just commit long term to Giggs and Scholes I don t claim to know if Scholes even wants to coach but somebody with his level of intelligence should surely be an option right
i would die if pellers went to united hes a quality coach gets underappreciated because hes at city hope all the success in the world to him wherever he decides to go even if it ends up being united see him ending up at chelsea though
They may not want him because of his reputation but they owe us all football fans this Mourinho and Guardiola in the same city is entertainment gold
Pellegrini would probably be too nice of a guy to join his club s arch rivals at least not so soon Him and City seem to respect and value each other
They are not arch rivals lol just because they both have Manchester if their name doesn t mean their brutal enemies
united have a bigger rivalry with liverpool because of the past but as a city fan our 1 rival is united
If you re trying to make a counter argument try and do it without writing in lol in it makes it look a lot less serious City might not be United s immediate arch rivals Liverpool Arsenal etc but United sure are arch rivals The two clubs weren t always on the same level and even now United is still the top rival of City even if it s because of the derby
One Pellegrini please
i would die if this happened because i know he would help settle that sinking ship fingers crossed it doesnt but all the success to him if it does
Imagine if they won the treble and Pellegrini got sacked
treble they re still on for the quadruple right
His original 3 year contract is ending Not quite being sacked
But he signed an extension to remain the manager till the end of 2016 17 season
As a backup plan to give the club security and to get the media to shut up for a bit In the end he gets a nice buy out for the last year Worst case if Pep had gone somewhere else he stays on for another year
Lol gimme a break city are shafting a top manager and seemingly a top guy for Pep Not quite as bad as Bayern getting rid of Heynkes after winning the treble but almost
Same situation already happened at Bayern didn t change a thing Guy was already going
Not saying he s a bad guy but last season he publicly blamed the refs when played against Barcelona it was pretty much a fair game and got suspended for a match or so So he isn t flawless
Pellers real ITK
He s already put his bonus payment down at SkyBet on Pep as City s next manager
I liked Pellegrini Man City has been a bit Marmite for some people since the takeover but I feel he was the pefectly evenly respected guy to even te keel fr them Nice guy doesn t talk bollocks doesn t take shit and was very competent He left a good outsiders impression of him and City imo best of luck to him
City don t deserve Pellegrini
Wat
I think he s joking about all the people in the other threads going on about that Clearly it s a pretty amicable split
Wonder if he had his wife or someone else in the family put a load of money on it down in Paddy Power s
Isn t that pretty illegal
Doesn t stop people doing it though I d imagine I know there was a case with some boxer I think David Haye a few years ago where he joked he had his brother or someone bet that he d knock out his opponent in the 2nd round and when it actually happened there was a farce of an investigation as it had obviously been a joke
There s that Matt le Tissier story out of his autobiography I think where he said he put a bet on for the first throw in of the match and when he tried to boot it out accidentally to make it come true he got nervous and underhit it E http www theguardian com football 2009 sep 22 matt le tissier betting scam There s a news story about it if people are interested
I thought in this case it didn t count I mean it s not like Haye threw the fight if a tennis player bets on himself to win Wimbeldon and then wins they can t just say well you ONLY won because you bet on yourself
No it still counts You re not allowed to bet on your sport full stop Whether it be a match you win lose or even not involved in it doesn t matter
Boxing fighters sometimes bet on themselves
Ah ya I wasn t really comparing them and I remember the case being a complete farce because he was obviously joking Exactly as you say you can t really be accused of match fixing if you re the one who wins
First time seeing a Bangor City flair on this in a long time Hope you guys have a much better half to the season
I think one of the benefits of being a man city manager is never having to worry about money again
1 Pep Guardiola Bayern Munich 14 8m 2 Jose Mourinho Chelsea 10 5m 3 Arsene Wenger Arsenal 8 30m 4 Louis Van Gaal Manchester United 7 3m 5 Jurgen Klopp Liverpool 7m 6 Jose Enrique FC Barcelona 7m 7 Rafael Benitez Real Madrid 5 60m 8 Roberto Mancini Inter Milan 4 30m 9 Antonio Conte Italy 3 95m 10 Manuel Pellegrini Manchester City 4 2m go be ignorant somewhere else
then say I think one of the benefits of being a top club manager is never having to worry about money again i get sensitive whenever money gets involved HAHAHA
my original statement is true regardless of how much other managers make i m not going to change it because you are too sensitive
It s actually sad to see him go Nobody will forget what you did
that s a terrible photo
With all due respect to the man he looks like a corpse in every photo
Wengers 4 years older than him and ranieri is 2 years older
Yes but he coached Real Madrid for a year That s gotta count for 5 years lost at least
He s got something of the night about him A bit vampire y
It s the blood injected blue eyes
Seriously That may be the worst photo to show respect and admiration for the guy
looks like he s weeping over his dead dog
Pellegrini looks like Shadow Realm Wenger some user here
I like this one more
I loved watching his assistant Rouben Cousillas Dude showed all the emotions that Pellegrini s stoic look balanced out
I m extremely curious as to where he ll go next
Conte Chelsea Allegri Azzurri Pellegrini Juventus That s my guess

Would he make a lot more money coaching Italy
Allegri makes 2 million euros a year as Juve manager without bonus and extras The current Azzuri manager is on 3 8 million a year without bonus and extras Skipping over the obvious honour the hour a NT manager makes isnt even in the same league as a club manager Let alone that an appointment for the NT is usually long term if it is not an interim position Besides they have the complete staff resources and facilities of an FA behind them
where exactly is he going to go
Azzurri is nickname for Italy s national squad
not the comment you were supposed to reply to
well rumor has it that the Italian FA are trying to get him for the job when Conte leaves and managers have left for stranger reasons I could see it if Juventus fail to win the league or europe
Would be interesting to see Pellegrini in Serie A i m not sure how well his philosophy would translate
He has already made clear that he wants to stay in England He even hinted that he would finish his managerial career in the PL before moving back home
Yeah that s what I ve hear He s also said he might manage Chile one day but not for a while
buono
That s a good prediction Would you see him back in Spain perhaps at Valencia
Pellegrini has said he d like to stay in the premier league to manage and there will be some vacancies
see him ending up at chelsea he has mentioned he wants to go to a big euro club and said he would prefer to stay in england
He can stay in Manchester I wouldn t mind him taking over from Louis van Lastcentury
Replaced by Mourinho before the end of the season in 2010 Replaced by Guardiola before the end of the season in 2016 I think he s highly underrated
He is the men here for not going against the club and it just makes me feel even more sad for him
It s not like he s getting ousted he signed a three year contract originally and has said he prefers three year projects the one year extension he got last summer was probably just a back up and has the added bonus of requiring the club buy out the remaining year so he should get a decent pay out from all this which he certainly deserves
the public is just not used to clubs and managers having a peaceful and successful tenure come to an end without some drama the city board managed this really well they were happy with pellegrini s work and respected and supported his three year project contract for agreeing to extend a year as interim during a search for new manager causing the least disruption to the club pellegerini was rewarded a nice bonus
man
I learnt it a long time ago if Bayern leaks sth to Kicker it is 100 true signed and sealed Congrats to City
Would be interesting to see him go
He s got class I don t think it s in him to be as acrimonious as the Tevez saga
So did we Manuel so did we
deleted
Yeah I m sure the city board would hate him winning the league and CL for us
Pellegrini has been humiliated Shame as he s very classy
is your comment a joke I m not sure if your being sarcastic
How exactly is he being humiliated o O
Butthurt detected
United will be the one getting humilliated
Even one month in this scenario is a bit short notice
Pellegrini can be Wenger s body double at Arsenal

i swear i forgot Nasri is still playing for Man City
Been seriously injured for a while
We ve really missed him this season at some crucial points His injury was horrific as well Ripped all the muscle off the tendon and then 90 of his tendon of the bone Needed 100 stitches
Jesus H Christ How the hell did he manage that
Then right at the end I played a one two with Fernando and the ball was a little bit behind me we were playing two touch and I had the ball ready to shoot but I could see Aleks coming from behind me I hesitated before I shot and wasn t quite sure what I was going to do I went for the shot and as soon as I did I felt my leg going from under me with no challenge and I just screamed as I hit the ball because the pain was so intense and collapsed on the floor
Aleks should have done him a favour and knocked him unconscious with a free kick so he wouldn t feel the pain
Jesus Christ that s rough
I seriously didn t know that That s fucked up
Kolarov
Yes that s who he was talking about
What does the H stand for in Jesus H Christ
Harold Our Father who art in Heaven Harold be thy name
You have been made a mod of r youdontsurf
Hector
The new John Terry
Haberdasher
No one really knows
Hallowed
Hoo knows
Holy
H
Holy shit was this in training Sounds horrific
Yup Could ve potentially meant us being comfortably winning the league Our away form has really suffered with him gone
A bit optimistic don t you think
Yep really Very hard to manage without Nasri even if Silva Aguero Sterling etc are all fit
Yeah same Worst part is he probably makes more than 90 of the players in the league He must be one of the least likable players of all time
pepe
Nasri is much less likable imo Off the pitch Nasri acts like a cunt his girlfriend too whereas Pepe hasn t shown much like that he s done charity work too
What has he done off the pitch that is so widely disliked minus the whole French national selection team thing Not trying to defend him I m just oblivious
That s just it though his girlfriend The FFF refused to call him up so his girlfriend told them to fuck off Now he s considered the biggest cunt in the planet Yet the worst thing he s ever actually done is leave Arsenal for titles and act out in training for France
And let s face it French players who go their entire career without a fight with the FFF are the minority they all do it
Truth Anelka Henry Evra Gallas Benzema Vieira etc at least 4 out of 6 of them got away with better reputations despite being marginally more poisonous to the team
Maybe that s why they haven t performed on the international stage as well as they should because they clearly have had and do have the players
That s why Deschamps made a big deal out of choosing players that aren t cunts in order to try and get them working well together Though from what I ve seen he s only removed Nasri
Don t forget Ginola and Cantona
Most of the hate is spread from bitter Arsenal fans They can t grasp the concept that some players do not want to spend a decade in mediocrity
It s one thing to leave for titles Another to talk shit when you do win a trophy Nasri chose to taunt Arsenal supporters on a number of occasions which is why most wouldn t piss on the guy if he was on fire That said I don t think Nasri would get in Arsenal s team now And I don t think his attitude would fit into the current era of squad harmony
That explains many of your years before the Sheikhs came knocking
I m sure you d be torn if a rich benefactor came to Arsenal
We ve had Usmanov knocking on the door for years and I m not sad we don t let him in
He cut me up in his Lambo like a complete prick on the bypass the other day Confirmed his prick status for me
Well
off the pitch pepe is pretty nice
Pepe is a complete psycho even of he is kept in check currently could have ended the careers of a lot of players
Nasri is just a bit of a cunt Pepe is a genuine psycho who s repeatedly hurt people out of pure rage The two aren t comparable
Jordi Alba
bringing the bants
Nasri s French though
I mean if you haven t watched a Real Madrid game in 3 years I could see why you d dislike Pepe Unlike Nasri though he doesn t hate jews and represents his country because he doesn t get into fights with his teammates
He s only unlikeable to France and Arsenal fans For the neutral he s sensational And while lesser players are hated for their arrogance Nasri s arrogance makes him even more likable
This sub is r mcfc today I love it
No there s actually people posting stuff here
Cmon you ve got to have an emptyhad joke in you
No putting any effort into Manchester Shitty jokes
Hopefully we can live up to the hype All those pre money days still always make me have doubts even when things are really looking good
I thought youth players didn t need to be registered for the UCL Am I missing something
After we signed Balotelli and registered him as u21 he was 20 at the time UEFA changed the rules so that u21 players have to be at the club for 2 years before qualifying as u21 So Kalechi signed in October 2014 which means he has to be registered this year but for the second half of 16 17 and the whole of 17 18 he will be u21 and qualify for the B List It s really stupid
I see Cheers Was wondering why Roberts etc couldn t play
Pellegrini doesn t have to care too much about squad harmony now as long as he can pull the team through to a decent end to the season it s not his problem if fringe players like Nasri get too upset It also makes sense bringing in Iheanacho considering Bony s lack of form when he s played
I don t really think that s how Pellegrini is going to finish his time at City and I can t imagine Nasri being too upset it s been quite likely since he was badly injured and it is possible the CL run will be over before he returns so it makes complete sense
Iheanacho coming good would also be something City would love tbf it s not like Pellegrini would be pissing off the management
Yeah it s not as if a healthy Nasri is getting dropped Rather have a good young striker in the squad now over a potentially returning to form Nasri later
It s Nasri he can be upset at anything and everything
Were City fans ever excited about the Bony purchase Not that s he s a bad player but I never saw him as an excellent player on Swansea Just a good player on a mid table team
In a word no Seemed over priced at the time and we signed him just before he disappeared off to ACON for several weeks so it was all a bit pointless
Truuue I forgot about Afcon I don t want to say he s one of the worst January purchases ever but I will say City could have done better At least with Pep the spending on players will be sensible
dunc you handsome sonovabitch
Oh aye
I knew that username could only be you
Just a matter of time before some Chinese club drops 40 mill for him
City don t need the money besides dude is not even 20 yet he can become a legend at the club for crying out loud
I d guess he was talking about Nasri
Yea apparently he is lol
how do you pronounce his name In my head I read it like ikea the furniture company but with an H instead of the K followed by nacho like the dank mexican tortilla chips that cant be right can it
I ve heard it pronounced as Ee hee ah nah cho by the folks on MCFC s Youtube channel so I assume that s correct
i can t find the source right now but i think he said himself it was conveniently like Ian Atcho So I m going to go with Ian Nacho which is close enough And also awesome edit source
E ya na cho The cho is pronounced like you re talking to say chalk but without the lk part It s difficult to sound out Nigerian names accurately but that s the best approximation I can come up with
He said after the game it s pronounced Ian Atcho which is the best explanation I ve seen so far
Sounds like a Bond villain
Pellegrini looks like he has a terrible illness in that picture But cheers to him being such a gentleman
old guy looks old
This isn t even surprising Iheanacho seems to always produce a positive performance when he plays Nasri on the other hand
Absolutely carried the squad to the 2 0 win over Roma in the CL group stage last season that pushed City through to the round of 16 and that s just off the top of my head I don t remember him having any more bad games than any other player in his tier
we don t win the title in 13 14 without him He was massive
Fairplay to him
Nasri still getting checks smh
Cheques as well
It s spelled check in America spare him
Who s checking him
the doctor
Fuck nasri he is the olny footballer i despise for no reason he just seems lack a total duchbag
but tell us what you really think
Just remember how hard it is to look like a lesbian in professional male sports He isn t the worst person https youtu be vQIFDvvN9rE t 690
that s nice of you
Serves that cunt right
Let it go bro
I was a bit harsh just never enjoyed his attitude Either in Arsenal Man City or playing for France
What attitude has he shown at City Pretty much always been a model professional for them
And he hates that How dare Nasri not act like the cunt he s so sure he is
That s why arsenal fans are so upset Did such a quality job with city they saw what he could have meant to them this whole time
That s just wrong Nasri never reached the heights of 2010 11 with Manchester City He did such a quality job with us that we saw what he could mean to the team which is why it sucks we had to sell him for way under his value Won French footballer of the year at 23 and then we had to sell him six months later I am happy those days are over
He s been pretty shit for Man City to be honest Steadily going downhill since he left Arsenal when he should ve been at his prime
Hahaha no
He shouldn t be in his prime now He s only 28 years old after all
Needs to have all his muscles attached to his leg first
Live and let live dawg xx
I suppose you re right
He s been nothing but a professional at City though
I can only recall his attitude being a problem twice in his 5 years at city Once against Barcelona last year and late during the Mancini era Besides that he has been a great professional for us
That username together with that comment
The schadenfreude aspect is quite amusing but it s a genuine shame to see a player who can defenders do stuff like this so out in the cold Is a move on the cards for him soon He could be a key player for a slightly smaller side
He s injured until mid March that s why he s out
He s wiping his tears with his premier league medalsGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
Can he play in the Copa It would be hilarious if he won it
Yes he can
How if he already played for Madrid
Game void because he was ineligible No one technically played so he serves ed his ban and then plays for Valentia Edetanorum
How can he have served his ban if they game was ruled void
Ahh okay fair enough Was just asking in case anyone knew the official ruling It ll be interesting to see what happens though
He means his original ban for which he wasnt supposed to be playing in the game where they got disqualified
I got what he meant I was just asking what the official rule is
Because that is a European competition rule and not a Copa rule probably
Fair enough Learn something new every day
I just learned it as well
Will always love Denis
Same Unfortunate that he plays in a position that we have so much depth already Would ve kept him over Vazquez
I dunno I was very impressed with Vazquez whenever he played so far
Yeah I disagree Btwn Jese Dennis and Vasquez I ve been most impressed with Vasquez Especially on the RIGHT wing and it s not even close Jese is very dynamic on the left flank but on the right he s limited He s only good for using his pace to push the ball up the field but once he gets into the attacking 1 3 he can t do anything but pass to Modric of Carvajal disrupt a counterattack some how or send a silly cross by the net Vasquez is better at dribbling his way out of tight spots on that side and he links up better with the attack as well With Cheryshev although he never played on the right IIRC whenever he played on the left he never played as well as Jese did So out of the 3 it made most sense for him to leave
Now all Valencia need is another centreback some midfielders and a new manager
And a new owner
And Mendes gone
And my axe
and Cheryshev s fax
and munchlax
Don t forget a less insufferable fan base
How dare you
Great player He deserves more time
He was great for Villareal last season
So Can he play in the game against Barca or not
I think he has a match ban but i am not sure
Neville can use playmaking ability and creativity regardless of age Plus the boy can learn a lot
I bet the thought of a free Neville ipad convinced him to sign
I m glad he s going somewhere to hopefully be getting more playing time Has performed well when called upon and was currently being wasted with us
The guy is really really keen on playing CdR football
Cool 25 year old winger who almost hasn t played in a year On loan for 6 months with no clause to sign If a central midfielder isn t signed before midnight we will really struggle
Do you think you ll be signing Danilo or has he been that bad
I suspect we have to He is talented though just not ready yet
We are forced to pay 15M for the 50 of Danilo next season thanks Mendes
No option to sign cheryshev Are you serious What the fuck is this
That is what the sources say
This would be useless then I don t think he s any better than De Paul
Well De Paul is back in Argentina The difference that make Cherychev a better option is that he is capable of going on the outside as a classic winger and Valencia shall always use wingers but I would rather just have Piatti out the season and someone to balance the midfield that isn t injured every second week
Why is this being down voted do people think he s younger than he actually is
Right move for him
I feel like LW is our strongest position besides GK with Piatti being decent lately Bakkali playing very well and theoretically Rodrigo could play out there and Gaya in a pinch So this is even more odd than the Siqueira one From what I saw of him at Villarreal I do think Cheryshev could be better than them but if only a loan not sure why
Camp Nou will give him a standing ovation
The crowd should make a tifo for him as well
Whatever people say props to Cheryshev He could ve earned like 5 mln per year in Russia yet he chose to fight for a place in Spain
He should have left in the summer Wasn t even called up even though he could have been given a chance at LB
If he can get anywhere close to his Villareal form then Russia will be very thankfulGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
They re cutting the budget
tough economy
Well that rules them out of getting Lionel Messi at least
They could buy 4 Andy Carrolls though
It s nice that you can laugh about it now

Or 5 5 Fellainis
Or one Fellaini for 150 million times more than what he s worth
You won t be laughing when we sign him this summer
We have one available right now
They can and will sell a couple of guys tho But reality rules out Lionel Messi Not money
Implying that was ever on the cards
Are they talking about the same Guardiola who played in Qatar
You re ruining the illusion
Also his old club literally has Qatar on their fucking shirts And were involved in two pretty big transfer scandals recently Not to mention when People think of footballing romance in the context of ownership I m sure they re totally overcome with affection at the thought of the Glazers or Roman Abramovich Or how about hicks and Gillett
Pep has nothing to with the Qatar sponsorship or with the legal clusterfucks that have been going on recently In fact I think all that sort of shit was one of the many reasons why he decided to leave the club
I never said he was involved with that My point is deciding which big clubs are more pure than the others is waste of time because where do you draw the line
YOU SHUT YOUR WHORE MOUTH PEP WAS THE CLASSIEST MAN IN FOOTBALL AND HE PROSTITUTED HIMSELF
Such an insanely wrong statement too Success has ALWAYS been bought at some level And from sustained success naturally follows a winning tradition and I m no City fan but to say they don t have tradition is pretty fucked up just because they weren t winning titles 10 to 20 years ago
I think he means a pedigree as opposed to tradition
City have a good pedigree don t they A solid blue collar fan base for 100 years
So should he only go to clubs that bought their success long enough ago that we ve forgotten how they got big I don t really like the fact that Wednesday have to have a multi millionaire on board to have a chance at getting anywhere and it certainly cheapens the meaning of City or Chelsea s success that its somewhat arbitrary It could have been SPurs or Leeds or Villa or whoever else that had a billion chucked at them But its not like City are some no marks they ve always had a huge devoted fanbase and they d won plenty of trophies pre Billionaire plaything status They ve got plenty of tradition and history of their own even if its not quite at the level of the likes of Man Utd or Liverpool And in 50 100 years they ll seem as old money establishment as those guys and someone else will be hammered for trying to buy success
I like you Seriously though man city has existed in some form since 1880 and we do have plenty of history Granted some of it is a history of us being rubbish but it a still history damn it
M Football is no longer le classy
fucking friendzoned by Pep
m qatar fedora tion
The sad thing is that the comment was almost certainly made by a United fan a club who shall we say had just a little bit to do with the current situation of football being dominated by money
Wonder how that guy will react when he rask realises Pep was tested positive for nandrolone during his career
Sounds like the ramblings of Eamon Dunphy
I don t get it
I don t get it
Another tough gig for Guardiola
Let s be honest out of the teams rumoured to be in for him he would ve gotten the same
yeh mate he should have joined Blackpool to prove himself eh
I am genuinely curious what would happen if Wenger Mourinho etc did this
Wenger got relegation with his first managerial club Nancy in Ligue 1
Pellegrini also got us relegated on his first job as a manager
Didn t know that Then again he wasn t at the level of experience he s at now
And he won Japanese league with Nagoya
We were so close to signing wenger then Although he wouldn t stay for us more than a few years
Mourinho did that He got hired by a bigger team won the UEFA Cup and Champions League with that team and then he moved to Chelsea and had a record breaking season
Im a bit confused here but are you talking about Porto As in you are comparing Porto a huge European team with great resources and incredible football pedigree to Blackpool
DAE Pep has to prove himself with a shit club He can t be considered good until he wins the champions league with Sheffield Wednesday
I like how here and other topics discussing Pep to City people are indirectly calling Real a run of the mill team by calling La Liga easy to win
While Real were a top team for the entirety of Guardiola s time at Barca he did have probably the best squad ever playing for him
I think Barca s squad now is probably better It s largely the same except for no Xavi and Suarez and Neymar which IMO makes up for it The reason that side was so great was the way they played
I probably should said that they were the best squad ever at the time
Don t forget Puyol Tho Barca have a pretty solid defense nowadays too
That s a bit chicken and egg no No doubt players like Xavi Messi Iniesta were massively talented but other than those three the team wasn t that exceptional Yeah I do realise how ridiculous that sounds The vision of those players was is massive but I was always more impressed with the way they were playing tiki taka and not so much the individual exploits of those players I m sure the talent massively helped him but I do sincerely doubt other managers with different playing styles eg Mourinho could ve gotten their potential completely fulfilled like that
Right But he had a HUGE hand in making them the best squad ever I mean the season before he became manager they finished behind Villarreal
come on now inheriting comfortably the best squad in the league as well as a 150m budget he s playing on semi pro
If he can get City to perform at their best in the Champions League assuming Pelligrini doesn t manage to do it this year it will be seen as a huge accomplishment
yeah look how the best squad is performing choking on every away game and still unproven on Europe You re all talking as if he s going to be the manager of PSG and the PL is Ligue 1
What does that even mean Would you take a more shit job with less pay than the one you have now just to prove that you can do the job you have now The dude has won like 19 trophies in 6 full years as a manager He s won the CL twice and always at least made the semis He took a Barca team that finished a distant 3rd got rid of most of its biggest names promoted some unknown youngsters and in the process created one of the best teams in history If it was so easy then we wouldn t see managers ever fail at big clubs But when Pep continuously succeeds people say that somehow it s easy Just ridiculous Does anyone have a good argument as to why Pep should ever take one of those jobs if he can manage the very top clubs Because so far I haven t seen one
It means go for a team in a transition that s still got world class players and money in the bank Man United is the obvious one or Chelsea He said he wanted to test himself in the EPL a new challenge this isn t that at all
His point is that Pep already did that with Barca We weren t exactly on top of the world when he took the club over
But that s the thing it s not FIFA Nobody expects the world s leading CEOs to take on some local company to prove their worth Nobody expects Hillary Clinton to go run as mayor just so she can prove she can do it at a local level Because in those fields unlike sports people recognize that the world s best don t need to prove anything to fans Only in football would someone criticize a manager for going after the best possible job because it doesn t meet their stupid fucking expectations
Except in your analogy its the opposite Leading a country is actually much more difficult than leading a small town whereas the general consensus is that it s easier to lead Bayern to CL glory than Sheffield Wednesday
What did we do to deserve this
It s like criticizing someone for taking a promotion or job with another company If you get offered a job from another company that pays more than you earn you re probably going to take it No one in any profession says yeah I think I m going to actually go to a different employer to do something that s significantly worse than what I m doing right now
It s not really a criticism so much as a statement of fact Pep always takes over the best teams in every league he manages and succeeds like you d expect This isn t really a controversial statement or debatable Obviously he s never going to take over a mid table team so we ll never know how much of his success was down to sheer managerial ability as opposed to having the best players along with insane budgets
Saying this makes you look witty and gives your comment upvotes but come on now Tata Martino managed to go trophyless while in charge of a Barca side that had Messi Neymar and Alexis as the front 3 essentially the same backline that Luis Enrique currently has and World Cup winning midfielders like Busquets Iniesta Fabregas and Xavi
comfortably the best squad in the league Good thing they re leading in the PL standings right now s
right but c mon what other team has been as consistent in the PL over the past few years
But after an offseason where they signed De Bruyne Otamendi and Sterling and everyone claiming the PL was over in September they re currently trailing Leicester and tied with Arsenal On paper they may appear to be the best squad in the league but that isn t correlating to their actual performance so it must not be as easy as it may seem
City s also been hit the hardest by injuries though I would say
You have a point to be made but you picked the poopiest format for it
I mean everyone knows that Pep is good The question is whether he s great
He s no Brian Clough though
I would like to see him manage a slightly weaker top team Someone like Arsenal Dortmund or Atletico
Pep is so good that it s literally the only criticism you can give him
why would he take a tough gig
If he joined Chelsea would you say the same Genuinely curious
This coming from a Chelsea fan
How much the amount translate into your currency
Hold on while I send that to NASA to calculate
A touch over 78 Billion ZWD
Damnit Pep do not even look at us We want no part of your blue money unless it s for Ramos
Yes plz 20 Mil for Ramos D
What happened to Ramos He was very good for Hertha
He has had chances to show his abilities however he never really shines He s been a cog in some important plays but other than that he can t finish or pose as a threat up top
Just enough for Joe Allen
In that case he d have Xavi back in his squad The Welsh that is
I would hazard that our bench Roberto Bartra Rafinha etc is getting raided EDIT I forgot about Samper Also I want him to buy Grimaldo from Benfica and then watch r barca riot
Please not Roberto
He can take bartra They never make him play anyways but please leave rafinha and Roberto alone
Bartr and Rafinha are quite possible but don t think we d let Roberto go
Pep will be given whatever he needs He is arguably the worlds best manager for a team aiming to join the elite in world football so if its going to take 220m to bring in the players he needs I m sure that s what he ll be given I reckon City need a new CB LB RB CM and backup CM and Striker which I imagine will cost an awful lot more 150m Just keep in mind that Mangala and Bony together cost City almost 70m
I think LB is far more of a priority than RB Clichy has been injured a lot this year and Aleks has been decent Gaya is who I d put my money on if I were a betting man Zaba Sagna have been fantastic this year and I d say they collectively have more in the tank than their left sided counterparts It ll be interesting to see what he does with Angelino and Maffeo both young Spanish fullbacks in our youth system
Ok Not like Pellegrini didn t bring in good players with the money he was given got the best young talent in the world probably the best AM at the time and ones of the best defenders
Sorry May i ask who you mean with the best young talent
Raheem twatface Sterling
Considering that this is relative to the EPL he s brought in some considerable young talent I consider KDB and Sterling to be in that category Some others with potential are Mangala Unal and Roberts
Plus after the fire sale that should be around an extra 100m
There are some wrong assumptions here like Bayern players following him which won t happen I think Guardiola will try to rebuild City s midfield by going after the kind of players like Gundogan Weigl Oliver Torres Andre Gomes and players alike He will also go after fullbacks like Gaya could be a target for him He may go for a RB and a couple of ball playing defenders as well If he has money left maybe after selling some players he may go after Griezmann and maybe some Barcelona youth players I don t think he ll go after many or any Premier League players I think he ll sell at least 3 or 4 players
150m Euros isn t enough to get anyone vital to Bayern to follow him anyways
150 pounds not Euros plus the players he ll sell Still I don t see any Bayern players following him I don t think he ll try either
Whoops only gave the number a quick look musta substituted the Euros in on accident
Why are all Bayern players worth 300
It s about 200m Euros 150m pounds
deleted
Or maybe someone like I aki Williams or anotherup and coming talent But since he ll most likely start with 4 3 3 he ll need a 3 man midfield with 3 good central midfielders so I think midfield is where he ll start Just a hunch Manchester City don t have the kind of midfielders Guardiola prefers
No No No I like I aki right where he his No No No
That s quite an accurate list of players that we have been linked with I also agree that a set of fullbacks is probably the highest priority and with a major lack of them not already at established clubs the board have their work cut out for them I d also wager that we won t buy any players from the PL as they re very few that would improve the squad
This isn t a dig at City or anything but can City even spend that due to FFP
FFP is Platini s baby I honestly think we can kiss that thing goodbye
FFP is nowhere near as much of an issue as it was So yes they can
Pay in yearly installments new sponsors etc
Transfer fees have always been amortised over the length of the players contracts in accounts Paying in instalments is just a cash flow issue
City where actually well known for paying transfer fees upfront at some point Just a fun fact
City did a thing with their contracts shortly after FFP where players wages were massively reduced and they d receive the rest in bonuses
The way they structure costs allows them to make annual payments in purchasing players but when they sell players it counts as a lump sum Sell a player for 30 million you could buy a player that costs 150 million over 5 years 150m 5 Years 30million year and you would be even
They ll get another 50m year starting with the new TV deal next year alone
We can because the club itself is making much more revenue than before We can spend more money because we make more money
Yes
the club is self sufficient now We turned in a profit last year even after spending well over 130 mil on players It s not an issue also FFP is really soft now
Does FFP even still exist
yes
Which players in the premier league do you guys think he ll go for
Joe Allen obviously
Stones
wouldn t mind a Chelsea Citeh bidding war tbh
Think United and some big European teams could get involved also
Not quite Messi s buyout clause
I see him going for Pogba
We ll probably go for him but like this summer I doubt we ll be successful the price and wage demands for him are out of this world
If only you had the money to pay for it
We obviously have but at some point you have to be at least slightly responsible Raiola was asking for Pogba to be our highest paid player and Juve were expecting 70m he s not worth anywhere near that
We don t which is one of the reasons we didn t get him this summer
The player s terms won t be a problem The big issue is whether Pogba has sorted his image rights out that s the only thing that stopped us making a bid They made the transfer fee too huge
I could see them going for him and also Reus
Peoppe suggesting the likes of Pogba Alaba M ller Thiago Messi Etc Basically any player on Real PSG Barca Bayern and Juventus are just wasting their time speculating
The exact same thing happened when it was announced Pep would be coming to Bayern Besides Thiago I can t think of any other player that has come or gone even because of Pep
I see him buying a striker wing forward Aguero s a bit injury prone and Bony s maybe not good enough back up Unless he does a 180 and makes De Bruyne Sterling a False 9 or something
By the time pep arrives Iheanacho will be the second choice striker if he isn t already
what do City need to improve central midfield for one probably their fullbacks too maybe a bit more depth in attack are they losing anyone this summer
their defense completely lost without Kompany
I expect the defence to improve a lot without even any signings being made It s always been Pellegrini s biggest weakness
yeah that s what they signed Otamendi for but he hasn t been that great I think i could be wrong though they do need depth but they have Denayer who I believe is a highly rated talent who has been playing somewhere else on loan Sagna has had a good season Zabaleta has been injured for much of the season City definitely need to get a better left back I think earlier in January they were linked to Ricardo Rodriguez
Denayer is fantastic he ll take over from Demichelis straight away The problem with the defence is more systematic than idividual players I don t think it s worth talking about which players are staying or going yet because Pellegrini s defensive system is so weird that every CB we ve ever had has struggled Kompany was being called one of the best CBs in the world and then after a year of Pellegrini s system people were saying he was horribly underrated Nastasic went from one of the most promising CBs in Europe to an outcast Lescott dropped off a cliff Mangala was hugely rated hence the price tag but he s never fully got it despite some periods of great form he always seems to have a mistake And Otamendi has initially struggled before doing really well and now is making mistakes So is it that all these highly rated defenders have stepped foot in Manchester and forgotten why they were good Or are the exposed by a very high line with fullbacks who play as wingers and only a box to box midfielder in Fernandinho protecting them Pep will play a higher line but the rest of the defensive system will be totally different and it s hard to say who will and won t suit that
you re right the quality is there I did forget about Mangala too Guardiola is one of the smartest coaches in the world if he isn t able to fix City s defence I doubt many others can it should be interesting to see who he signs can t think of many players City have been linked to recently
We ve been mostly linked with very young players Julien Weigl at Dortmund Leroy San at Schalke I aki Williams at athletic Bilbao It makes sense as if pep is only here for 3 4 years you want him to leave behind a core of players who he s left a permanent impression on and will carry on the success after he s gone If you look at Pique Pedro Busquets Messi they ve carried on his work whereas if you ve got an old squad they ll all retire and you have to replace the squad soon and the legacy has gone Whoever comes or goes it will be an exciting time for a city fan
I feel like a lot of that is Pellegrini s system it s not fit for defenders and makes them look a lot worse than they are And with all that we ve only conceded 23 goals this season 4th lowest behind Arsenal 22 United 21 and Tottenham 19 I don t think we need more CBs Pep will be able to make Kompany and Otamendi flourish I agree with the need for a new left back though Neither Kolorav or Clichy look like they are going to get much better
This is obviously me speculating out of my ass but I would think Pep is going to want a ball playing CB and some new FBs all of City s FBs are over 30 Yaya was gone the day Pep signed the contract so he ll need to be replaced Past that it s a matter of how he wants to build his team I m most interested to see how he s going to try and fit David Silva and KdB into the lineup When they re both fit City has to play them both and their options at RW are mostly shit so putting KdB out there ends up working out alright The team looks much more cohesive when either KdB are Silva are on the bench and there are two natural wide players on the field IMO At Barca pepe always had great wide players and at Bayern he s made the wingers the focal point of his attack Neither KdB or Silva playing as a winger offer Pep what he wants out of someone playing wide I m really not sure what he s going to do
KdB could probably pull it off on the wings It will be interesting to see if he maybe tries to push Silva further back and have him play a role more similar to Iniesta or something like that
I think that s very likely to be his thought process You ll have the back 4 and then I think Dinho with Yaya replacement say Gundogan for arguments sake I think he d roll out with Silva in the iniesta role with Gundogan as a deep playmaker with Dinho just causing a ruckus with his engine Then I think Sergio will be up top with Raheem and Kevin on the wings I think Sterling under pep will explode Can t wait
I think he will Play them both centrally with DeBruyne more advanced If you could observe one thing during Peps career it is that he dislikes traditional strikers and prefers midfielders there More so he basically prefers midfielders everywhere He once said that everyone can go into the box as long as no one s stays there
Pogba Gaya Fabinho Lacazette Stones Casemiro Thoughts Suggestions
This would be amazing Rodriguez over Gaya is debatable Gaya is way faster and has more stamina which may suit Pep more but Ricardo is better technically and has an awesome left foot Haven t really seen Casemiro perform but I d really like Krychowiak from Sevilla total beast
Na man Lacazette is going to Newcastle
I m gonna go with Nainggolan Fits peps profile for a DM and should be reasonably priced compared to overvalued players
Well fuck
If they don t do it for him they ll do it for the team The bulk of these players are extremely motivated Aguero Sterling Otamendi Hart KDB Iheanacho and Fernandinho all come to mind they have passion brother
Now that the whole world knows how much he has to spend the minimum asking price per player will be 50 million for players Pep wants Not the best idea to disclose these things
They haven t disclosed it it s just newspapers doing their usual thing
Yes because otherwise clubs would have no idea about how much money we d be willing to spend
Imagine that you could be like Stoke and get bargains like Imbula for 18m
The media have only just been told that Pep will be the manager any other story is just a means to bleed the story dry at this point They don t know anything else
To me Pep is a lot like Phil Jackson former basketball coach for the bulls and lakers He s coached some of the greatest players teams but he s experienced a level of success that most other coaches wouldn t be able to even with those teams
n Appel und n Ei Can t even get you Messi
I think we will need replacements for Kolarov Sagna Toure and Nasri I am hoping Denayer can fill in Demichelis spot Rest should be okay
I imagine the midfield and fullbacks will be the priority areas for him
for the first month of the summer window then for the second
Is that all Sack the board
Oil prices are at an all time ow I guess everybody s feeling the pinch
And who is gonna be kicked out like ronaldinho or deco
Ya Ya Yadios
How is anyone meant to know this information It s possibly true but i mean it s not like the Man City exec s are running around telling people they re gonna give 150m on transfers is it Total non story
What bayern players do Citeh really think they can get Thiago I cant think of another really and even then hes a stretch
I wonder if he tries for Thiago and Kimmich
I ll have one Messi please
deleted
That s why I m kinda in favour of a super league means they ll be more competition between the super clubs and in the domestic leagues
deleted
Woah there
So 3 Sterlings
3 The budget is 150 mil mate
That s only 198 80M he ll need 250M for Messi EDITED M
Two hundred and fifty euros for Messi In that case I ll buy him for my 5 a side team
Still got to pay his wages though
He s probably going to try and sign ter Stegen There s no way Joe Hart is able to play Guardiola style Not after he had 3 years of Neuer
I think the fans might revolt if he did that Joe s been with the club for 10 years now and is better than Ter Stegen I d hate to see that
I don t think Barca has any plans of letting MAtS go
Joe Hart is too good to just replace like that He s not the same type of keeper as Neuer obviously but he s definitely top class A good manager isn t going to just sell off all the quality in the team because they don t fit his chosen style of play at first glance
Don t be silly Hart is nailed onGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
Smashing thumbs up stance Welcome to the club lad
Oh that s right off the top shelf
I see why you bought him worth every penny that
Couldn t have asked for a better start to be honest
Take that over any crap Melwood lean every day of the week Top form
You take that back
Yeah but can he look into the distance with this level of sex appeal
Oh fuck how did I miss this
Probably ejaculated so hard you knocked yourself out and woke up with amnesia
How many clubs give you a look at the player actually signing the contract though
How many clubs give you a photo of a 4 time African player of the year winner signing his contract alongside the mug shot of a presumed local sex offender We do that s who
Who s the sex offender
I have no idea but look at that fucking hair and the smile there s something going on there Tell me that pale hand hasn t been places it s not meant to have been Affectionately known as contract nonce
Dave Contract Nonce Harrison That s who he is
That s hilariously bonkers
Nah look at the production value we offer
Really accentuates the nipples
Like Cooney s batsuit
Where s Contract nonce It s just not the same without him
I am excited but when they said his name on Sky Sports News it sounded like Oumar In The Ass I am hoping this means he has been bullied all his life and is of strong character
Is this Everton s equivalent to the lean
I m a little teapot short and stout they keep me on the bench by the fairy liquid
Oumar s coming yo
all in the game
Indeed
Get in Desperately needed another striker disappointed at the so far lack of contract nonce though
Here s contract nonce for the uninitiated
10 10 nonce like behaviour there confirmed nonce
I remember a little while ago The Echo did a special article introducing him in an attempt to stop people calling him contract nonce haha
Too old mate he ll be watching the U21s play
http i imgur com d9rHGAn jpg Some cracking goal scoring stats there
Fuck me he s scored 66 goals within an hour of signing for them
Fixture lists are ludicrous this year 41 games in his first day
sky is behind it all ffs
That deadline day schedule really sorts the men from the boys
Born in Scousetown Senegal classic
For a second I was like Whoa there s a Scousetown in Senegal
Very interesting that Everton actually announced the amount they ve paid Quite rare in top flight football in England Even when the other side says it through a stock market filing or something you usually don t see the English team confirm the number publicly
We did it with Lukaku too and rounded it up to include all possible addons etc too iirc We must be wanting to give off the image that we have money for some reason
More likely to stop people going on about the Arteta money
People would never have gone on about it in the first place if we d actually signed someone with it Those were hard transfer windows
Where is that again
Last seen in the latest Mission Impossible film
Classic
what s the story behind arteta money
We sold Arteta then didnt sign a senior player for two years
So I m guessing that whole reddit breaking news thing didn t work out for you
Nothing official as of yet
Lots of undisclosed fees going about these days Really annoying to fans
Probably to be like Guys look We spent money We released how much we spent on most of our signings in recent years
Scored 789 goals in 34 appearances for Akhisar Belediyespor He s the next Pele
Found the Arteta money
I have no idea why but i m not even slightly excited by this signing Seems like a massive risk in a position we don t need someone in Everyone is saying it s a Naismith replacement but Naismith hasn t played for about 3 months I hope he s good though
Wow I hadn t heard about this
Hello Everton fans remember the team you quite comfortably knocked out of the UEFA cup early 2008 Yup that s us We had Oumar Niasse on loan at our club in 2012 and he wasn t even good enough to play for the second team Seems like things change we suck balls at seeing the potential in players
Why is this guy worth 13 mil
He s scored 12 goals and got 10 assists in 21 games Also that s what they asked for and we said ok
Because you bought Andy Carroll for 35m
Not a good idea to take transfer negotiation tips from Liverpool
take a look at his stats http i imgur com d9rHGAn jpg
Yeah those aren t real
No trust me that s real Have you never been to Scousetown in Senegal
Lovely town Low crime rate and beautiful weather
Wow
Remember this guy flopping for Brann in the Tippeliga That s football I guess
I dont understand why they would dish out 13 5m on a striker when that is their strongest area Should be looking at a defensive mid
Needed to replace Naismith No other plan B up front otherwise Have plenty of DMs already Barry McCarthy Besic
I forgot about selling Naismith ops Do you think you need to buy any defensive players or the ones you have to play better Or a goal keeper
People forget how banged up our defensive line has been Stones has played most of the games but neither Jagielka nor Baines have played in even half of our matches this season We don t need new players back there we need the existing ones to stay healthy
Another cb or rb would be nice Defensive mid shouldn t be that much of a worry though
Most of us would love a new keeper but it won t happen until the summer which is fine because it isn t the position you want to bring someone into the starting 11 midway through the season
How s Robles seemed this year Would he be better than Tim at the moment
Robles looks much better than the two years prior when he would make me a nervous wreck He has only appeared in cup games this season and hasn t made any glaring mistakes I can recall Last year he got some league appearances because Tim was injured and he started to come into his own right in time for Tim to get fit and then he was dropped immediately I would have liked to seen him get a longer run in the league and since he hasn t I would expect us to sign someone new to replace Tim when he goes
Only really right back cover but we seem to be making Oviedo into a duel right back left back I personally think as it stands we have the personel at centre back we just need to be more tactically astute and stop the individual errors
Plus with 2 deep we can play Barkley Gibson Cleverley even Osman if it comes down to it alongside any of Barry McCarthy or Besic
We literally don t have any other strikers for starters One injury to Lukaku and we are totally and utterly effed beyond belief
Our backup to lukaku is currently kon who is trash This guy can also play on the wing which is something we need
Our central midfield is already ridiculously clogged the last position we need to buy is a defensive midfielder Rom is our only striker no kone doesn t count this is a very astute buy for the club
Why would we need a DM we have Barry Besic and McCarthy youngsters coming through Gibson and Cleverley to deputise
It s actually our weakest area or rather it was Lukaku is fantastic no doubt but if he got injured our only back up was Kone which really wasn t good enough
Because any betting man would have Lukaku leaving us in the summer and with him gone its our weakest point once again
Rumours Holland are in for him
Solid looking signing Might be preparing for Lukaku moving on in the summer
He s a replacement for Naismith who we sold for 8m last week
Reckon he ll be taking over Kone s role myself of winger generally and striker for cup games when we rest Lukaku
Yeah me too Kone is awful
Suppose we should see how he does before saying we prefer him to Kone but he better be a fucking improvement if we re spending the third most we ve ever spent on a player on him I m quite hopeful though Bob has yet to fail when spending a decent amount of money and his general performance in the transfer window has been top notch
Wasn t he quite good earlier this season or did I just imagine that
Yeah he was and he at least scores goals occasionally now but he s really not good enough
And was ace for Norwich in the game that defending forgot it has to be said
I thought he d do well against Liverpool his first goal for us was against them too
You shut your filthy mouth
Dafuq did this come from
Only really been known about for a day or two First we heard of it the deal was seemingly nearly done think he arrived in England yesterday
The Everton facebook page has been talking about him for a couple of weeks but didn t give any actual details so i assume the deal got pushed through pretty fastGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
Guess we ve exhausted all of our FM targets and now we ve moved onto our FIFA ones
Nah Steve is using an older version of FM
Doumbia was a monster on FM11 Just like Saivet
Saivet was life changing
Incredibly OP
Doumbia turned into a beast on 09 40 goal seasons weren t uncommon
We play Man City in a couple of weeks too good timing
Fuck Knowing luck he will get a last minute winner or hat trick
It s Newcastle They re like our favourite team to play in the league
I can t remember the last time in recent memory that we didn t get thrashed by you lot
Micky mouse cup last season Aarons and sissoko scored
We knocked em out of the League cup a year or two ago 2 0 at the Etihad I think I m still counting that
We beat their first team with a second string in the League Cup last year with Aarons and Sissoko off the bench scoring Fairly sure that was Aarons and Armstrong s first start for us
But it s Doumbia He loves to score on us Unstoppable force and immovable object and all that
A last minuter winner hat trick clawing it back from 0 2 to 3 2 in two minutes of extra time
Good signing who will suit our style of play I d honestly rather just bring a LB in now and forget Berahino at 25m or whatever ridiculous amount WBA want
pls take Saido
why would you want your top scorer for the last 2 years to go
He has no discipline He s fat turns up late and has a shit attitude
You re really selling him for us
pls
It sort of for a little while worked with Ben Arfa
He wasn t fat when he came to Newcastle mind that didn t happen til after he discovered stotties
Wor benny loves his pease puddin
I telt you to wheest I can t hack uppity footwear
Mental you d turn down 21m for a player that barely even gets minutes anymore
We will
Apparently you just bid 24m on Saido
Source
Mirror Nothing else as of yet so I would take it with a pinch of salt
Louise Taylor from the guardian is reporting it and she s reliable
Birmingham Mail saying you ve made an offer between 24 million and 25 million
If WBA hold out over an extra mil then that seems like a big gamble His value come August will be way less
I don t think we re selling him and its not about money
Footballitalia say there are reports
Lol as if icardi would agree to play for newcastle
Might as well since Inter is doing really poorly and he doesn t do well with jovetic
Somehow I don t see barc inter Newcastle as a smart career move
Have to question why you ve been linked with every striker and winger under the sun this window but you haven t brought in any decent defenders That s clearly your worst department but your squad is definitely good enough to stay up now and it would be crazy if you didn t
We ve been linked to kieran Gibbs and Siquera from atletico but both fell through
Much needed right now I think just a fresh set of ideas and a good option with a loan You d be better doing what you suggested though and not taking the gamble for Berahino and making that defence more solid
how about Jose Enrique You can have him for free
we tried
Good From what I ve heard from Roma fans the guys decent but didn t settle at all over in Italy We are in dire need of someone who can finish chances as we are creating them but only Wijnaldum seems capable of actually finishing them off Also Newcastle are going to be much sweatier to play with on Fifa 16 now too
I m going to kill if I read about sweaty FIFA teams one more time
Ibarbo Doumbia and Eminike up front Good god
Musa behind the strikers
Sweet baby Jesus Throw Ramires at CDM set to all out attack and you re ready to roll
Welliton on FIFA 13 never forget
Vagner Love I remember when they first introduced Russian clubs in 12 or 13 and I discovered CSKA Moscow with Love Doumbia and Musa all on the same club
Sadly he s only at 72 Sprint Speed since they re introduced Love to the game when he joined Monaco recently
FUCK OFF
Esswein
FIFA 12 with Esswein and Reus up top It was never fair
Esswein and Arnautovic on FIFA 13 Terrible times
It must be FIFA 13 that I m thinking of I believe this was my team it had 99 chemistry I recall that much http i imgur com KiAyCxu jpg Edit If it wasn t that then I think it was Chiellini to the left Barzagli in the middle and Thiago Silva on the right
RIPinPieces
Emenike isn t on FIFA this year
He s on loan to West Ham I imagine they ll bring him back before the end of the winter upgrades transfer window updates
They don t bring new players into the game and Emenike was never in FIFA 16
What about Kaka He wasn t in FUT15 before he got his OCFC card around this time
OCSC
I think that was because they had a specific agreement with OCSC and NYCFC that the whole team was being brought into the game late
Never said he was in there I just assumed they would add him But another comment was informative enough to tell me why But thanks
They do bring new players
Historically they haven t if they weren t already in the database aka in the game That s for FUT btw I think they do on Head to Head
Oh if you re talking FUT yeah is true Head to head i m pretty sure they do
We re both right excellent
I swear they brought in Paul Scholes to FIFA 12 halfway through the season when he wasn t in the game at the start
They will for H2H Career mode at least
EA claim they can t add new players to the database This applies to ultimate team for a fact
Wow This is all kinds of shitty I don t understand why the Arab world can afford to bribe FIFA but not EA s FIFA
So now The Arab World bribes FIFA That s new
He ll be in seasons but not in FUT
What Never heard this term before now
It s been mentioned in so many threads over the last few days I don t play FIFA myself but as far as I have gathered taking advantage of quick players is considered sweaty
Oh gotcha I haven t been into many of the threads in the last week so I must ve missed them No doubt that won t last long
It s actually been used for 5 years now I think usage of the term is just frowned upon here in r soccer but everywhere else they talk about EA s FIFA you ll see it
I mean I can totally understand it I just somehow hadn t run into the term itself Maybe I m living a sheltered life here in reddit
another annoying part of these comments is the fact that pace hardly means anything in Fifa 16 making sweaty teams useless
Off the ball pace still seems to matter It s on the ball that is fucked
Even then they keep patching it to matter more
You won t hear me complain Means I can play with more physical players better passers and not worry as much about pace whoring
Or you could just defend deep with 5 at the back and deny the pacy players space to run into
Eh I prefer a high defensive work rate on my full backs and CDM in a 4 2 2 Diamond I like having a front D man who will still come somewhat forward and maybe provide some long range shooting
Explains why all the Fifa pro players using PL teams use Kyle Walker Bellerin at RB and Van Aanholt at LB despite them being a lot worse defensively than other players in that position
Kyle Walker is a bit overpowered for his 79 rated card honestly
Walker isnt much worse Hes actually quite strong in game
walcott and bellerin on the right
Newcastle was my fav team to play on PES 8 I dont remember exacly with the combination of S Given O Martins Duff and Viduka Martins was too good that 99 speed and Accelaration was deadly
There s only one S Given one S Given
You guys have done fairly well with African strikers of late Ba Cisse hopefully Doumbia is another Premier League star in the works
Did really well with cisse for half a season Now his positioning and finishing is some of the worst in the league There s a reason we ve stuck with mitro who hasn t exactly been knocking in them in We ll always have that Chelsea goal

Dortmund flair
https www reddit com r NUFC comments 3dtv2d sub swap returning to borussia dortmund still

Are you that Dortmund fan that swapped subreddits with that Newcastle fan a while back
Sweaty in FIFA is when people abuse pace to get easy chances by passing it across goal when 2v1 against the keeper
Wouldn t that just be a good counter attacking tactic rather than particularly cheesy
The problem is that it can be to easy to do that instead of going about other ways
But if you know that they re going to try that then you can counter it surely Sit deeper or be careful with the ball in positions they can get good counters from don t play FIFA but in PES you can usually find a way to deal with things That s probably more in depth than I can justify talking about though given the last one I played a decent amount of was 11
Its fifa mate get the ball and full sprint towards the goal but make sure you get a shot off no matter the distance from goal
You are correct Instructing your defence to sit deeper is an effective counter to pace abusers Pace is a more effective tactic the worse at defending your opponent is
Yeah but PES actually makes an attempt at simulating real football and does so with great success even if the long shots are a bit too easy
it s just people moaning about getting beat it s their own fault for letting them get in that position in the first place
i bet you played ramires at cdm
I m more of a 5 4 1 man
It s considered cheap and easy Essentially because it often requires much less actual ability at the game than other methods of scoring Though this year s game has nerfed it somewhat
Yes but people can t have that They think it s not the classy way to score and dont actually do anything to beat you after that they just blame losing on you being a cheater
I ve heard that being referred to as a Jew goal
Now you know the reason why they like to take their shirts off so much
As a Newcastle fan yes As a general FIFA player no
FIFA 17 might be super depressing if we go down We had such a good team in the end of FIFA 16
Yeah cause Fifa is what will be depressing
To be fair the Championship season was one of about four or five non depressing seasons out of twenty something I ve spent as a Newcastle fan
Finally in a country that can make appropriate use of kumbaya chant potential

He s obviously been poor in Italy but I think he suits the Premier Leagues fast pace to a tee Players like Ighalo etc struggled in Spain and Italy due to the technical slow build up play They seem to thrive in the more fast paced Premier League though
Saying he was poor in Italy is not really fair He was only half a year there right after an injury and played at the Africa Cup part of it as well Plus they played him on a different position
I mean I know it s risky risky business comparing the Swiss and Russian leagues to playing in the PL but in his full seasons with Young Boys and CSKA Moscow he had 111 goals in 159 games If he can get anywhere near that scoring ratio in the PL I would be delighted
He scored loads of goals in CL too He didn t fit for us because he joined us after an injury and at a time when the entire team was playing shitty shitty football Also under Garcia no real striker tended to thrive Doumbia got booed by the fans after only his third appearance Romanista can be very demanding supporters who want instant gratification I think Doumbia has the ability to do well just don t expect him to be a target man just because he s fairly big and strong He s an outright striker who will try to attack space and score goals He lacks severely in his playmaking and passing abilities though so expect that to be a frustration
Italian football and English football are like two different sports as well Interested to see how it works out but I won t be holding my breath
True But Villa are dead and buried Newcastle will make it out if they finish their business quickly
Well we have someone who can score goals now other than Gini so hopefully Plus we spent 100 million this season
Man City fans everywhere shudder
Regarding Doumbia he was mismanaged in Roma and received a hostile welcome by fans which led to this mess of a transfer He had a fantastic scoring record with CSKA both domestically and in Europe The Russian league definitely doesn t like a sexy league to succeed in but it s a very defensive minded low scoring league making Doumbia s record there all the more impressive Doumbia s biggest weakness is his poor injury record and I think that s why some teams have been reluctant to put an offer in His actual age has also been in question I believe
He didn t receive a hostile welcome from the fans They got fed of him real quick but he was welcomed well
Dude we booed him in first game That s everything but a warm welcome
Why exactly was he booed
Lost quite a few balls in possession he s not the type of player that should be involved in build up play and didn t make the best of the couple chances he had on goal So basically he played poorly on his debut but nothing to deserve the boos and jeers he got when he was being subbed off What made everything more ridiculous was that he had just gotten back from playing and winning the entire Africa Cup of Nations and needed more time to rest
Because he is black
He said otherwise
Another signing for the BEAST FC Premier League team
Fucking KSI man
Nah mate that was the old KSI The new KSI only does pack openings and never actually plays Fifa
Old or new KSI he s still not funny
Actually he s been playing lately a new series where if he loses he gives the other guy some money
Yeah that s the Newer KSI The New KSI still doesn t play Fifa
And how is that going for you
about as slow and painful as his videos
Really excited by this Is there any info on whether there s a option to buy
http www nufc co uk articles 20160201 united complete doumbia loan capture 2281670 5315364 Option to make the deal permanent in the summer
and what about a fuckin real LB and someone to cover Colo at CB position
Pocognoli isn t doing much do you want him
IMO Newcastle have had the best transfer window this winter I think it ll give them what they need to stay up and maybe give them a shot at a nice mid table position
It s certainly been active but clearly we needed it
Ive seen lots of newcastle transfer stories on here but not a single villa one are they resigned to their fate at this point
I think they ve been resigned for a while They recently got a new chairman who said spending was not the answer They re done in the PL
Holy fuck thats bad
It s not like he s wrong
I thought they might get some players to prepare for the Championship
Probably better off waiting than paying the inflated jan prices
Fuck He s perfect for the premier league
That s great and the Berahino thing is interesting but I can t imagine our defensive record is far off being the worst in the league over the last 2 seasons and we seem to have forgotten about that
Does anyone know if they have the option to buy or not
I ve heard there is for 7 million But it was just a rumour so make of it what you will
seems like a steal tbh
http www nufc co uk articles 20160201 united complete doumbia loan capture 2281670 5315364 Definitely got the option nothing concrete as to how much
I believe it is but I can t say for certain I ll let you know as soon as I see anything
Is there any info on whether there s a reason only Newcastle Villa were trying to sign Seydou
Ask a Roma fan
Doumbia was quality here at Basel I have no doubts regarding how well he ll perform with Newcastle That guy used to wreck havoc in most defenses and can actually finish
Probably he will play bad in Roma he was awful Doumbia is only good playing for CSKA on Russia not good enough for a top 5 league
Doumbia along with Sissoko are a scary prospect when they re both at it
Been wanting to see him and Ahmed Musa in the PL
All the FIFA players know what s up
great signing for beast fc
The sort of deal Spurs should be doing IMO
Why would Spurs need a player like Doumbia I feel they have a rather balanced squad
They need a forward player desperately and if a permanent solution isn t available until summer a quality temporary one is a very preferable option to nothing
Should have gone back in for Adebayor
No natural backup at striker if something happens to Kane The next best options are Son or Chadli both of which are wingers attacking midfielders
He isn t very good
He was good for CSKA Moscow
Very good finisher Newcastle are in need of someone who can finish his chances they have no problem creating them but only Wijnaldum seems capable of actually finishing them off
Just ripped that off the top comment lmfao
It s the second top comment
I didn t see it
Sturridge Doumbia and Emenike in one league RIP Fifa prepare for the ultimate sweat team

Whatever you did to Coq do it to Yaya
Put him on the bench
End of an era
Too bad that he couldn t outgrow the eredivisie
Our best players always leave too early
Pls do to him what you did to coquelin kthnksbye no take backs if he s shit
Didn t ya like that Twitter guy we sent ya Hehehe
You re in for a treat Charlton fans
By the sounds of it they re already having a ball at the bottom end of the league
Chaos confirmed
Thanks I think I m done with football
He s better than Simon Church who you had on the books for quite some time
At least Simon Church has scored a league goal in the last three years
He scored against Southampton in the cup for us He actually looked quality in that game in my opinion thought he could actually turn out to be a decent player for us based on that game sadly it was the only game where he really showed much quality
Has he ever scored against Dortmund What Sanogo lacks in goals he used to makes up with presence He took Giroud out of the team for a while and changed the FA cup final His time at Ajax though
Sanogo did manage to net 10 times in 13 matches in Ligue 2 before being bought because he s a big presence I know the quality of Ligue 2 is less than the Championship but if Rudy Gestede could put as many in as he did I see no reason why Sanogo can t be an even less coordinated version of that
Maybe We ll have to wait and see
He took Giroud out of the team Uhmmm no
Giroud was benched meaning Sanogo was the better option for a short while
That never occurred Giroud was benched for other reasons like fitness and Sanogo was backup that s why he s backup He was never preferred based on skill
Are we talking about the beginning of last season I think Giroud had a long term injury after the Champs League qualifier against Besiktas which was why Sanogo got the start before we signed Welbeck
Could be I do think Sanogo can be a decent player but I think you re delusional if as an Arsenal fan you ever thought he was higher rated than Giroud
obviously not I was trying to remember why he even started lol He did get that goal in 2 mins vs Dortmund and iirc almost had a second
I can t believe how incompetent your board are Blackpools owners are awful but they are destroying the club on purpose whereas yours are just a bunch of clowns
I think this is part of a long term plan Step 1 Qualify for European football Step 2 Play Benfica Step 3 Chaos ensues
Judging from your response it seems a six month loan actually does qualify as a long term plan for Charlton at the moment
Why Sanogo might not be bad for a club at your level He was almost passable at PL level
Not a massive difference between the Championship and the Premier League
ok buddy
I m sure you watch it all the time The gap is shrinking Look how many clubs come up and stay up comfortably Theres a lot of money in the Championship now The difference is definitely not enough that a player like Sanogo will suddenly become a matchwinner If Middlesbrough come up they ll finish comfortably mid table next year
To be fair you can t compare Middlesbrough to Charlton or most teams in the Championship for that matter Even if the gap is closing I will still say there is a very big difference between the Premier League and the Championship
Yeah just ignore all of my other valid points
No point discussing a league that you dont watch How can I tell you the merits of Bundesliga teams for example if I dont watch it Because a tiny club like Burnley and a basket case like QPR went straight back down you ve decided the Championship is shit Not a lot I can say about that
Because of a short term loan
It says something if Frank de Boer is complaining about the lack of strikers and Ajax is willing to let him go He was terrible for us
He s been injured most of the time tbf
To be fair he s completely dogshit
Couldn t cut is as a starter for the u 21s even when fit
the almighty Sanogoal who started for us against bayern
Actually played well in that game too No matter how shit his career is or could be he will have a few major highlights from that season
That game and goal against Dortmund too
Did well when he came on in the cup final against Hull as well
Gave the ball to Giroud in order for him to assist Ramsey for the winner
did we watch the same game
I was proper impressed
There was no other game to get confused over so we must have I guess your just too blinded by ignorance to realize he played well against Bayern that game That doesn t mean he s an amazing player but you can t take away his good performances despite their rarity
the fuck that came outta nowhere lol gl Yaya and Charlton fans
Poor Charlton
Cmon Yaya fulfill that potential
Holy shit wow God is real
One of the worst players I have ever seen wear the Arsenal shirt Bendtner was world class compared to that Don t think he will cut it at Charlton but hope to be proven wrong
Just because Bendtner became a meme it doesn t mean he was shit He is underrated by most but overrated by himself
have you ever seen Steve Morrow play for the gunners John Jensen Ian Selley a lot of shit players but Ya Ya looks like he is so out of balance and coordination that he has the touch of a baby elephant
Yep takes the cake Gave Benik Afobe never a shot in the first team and got this donkey instead
There s always Park Chu Young
The owners have gone from being incompetent to full on hating the fans
Fans You mean the customers
More like numbers in spreadsheet
That s good if there s one thing we have far too many of it s strikers
Yaya to the rescue
Don t think charlton are in a position to be picky to be honest
Does Jose Riga know who he is
A player who doesn t start for Ajax let alone their youth team in the Jupiler league gets a transfer to Charlton Really doubt he ll do well there I hope for him he makes a change and actually performs
Well looks like South London s going to get chaotic again
South London mercenary No loyalty s
This and we have fanni until summer Best day ever
Sanogo isn t actually that bad a player he wasn t playing all that poorly at the end of the 13 14 season
This fucking guy Impressed against Bayern Dortmund put in a shift as a sub in an F A Cup final but somehow can t hit the ground running while on loan
You can keep him
fucking lol At least they have Millwall to look forward to next season

How to raise a player value by 4M in 6 months without playing him Add FC Porto to his list of clubs
More like premier league club paying on deadline day
Yeah 4 million euros on 20 seems about fair rate particularly for January
This is all Doyen EPL clubs overpay but surely not for a player that doesn t play Doyen was actively trying to find a Club for Imbula
they are just around the corner from me i might see if they can find me a team
No it wasn t We appreciate you trying to devalue the deal though it s always cute This is actually the third bid Stoke makes for Imbula if Doyen had any say in the matter he would have been gone in the first one They helped with financing the deal when he came from Marseille but they don t get to decide if he stays or where he goes It s entirely up to us to accept the bid or not
i think that is a bit naive there is a fair amount of politics going on behind the seens we do not know about I am certain Doyen played a big role in this transfer
They played a role in getting Imbula to come here without their financing we wouldn t be able to afford a 20M value transfer We took all the risk involved in the deal though If we wanted to keep Imbula here we would We d still have to pay whatever fee we borrowed from Doyen in the process but again the decision was always in our hands It was just pointless to keep Imbula here when he has no motivation to play in the Portuguese League And like plenty of people have said around here 6 poor months for us doesn t erase what he did at Marseille And in the grand scheme of things 24M is nothing for a top flight PL club these days
Wasn t there a document revealed that proved Porto only paid 800k of those 20M though I may be wrong but I m pretty sure I remember something like that
Do you seriously believe that Doyen give Porto 10M for Imbula without having a say in his selling
Doyen didn t give us anything We borrowed from them like anyone would do from a bank We d always have to repay those 10M interest regardless if we sold Imbula or not They already made a big profit from our sale of Mangala so they know we re competent and we live up to the end of our bargains It s not like we tried to shaft them with say selling Rojo and trying to not give them anything
Nice bait at the end there mate Good luck with any ensuing hate
Yeah I m obviously on a masterplan to pit Porto supporters against their directors because they have been extremely competent in the last few years I care about titles not transfer fees Couldn t care less I don t like when Benfica does this kind of deals with Mendes Atl tico and I say exactly the same about them If you don t mind Porto being used like this good for you This is the same as Benfica fans being happy with the Roberto deal
Do you know what you re talking about Benfica supposedly made profit on Roberto It s the exact same situation Benfica overpayed for him because Benfica didn t fund the transfer and then whoever put him here overpayed Benfica to get him out of here Roberto and Imbula flopped put Benfica and Porto were only storefronts from them anyway
Nope Benfica never ended up receiving anything for Roberto If you want you can check all your annual reports and try to pinpoint when the 8 6M from his sale came in Hint they never did You did spend 8 5M on his transfer and that money came out though Massive difference He was eventually sold for half the rights of Pizzi
I m absolutely sure it was on the books But you can go check yourself It s not like Benfica could announce the transfer on CMVM and not put it on the annual report Yes everything was diluted into the future deals Pizzi maybe even Jim nez unofficially with Mendes and Atl tico and Benfica never actually received 8 6 million Because that s how it works It s exactly what I m saying for Porto There are a lot more Doyen deals to come for Porto
Like I said you can check it yourself You re the one with doubts not me Those 8 6M never came in They announced those 8 6M to CMVM and redacted it two years later in another document because the entity they sold Roberto to never paid up Then they sold Roberto for half the rights of Pizzi
We did not lost everything in Roberto we get Pizzi on that deal A guy who is being with Mario the best midfielder in the league
Who is then Herrera Where did I criticize the deal Porto did great stoke didn t
Obviously not Herrera I d pick Andr Andr We had months of mediocrity and he was still standing out as our most consistent and top performer And as far as I m aware Pizzi s performances as a midfielder were very criticized Pizzi has been good lately because he was shifted to the wings rather than playing as a midfielder
Don t care if it s a Doyen deal or not But when you sell a shit player for 24M plus 15 in a future transfer that s a great deal
6 months of poor form doesn t make a player shit Otherwise you wouldn t have paid 9M for 50 of Jimenez am I right
He didn t live up to the expectations quite the opposite that s why I said he was shit Maybe one day I ll regret that who knows Jimenez is not playing that bad He fucks up a lot but at least he works hard on the pitch But definitely not worth 9M
IIRC we get a pretty decent percentage of his sale I remember when we sold him there was a bit hope that he would end up going for 40 50m in a few years and we would get a big payday
Its all about Doyen
Porto was doing amazing deals far before Doyen appeared
yeah but this is a negociata da doyen
Maybe but since we payed 10m it s good for us to get rid of him without any losses
10 wasn t it 20
It was reported that porto payed 10m and doyen the other 10
that makes sense It adds to the 20 I thought thank you
So does this mean Doyen will be receiving half of the money
Well I have no idea I know at the time Imbula came to Porto it was reported we only payed 10m But the Doyen beeing involved made the deal really shady At some point they said they didnt payed anything So I dont know Im just happy we got rid of a played with shit attitude that didnt want to be here and that we hardly lost any money with it
yeah i know what you mean Im hoping Sporting can do something similar with Teo Guti rrez
It s not like he didn t play either iirc he played at least 70 of porto games
As much as I love Imbula it makes absolutely no sense that FC Porto is actually making money on him PLUS have a 15 future fee add on I mean c mon I know it s FC Porto but this is just ridiculous
Don t hate the player hate the game
Isn t that how clubs like Porto has been making money the last couple of years as a stepping stone for TPO players I hope those days are over now when TPO is banned by UEFA
They won t stop instead of buying the player directly the TPO s will just loan money to clubs like banks
Well taking loans is one thing but as long as the club and player are free to decide their future it s better
As I said in the other topic Buy player for high fee Plays like shit value decreases Sell at profit add ons WAT According to portuguese press Stoke only wanted a loan but panicked after Charlie Adam came down with an injury
Who the fuck spends 18m because Charlie Adam gets injured
Charlie Adam is a good player don t let the circle jerk tell you otherwise
I don t think anyone really says he s bad he s just a huge cunt
u DorothyJMan just clearly implied he was bad
Did I I thought I implied that spending 18 million simply because a player is out for a few weeks is odd especially given Adam doesn t necessarily even start at Stoke
i mean you even used italics on his name
Yes he definitely did use them
It is odd Its also bollocks
He s a good squad player but he shouldn t be in your Starting XI if you have top 7 ambitions
He s good for a certain purpose and that purpose is coming on with 25 minutes left to let some rockets fly off his left foot and provide some high quality corners and free kicks He s not popular outside Stoke or Blackpool but I value Charlie
He s never shy to an ill advised off balance 37 meter left footed crank
That goes in like a third of the time
He s not popular around civilised places
Charlie Adam is a really consistent player who sometimes puts in wonderstrikes
Hahaha
Thats bollocks we ve been after a transfer all window Adam doesnt even play the same role Imbula is a replacement for Nzonzi
I realize I m repeating something that has been said ad nauseam around here lately but I feel it needs to be repeated in this case Imbula is not a defensive ball recovery player He can help with that but mostly he s a vertical player who takes the ball and runs with it
Thats what we need someone to link the defence and attack Whelan is our ball winner we need someone to sit alongside him and do the technical stuff he cant do Nzonzi wasnt a defensive player for us
Sounds like he s been coached by Redknapp
sell to BPL teams and there will be enough profit
It goes two ways Clubs know BPL teams get a shit ton of money from our TV rights so they change their negotiation tactics accordingly
I imagine Porto fans to be over the moon with this
You have no clue As soon as I read the rumours of it last week I was like Stoke must be seriously stupid He showed no signs of dedication wrath or will to play in our team and in 20 years of FC Porto he s the first play I ever saw giving up in the pitch so often as he did Thank you Stoke
Read the exact same when we signed Arnautovic Bojan and Shaqiri
Hope he does better in Stoke he has a good potential but I ll never forget how disgusting he was playing for us
He was great in Marseille though Maybe he didn t want to be in Porto but was forced by some shady third party ownership I think this could be a fantastic signing by Stoke
Why Is the money going to them
they don t even try to pretend they are actually valuing players anymore Porto was always a stepping stone for Imbula to get into a bigger club and or league He has the talent but plainly did not want to play in Porto No effort whatsoever Him being sold for more than we paid for him is ridiculous
Honestly these are great news for Porto but it s not for monetary reasons since we all know Doyen s involvement in this and how poorly the situation was managed Porto shouldn t be a middleman in these shitty deals the club was always capable to find good talent on its own and get players that really want to play for Porto What is actually important is that Porto offloads a toxic asset who was taking up space in the squad without putting any effort whatsoever and at the same time removes pressure from Peseiro He was always going to be coarced to play Imbula so he could retain his value not to mention the press constantly making a big fuss whenever he wasn t called up This move definitely helps the mood in the locker room which is very important if we want to win anything this year
oh absolutely I am glad he is gone
I would also like to mention how ridiculous it is that some people regard this as a victory and good management on Porto s part
Obviously How can any portuguese write that crap with a straight face It s neg cio Roberto all over again Porto and Benfica don t make profit on these kind of deals But it s easy to fool those who want to be fooled
and even if they made money why would I care Am I supposed to be happy we had someone taking up space in the squad for the promise of a couple of millions for the club fuck that
Are Stoke a bigger club than Porto now
bigger as a club no with more money than us yes
Read again
I will take that as a yes Up the Potters
ONE OF US
ONE OF US
Holy shit another one of us
GOOBLE GOBBLE
You re funny Have an upvote
Well probably since over half of the top 30 in Deloitte Football Money League are clubs from the Premier League today and for the 2016 17 season all 20 Premier League teams will probably be in the top 30 You can piss your pants and it will feel warm for a while with these shady TPO deals but you will probably end up as a washed up hobo
Stoke went from boring to cool so quickly It s unreal
It s refreshing actually
Makes me jelly
Thrilled by this Exactly the kind of player we needed to replace N Zonzi and link the defense and attackers When Porto signed him over the summer everybody was saying he d be a top 10 midfielder in a few years 6 rocky months where he barely played and didn t get along with the club and now this is a bad move for Stoke Please Undeniably talented player with attitude problems who failed to meet expectations at a major club is Mark Hughes bread and butter with us Arnautovic Shaqiri Bojan Afellay etc This kid is only 23 with all the potential in the world Plus 18m is chump change to a billionaire like Peter Coates especially with all the new TV money coming in PL tax etc but honestly these are the kinds of ambitious signings the club has to make if we seriously want to challenge for Europe I for one am fucking psyched
People are shitting all over Stoke for this why Because they maybe have overpaid by a few million Get real They ve been needing to replace N Zonzi since they sold him which I didn t really understand and the guy is clearly talented Stoke have been a great example of how to appropriately build on the fly and have made a number of shrewd and ambitious signings Maybe wait to criticise the move until the guy actually plays poorly With their recent track record they deserve the benefit of the doubt
People are talking like we ve got better CDM s growing on trees or something we ve missed N zonzi massively and we ve tried Cameron Adam Afellay to fill the gap but none have really been able to Afellay and Cameron have done well but it s not their natural position like you ve said N zonzi needed replacing and we re being forced to pay a few million over the odds but that s the January window really
I think people think Nzonzi was a pure defensive midfielder and thats what we re replacing We re missing his ability to link the play more than anything We look better with Afellay in there but too often we ve looked like 6 defenders and 4 attackers this season
his last two or three years he had actually developed his passing and forward play his last season was especially good but commentators and pundits still treated him as if he was still a pure destroyer
I thought Afellay was a creative winger or CAM
He is but he s been playing deeper out of necessity pretty much sums up perfectly why we need an Imbula type player
Absolutely thought MVG would do better
I didn t realize he was pushing to get moved He would be awesome on this team Didn t they only get like 7m for him
Yeah only a year left on his contract Same problem with Begovic and probably Arnautovic this summer
Arnautovic wants to leave He looks great there and w the investment Stoke are making seems like the place to be atm
He s asking for massive wages No sign whether he wants to actually leave but the interest is there
Interesting any idea what constitutes massive and what s your opinion on what he is worth
100k a week was mentioned 60 70k is our wage limit which Shawcross Shaqiri and maybe Crouch are on He s our best player when he s on form but this is the first time in three years where he s performed consistently throughout the season He s worth it on talent you just wonder whether its a risk to give him a big contract then see him slip back into his old ways
Yeah it s too bad Marko sounds like he s demanding more than seems reasonable
In case you were wondering we sold N Zonzi because he d pushing for a move pretty much ever since he joined us all the while running down his contract In the summer it was a case of either cashing in on him or seeing him go on a free as there was no way on God s green earth he was going to sign a contract extension with us
Yeah that makes sense Wonder if he regrets that
Probably I don t think he s made much of an impact there Shame really he was absolutely stellar for us last season
i hated when newcastle had to play against nzonzi post barton nolan days i too was shocked when they sold him off the back of his best season
Pinto da Costa never cease to impress me On the summer he made Real Madrid pay 15m for their own player and now this Just wow
My favorite move of his was The James Moutinho deal and how he got out of giving millions to Sporting It was Pure genius
Better yet that deal ended up being 100 reasonable because James was later on sold to Madrid for an even higher value while Moutinho stagnated So as far as we re concerned nobody got shafted
The national team did
Not really Moutinho has always performed well for the NT even when he wasn t at his best for Monaco He played in almost every game during the qualifiers for the WC and the Euro Also made some decisive performances like the play offs against Sweden
Yea he done some really epic stuff He probablly was the best president in football story It s a shame he getting really old losing his capacitys and like many say true or not losing the club control
Doyen Porto was just a warehouse to store an asset
Porto is a 50 50 share with Doyen They paid 10m in the summer and now they re getting 12
So for all intents and purposes it s a TPO agreement which is illegal
Did you pay Rojo to Doyen yet Pay your debts Sporting
People getting hung on the fee is a bit weird Premier League clubs are loaded we can afford drop 18 million on a high potential player 6 poor months in Portugal doesnt make him shit
Seems way better value then Grabban for 7 million or whatever was paid Anyone who saw him play for Marseille will tell you he has bags of talent maybe the Premier League will suit him better He could play for Stoke for the next decade or so at his age so for me this deal represents pretty decent value Especially as it s being more widely reported it s going to be more like 14 million At the end of the day though I couldn t give much of a shit about the fee it s not my money and under Coates the financial side of the club couldn t be looking healthier I just hope we can get the deal across the line
Yeah we re not going down and the Coates family arent leaving 14 million is nothing in the market at the moment
newcastle have been catching some of the same moaning around here although i think stoke have traditionally payed bigger fees than most midtable clubs after kenwyne jones i say fuck it after seeing top clubs toss around 30 mill mata still hasn t found his place in the team im happy to finally see newcastle bid over 10 mill for a couple players shearer s nominal record has got to be broken soon
Stoke have gotten shafted there
He s not a bad player he just didn t care he can still shine in stoke
He looked a fantastic player prior to Porto I don t think he ever wanted to move there His agent has made a hell of a lot of money in 6 months
Gambling on potential I suppose Porto are hard to deal with and know we have money so it was always going be expensive
I think he s a really talented player who could end up doing extremely well at Stoke Just because he didn t do well in Portugal doesn t change that IMO he s just as good as he was in the summer
We have a tendency to sign people who haven t lived up to their potential and see them improve I m hopeful
Sounds a lot like Sparky s MO too Had David Bentley actually playing like Beckham s heir apparent all those years back
I m not sure Bentley counts as Blackburn paid good money for him and he was always a very talented player It was what happened after Blackburn which was the problem Spurs have that effect
My thoughts exactly I m actually sad that he didn t fit into the club because he s shown albeit in very few examples that he has huge potential He was great vs Chelsea in the first match But mentally he s not there I don t know if he doesn t give a damn or if he didn t fit the team s playstyle
How so Did you even watch him last season He s an incredible player he s one of the most arrogant players I ve seen though But I d rather spend 24m on Imbula than 10 15m on the Ligue 1 players the other PL clubs are buying
An upgrade on Nzonzi in both talent and arrogance then I wouldnt have thought it possible
Not really he s the player we ve been missing since N Zonzi left and he s got arguably a higher ceiling than N Zonzi who was one of our key players
Imagine Imbula tried and cared to be at Porto We d have sold him for 35
He would have to actually want to improve here which he doesn t
Massive risk here buckets of potential but a shit attitude hopefully he ll be another bad guy gone good under Hughes Not liking this signing at all though
Not seeing the risk People still haven t adjusted to the fact that 20 million is absolutely nothing now for a stable Premier League club
It s not nothing at all clubs have more money but to say it is nothing is just naive
Obviously it s not nothing but it s not that big a risk If he doesn t work out they ll sell him on If they lose 10 million it won t affect them in any meaningful way
10 million is still a huge amount
Not really Like I said people still haven t adjusted to the new market With the new TV deal 10 million isn t near what it once was
Even with the tv deal that people think of so highly 10 million is HUGE especially for teams like stoke not saying stoke is bad I don t think their transfer budget will be over 40 mil
Arnautovic too
What s wrong with Shaqiri s attitude He s got a good one
Let s hope he can adapt there cause he wasn t anywhere near worth the fees being paid for him
Has he been that bad for Porto When we were linked in the summer I was disappointed we had missed out on him
He was fantastic against Chelsea in the Champions League Aaaand that s pretty much all we saw from Imbula He had no intention or desire of playing for us
He did a couple of good runs in some games apart from that a huge disappointment
classic porto income generation
The guy has been playing shit but he has talent he just didn t want to play in Portugal This is a cheap deal really
Thanks Stoke You just made a friend Anyway he can be really useful to Stoke
All this new TV money has opened up the PL like nothing I ve ever seen Stoke kitted out with Bojan Shaquiri Aunautovic and now Imbula I love it
deleted
It s no different to how clubs usually run their transfers though Shawcross was a failed player from United and Adam failed at Liverpool littered throughout the PL you will find Manchester United rejects let alone the other top clubs
what a deal by porto as always They get rid of a player that didnt adapt make a profit and now there s more space for Ruben Neves
THANK YOU
I think he s a really consistent player who takes the ball and runs with it
So Porto makes a profit somehow Wow
It s really hard to hate Stoke as much as I should we are just light years apart now so there s zero rivalry They are really lucky to have an owner like Coates
You should stop by the ground one Saturday afternoon See how it feels
If this is true then it s absolutely hilarious Silly Stoke
I mean he s gotta be better than Whelan and Adam at least right
Whelan is great
Whelan is underrated
Whelan is unfashionable but he never puts a foot wrong Affelay does the job but he is a stop gap measure because of the lack of creativity in our midfield but he s not a true CM or even the player we need I can t say I know anything about Imbula but we need somebody who can move the ball out and transition defence into attack like N Zonzi used to without pinging 40 yard balls that don t go anywhere I hope Imbula can be that player
As everyone is saying Whelan has been good but recently they have been playing one proper midfielder him Afellay playing next to him Stoke would of course benefit from having a real midfielder next to him
Afellay has been very good in that CM role
Afellay is our best CM He uses the ball brilliantly
What s wrong with Afellay He s not a winger anymore legs are too shot for it
Great deal by Porto and a dumb move by Stoke for that price That s what you get when a entire league as more money than the other ones combine in Europe When you have more money than you can spend you usually will buy high Like Chelsea in the yearly Abramovic years or City now Imbula is not a shit player but he is nowhere worth all that money This is a guy who 3 coaches tough was worst than Herrera the worst player in the starting 11 there must be something wrong with him He is a great athlete and has some skill but his passing is seriously lacking for a midfielder For that money they could probably get Jo o Mario from Sporting who is much better
I m quite fine with players in bad form coming to us especially at gus age Hughes has shown he can get guys back in form and playing to their strengths Coates and Hughes have been fiscally prudent to this point and this would still leave our net spend less than 30 million
wow how can we still have profit on this guy thanks Stoke
Wouldn t be Stoke without a deadline day signing
Time to get your Belgian passport to succeed in the EPL Ganielli
Specially from a club that took so long to pay the expenses we had missed out on him
Imbula has only played in half of Porto s league games and they re going to turn on a profit on him and get a sell on fee That s ridiculous Well done by PDC
Porto have always been good at selling players
Very good signing by Stoke They ve certainly changed my impression of them this season both on and off the pitch Hope they qualify to the Europa League
Good for us I have to wonder though considering Imbulas work ethic wouldn t a youth player been just as riskier albeit cheaper
This is hilarious Wasn t this guy playing like dogshit lol The business wizardry of Porto never ceases to amaze me
CAN T BELIEVE WE LL MAKE A PROFIT AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Thank God Imbula have no brain
no effort
Mercenary
Hughes getting closer and closer to a bid for Balotelli he loves the challenge of fixing lazy underachieving players
Congratulations you played yourself
ahah stoke you dumb fucks
Who knows if this is a good deal for Porto or Stoke No one knows how much Porto actually spent on him or how much they will actually get for him Stoke spending this much is still ridiculous though whoever the money ends up going toGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
Would be a top class signing for Palace no doubt Don t think terry would go though for two reasons He would get far more money from MLS or China or some such Don t think he would go to a team that would play against Chelsea
Yeah he specifically said he won t play in the Prem No chance
That s what Lampard said And Fabregas
Lampard had already played for West Ham though
john terry played for Nottingham forest
On loan
In the old First Division not the Premier League
While you re right generally in England the old First Division refers to the Premier League i e the top tier of English football before 1992
Lampard had no choice Fabregas is not traditionally known as a man of his word
no choice you think he would sign a long term contract without asking questions and finding out he would be playing for man city he s not an idiot
I don t think he knew he d be loaned to a premier league club considering David Villa was in a very similar situation and was loaned to Australia
Haha you re acting as if he had no choice
He could ve refused the move meaning he literally had a choice
Also Fabregas said he wouldn t leave Arsenal for another prem team He didn t He left Arsenal for Barcelona He never said he d never play for another prem side
He did He said he couldn t see himself playing for another prem club
To be fair that doesn t mean he won t either it just means he couldn t imagine it at the time For example I can t see myself playing for a premier league team but that doesn t mean I would turn down the offer
And how did he choose a side in direct conflict with Chelsea He chose to play for an MLS club
You think he was unaware he was going to be loaned to City Lets not be naive here bruh
I m not sure how it really all worked but fairly sure Lampard wasn t at Man City on loan
I legitimately think he thought he d be loaned to Australia
he signed his contract with manchester city
John Terry is on a whole different level to even Lampard not to mention Lampard didn t have much control of the situation
It s weird how China has suddenly become a new possibility for Premier League players
not new dario conca was the highest paid player in the world for a short while in 2011 or 2010 drogba moved there in 2012 or 13
Yeah but the hype has increased significantly over the past year or so
true theres enough people over there if even 1 100th are fans that can afford shirts tickets the clubs should have plenty of money to splash
That partnership of Terry and Dann could well be the slowest defensive pairing in history
Dann isn t even that slow It s when he gets injured and we have to deploy the dreaded partnership of Terry and Hangeland that things get really interesting
Combined age of 70 that football experience tho you just can t train that mate
Scott Dann is 28
but Hangeland isn t
Ah right wrong end of the stick there d oh
Yeah and John Terry is 42 idiot
Brede knows his roots he d break Terry s legs
Brede is tough and all but in a fight against pretty much anyone I d bet on Terry That dude is made of stern stuff Brede would break first
Hangeland lifted up a referee before Hangeland may look lanky but he s pure Norwegian muscle and would crush Terry under his size 17 boots and 9 foot legs
Terry just picks up a lot of women
Cheeky
Terry has this look of grit on him My dad once told me that young guys they ll hurt you Old guys though they ll kill you
But what about dazzling Damien Delaney Actually on a serious note have his performances dropped off somewhat this season after his heroics last campaign Seems that way to me but I don t watch Palace regularly I mean in essence he s a 34 year old Championship defender who inexplicably decided to peak at 33 for some reason
Damo s been as solid as ever Love that man Still not quite sure why he suddenly decided to go from a Football League journeyman to Premier League veteran defensive stalwart but I am not complaining
Well that s terrific Probably been the best Irish centre half form wise over the past year or two pity he was frozen out by O Neil because of his age But yet Damo never complained Top pro He s a terrific captain for you lot too in the absence of Jedinak
Absolutely he s a cracking example of what you can do if you put your head down and work hard regardless of the state of your career He s very well liked down in South London
Does fifa say he is That s probably why that comment was posted
Don t get me wrong big Scotty Dann is hardly a pace merchant I just thought it was an odd choice given he s probably the quickest centre back we have Brede Hangeland has the acceleration of an ocean liner
Can t wait for those headlines Slower Than Evolution Slow and Slower Even at twice their current speed they d still be twice as slow as slow itself
That last one is a bit of a mouthful for a headline
I imagined it as more of an undertitle
Did you never watch QPR
Rio and Dunne for sure
O Shea and Brown
deleted
what the fuck is all this
sorry accidental copy n paste
lol it s fine just confused the shit out of me
what the fuck is this
sorry accidental copy n paste
It s okay I forgive you
He s already scored one goal for Palace
thats one more than Palace strikers have scored this season
Hey now Wickham scored a penalty kick So equal to the amount that our shit strikers have scored this season
No it isn t It s exactly equal Come on mate if you re going to banter off the state of our strikers which low hanging fruit notwithstanding they probably deserve at least get it right EDIT And I forgot Dwight Gayle s been banging them in in the cups This one s just a right mare all round
Terry and Pards would be the most repulsively English duo in the football league Just imagine that smug Pardew grin coupled with the cheeky John Terry smile in press conferences and post match interviews where they ve just nicked you 1 0 in the 87th minute Now imagine being relegated by that
Partucarly if that 1 goal is an offside back heel
Sorry Pards No I couldn t do that to the Chelsea fans I couldn t play for another Premier League club It will be elsewhere for sure I don t know where and I leave that to the people in charge It certainly won t be in the Premier League
Is that quote from Terry or Lampard
Pretty sure it was Sol Campbell
ffs now i m angry again
Lmao Take your upvote you prick
FUCK YOU LMAO
Lol
Terry Lampard played for West Ham as well as Chelsea you know
Lampard didn t have much of a choice He signed up for NYCFC and then they loaned him out to City Nice try though
http www theguardian com football 2015 jan 09 manchester city error frank lampard new york city fc deal
Terry could help Crystal Palace win the league just like Lampard with Man City
Not worth it
he wouldnt betray the chelsea fans but he would betray his wife cunt
found Terry s wife
haha banter
When did he actually say this quote though Also it could be possible he s mainly referencing the likes of Arsenal Liverpool etc If it s a few years old then he could ve changed his mind after seeing how the fans have treated Lampard and Cech after they played for other premier league teams Personally I would love to see JT play at the bridge at least one more time after this season even if he was on the other team As long as it s not fucking Spurs Arsenal Liverpool or West Ham
It s from his statement released yesterday
Ah ok fair enough that s 2 3 minutes of typing that response that I ll never get back
youd be fine with him playing for a manchester club
Don t come here for the full picture
Terry already said he won t play for another Premier League club
He probably also made a few promises in his marriage vows
Oh no don t bad mouth ERJT
Isn t it EBJT
lmao of course he will
And now I m sad
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA PARDEW Like that is gonna happen
Don t think he would want to play in the Championship
Which is why he hasn t gone to Newcastle already
No thanks John Terry is a repulsive human being I don t care if he d improve our team I don t want him anywhere near my club Edit For those downvoting kindly remember that John Terry is a racist who had an affair with and eventually impregnated his teammates wife His dad is a drug dealer and his mother is a thief The guy is pure scum
Why would he ever want to go to a shit club like Crystal Palace though anyway Forgetting to ask the important questions
Perhaps he d like to experience an atmosphere at home games
The fact that you actually think Terry is a racist makes me not want to even respond to you anymore It s just delusional at this point
Nothing better than responding to someone just to let them know how much you re not going to respond to them
You have a point haha But I was more referring to continuing with the argument than the act of writing another comment
Calling someone a black cunt is a pretty strong indication of that person being racist From my personal perspective
He was cleared of it in court And besides that no one on the internet actually knows what being an actual racist is It means that you think one race is superior to another If Terry did call him that then he did a really shitty thing but if he was an actual racist then he would think all black people are beneath him You really think Drogba would associate himself with someone like that Yeah I doubt it
Ah yes please teach us your wisdom The whole internet doesn t know what a racist is but you do There is no chance that your opinion on whether Terry is a racist couldn t be the slightest bit bias I mean there is so much more subtlety to the question of racism than you want to admit Unless you think all black people are beneath you you cant possibly be a racist thats incredibly naive I dont have much of an opinion on JT himself but he was cleared of it in court is also disingenuous Being racist isn t a crime so he cant have been cleared of it in court He was cleared of racial abuse but not of being a racist Important distinction unless you think you can only be racist with a criminal conviction for racial abuse
He admitted in court to calling him a black cunt I know what being a racist actually is I ve lived with one and I can tell you they have to keep their opinions under wraps quite a bit but if you spend time with someone like that they let things slip This was an example of Terry letting something slip I ve also played football for a number of sunday league teams and I ve heard my fair share of racism in them I m happy for him to be the bigger man and not come up with scummy excuses like I was being sarcastic Make amends for his err but he didn t Unfortunately you re seeing what you want to see my friend it s no surprise that your club s own Kick it Out ambassador did not sign the letter of support that was organized by your club backing up Terry In fact several of the black players in the club didn t He called him a black cunt admitted it in court and got off it as he had an expensive lawyer who managed to wrangle him a sarcasm defense
Dude he s not a racist he said black cunt yeah it s fucked up and unexceptable but it s not overly racist it s not Luis Suarez bad it was in the heat of the moment on a one off he made a mistake big fucking deal People act like you re all perfect and 100 politically correct it s a joke
It definitely is very racist By associating the worst word possible and black together it s very very racist Put yourselves in the shoes of a black guy how you d feel if someone said that about your skin colour you white cunt or whatever your skin colour is You re the odd one out and he specifically chose your skin colour to say next to the insult It s racist and it s why he can t represent the nation any longer He didn t amend for what he did he tried to deny it making his actions even worse
I d have to disagree and fucking hate racism I really do but I think he got all that shit because he was John terry rather than he was a racist if you know what I mean
Regarding the affair this is the statement the newspaper issued a few days after breaking the story On January 31 and afterwards we published some personal information about Vanessa Perroncel in articles concerning an alleged affair with the footballer John Terry Miss Perroncel has since informed us that she would have preferred her personal information to remain private and it was untrue in any case We apologise to Miss Perroncel for any distress caused
Scum
Why insult him for who his family are That just says he had a tough upbringing Sure he s racist but his upbringing shouldn t cause you to dislike the guy
I don t think palace will have the same allure for Terry that City did for Lampard There s only really the two domestic two trophies palace can play for whereas City gave Lampard the chance to win another title Also Whichever MLS team that Terry gets signed up to is unlikely to have a relationship to Palace
I hope that LCFC arent a fluke this year and that the huge influx of cash allows midtable teams to challenge for the title more often Theres talent to be found abroad for what even relegation clubs can afford just has to be spent wisely
And he will say no How about Pardew to Chelsea
New Castle are you listening am giggling at the sight of it dunno why
There is a grim amount of wrong in this comment

It s only a 2 hour drive mate
Only an an hour twenty on the train Someone get him a ticket
Only a 10 hour bike ride He could probably use the exercise anyway
I think if he manages to cycle there before the deadline a medical isn t really necessary
I disagree If he manages to cycle 117 miles in what two and a bit hours I think he ll need rather more than just a medical New hamstrings for one
Or a doping test
because he took a pitstop at Ferdinans house
Better still somebody call Odemwingie he ll have him there in an hour tops
You have never used a British train right
sadly too often Once got stuck on a German train for two hours too Talk of efficiency and all that
I am pretty sure there is no word for efficiency in Berlin It simply does not exist

Maybe he just loves curry and there are some great Indian s in Leicester
Extreme weather prevented us from signing Lewandowski a few years ago Fuck Iceland
Oops
Wow man that sucks I really feel you
T is better to have Lewandowskid and lost than to have never Lewandowskid at all
I hate Iceland
your version of basketball reasons
Please don t make me remember the CP3 trade
That s why when you have a whole month to get shit done you don t leave it until the last few hours
You obviously haven t seen my university coursework
Nobody has Not even your lecturer
You can get crazy money on the last day though It s in Chelsea s interest to reject any offer until the last minute
Normally yes but I think if Chelsea had offered Remy out for 10 5m earlier there d be a few takers
someone please tell Steve Parish this
Always amazes me how last minute multi million dollars clubs leave these deals
We signed a CB two minutes before the window transfer closed today
Tbf we only found out Javi was injured yesterday so we did very well to sign a player that quickly
Surely a medical can take place elsewhere Is this just a lame excuse
It can take place at any reliable doctor Remember zil If Arsenal were fine with MW report Leicester should be fine with whatever doctor is left in London
He failed the medical at Liverpool so there could be concerns from LCFC to rely on another doctor Not that I agree but just saying
The wind s having a stormer out there blocking deals all over the place
Maybe you all can sign the wind as a Tim Howard replacement
Would definitely be better in the air than old Timmy
I thought you meant Tim Sherwood signing the wind
Agents hate it
Seems like a shitty excuse really Aren t clubs allowed a little extra time to finish deals if they contact the FA before hand
I mean if he s stuck for a place to go we re only a very short drive away
I ll drop by and pick him up myself
I suppose it would be old fashioned to just drive there
This would be an absolute scandal if they blocked this move after the Arshavin fiasco seven years ago
Arshavin fiasco I tried googling
He joined Arsenal several days after the window closed due to bad weather despite being spotted at their training ground in the first week of January
Send him via fax 3
I hope it goes through Remy really deserved to be in a team that is challenging for a top four spot this season
Fuck you I laughed
Well never heard or thought about something like this That sucks
Didn t lewa or someone miss a medical because of the Icelandic volcano eruption
Would have been a Blackburn legend if not for the volcanic ash
The did the same thing with Nathan Dyer from what I heard on sky
How have Leicester managed to not sign a striker this window
Take the train
You ever took a British train
Even on his wages I bet the train is too fucking expensive
Bloody Henry stirring things up only in Britain
I bet Klopp is hating this weather right now Sticking pins in a doll that looks like wind
Id imagine cars trains boats exist in England
Get Owen and his heli
Can t he do a medical in London
They can apply for an extension if the paperwork is already in motion and both teams agree cant they It happend with welbeck to arsenal
Arshavin to Arsenal as well
Drive then
Oh for fuck s sake
Fine by me Hopefully Falcao s return to Atletico comes off meaning we ve basically just replaced him with Pato
Gertrude is it
Yes also his grand mother died for the third time this morning
I know im going to sound like an over reaction but this was such a great opportunity to give the lads some backup and provide us with a striker who could potentially score improve for us we re bidding 20M for a striker in CSKA surely in the whole of europe there is a striker of a quality that warrants a similar price and we could of gone for him instead of trying to not pay 23M for Musa the whole window I dont understand it if we dont make champions league because the goals dry up or Vardy Oka Ulloa get injured we have no one to blame but ourselves So frustrated

Very Pozzling
Seems like a Pozzi scheme
pozzotively brilliant pun brother
I didn t know such transfers were pozzoble
Very cringeworthy pun
But isn t that how a lot of their transfer deals work It s not uncommon for an owner of different clubs to have their transfers linked to each other Just look at Charlton and Standard Liege
They use this more than they probably should I can t for the life of me find it but I remember someone saying that they once signed a player for Udinese and he then spent five consecutive years loaned to Granada
The best case was definitely when Watford managed to re loan a player to a different team that they only had on loan themselves
Mujangi Bia what a terrible player
Steve Leo Beleck too straight to Stevenage
Oh wait that s who I meant not Mujangi Bia both completely forgettable players to be fair to me
It was Beleck wasn t it
Was it Ighalo I know he spent a while on loan at Granada
I think that was Nyom
Ighalo too
Igahlo s story at Watford is entertaining He was loaned to us for a year from Udinese 3 months in we decide we want him properly We cancel his loan and Udinese release him from his contract and we sign him permanently essentially as a free agent This all happened within 24 hours
Hey does anyone here know who owns Watford Granada and Udinese
Some Italian family but I m not pozzotive on the name
He looks impressive Loads of potential Touted as the best prospect out of South America since Messi Lets hope he lives up to that
Pozzo knows what he s doing Udinese always acquire young foreign talent know how to sell
it s a family not one person btw
They join like Voltron for the transfer board
Pozzo s unite
Giampaolo owns Udinese Granada his son owns Watford I was only speaking about Giampaolo Giampaolo knows what he s doing it s too early to see if his son does
seems like he s doing better than his dad
Absolutely not His dad runs his clubs like a business Results don t matter it s all about getting as much money as possible for players The club is there to make money for him
Gino has kept everything good about the club and made better what wasn t still family oriented keeps the history of the club intact names stands after people that have done miracles for the club before him obviously at the bottom of it all it is a business but he seems to be doing his bit for the fans also
And with investments into the Vic for renovation As a Hornet I m very happy with our owners
They did downgrade the youth academy to save a few quid which ruffled some feathers a few years back
Sure but they upgraded it again Was downgraded because we couldn t afford it sort the club out make it debt free and reinvest again
Right didn t hear they d upgraded since Good to hear they put the money back in
it s also a person though
They re more like Legion from Mass Effect
It s more of a they know what they re doing Giampaolo runs the Udinese operation and his son Gino is heavily involved with Watford
I was referring solely to Giampaolo he s at it long enough that I can claim he knows what he s doing Gino hasn t been there long enough for me to say the same about him
Ah I get ya It s clear that Giampaolo is massively helping out Gino with his experience but I do think Gino is doing a fine job at Watford
I get it they fucking own all 3 clubs
Pozzo3
Seeing as he s from Venezuela they probably want him to get an EU passport whilst the transfer allows for some creative accounting
Apparently it s to get round his 20 million euro release clause
This type of multi club ownership should be banned not a fan
Not seen all this criticism about our methods for a few years How exciting
Pozzotive news for Watford fans
Hm I sense a theme with all these clubs
Yeah they all play football
I m gonna assume the Pozzo family are pretty stacked
Not really No one really knows but it s estimated the family as a whole values around the 1 billion mark
TL DR Pozzo
Something seems to be repeated I wonder what it could be
Pozzo is love Pozzo is life
if we changed Pozzo to Pollo s would be like managing different fast food restaurants Experience
That s some good detective work
Well atleast he will remain in Granada for the rest of the season
I think I miss a Pozzo family reference on the title anyone else
Someone get the list xDDDdDdd
Ironic shitposting is still shitposting
Oh no my stellar reputation might be in ruins
Sounds like money laundering
Embarrassing way to run a club
Works pretty well for us
No you don t understand the American Man United fan doesn t approve
those bloody ponzos
Its a Ponzo scheme
Hey if the Glazers can suit Rooney up in a Tampa Bay Bucs uniform it s fine by me
Explain why And make sure you focus on why it s embarrassing Why should I feel embarrassed as a fan of the club
Breaking the British transfer record to then make a 12 million pound loss selling to another elite European side within 12 months is a far better way to run a club to be fair
Because teams like Granada become feeder clubs to you it takes away a clubs identity I really dislike how the Pozzos run your club
But they are 3 top flight sides in 3 of the big 6 European leagues It s not like they re league 2 sides who have sold their soul and it isn t all one sided If Grenada were relegated the family would focus on getting them back in la Liga It s an equal partnership although they are focusing on Watford at the moment to establish us in the top flight with the money coming in Once we re set up as solidly as Udinese they ll look at Grenada
Ha ha NYCFC and Man City anyone
No not at all NYCFC is a brand Udinese Watford and Grenada are three solid top flight teams of the major European leagues
I just dislike that certain clubs are seen as priority over other clubs like toys Watford is the favourite club now so Granada will be your feeder club
Haven t you spent around 30m this season to miss out on promotion again
We aren t talking about Derby though

DOOMbia
Shame Adam Armageddon is out on loan
I m surprised NUFC havent tried to make Toonbia a thing
Doom Bar Eh
As someone who barely watches much football other than the Prem can someone tell us if he s any good FIFA bellends need not respond
Scored 50 goals in 64 for Young Boys 61 goals in 95 for CSKA then went to Roma last January and has stagnated since then I ve read he loves a dribble takes the defender on but is shite in the air
He s scored a good number of goals for CSKA in the Champions league so that s good
he is surprisingly high up on a list of goals per game in the champions league this is top goals per game throughout the history of the competition 0 97 Gerd M ller Bayern M nchen 34 goals in 35 games 0 86 Jos Altafini Milan Juventus 24 goals in 28 games 0 85 Ferenc Pusk s Budapest Honv d Real Madrid 35 goals in 41 games 0 84 Alfredo Di St fano Real Madrid 49 goals in 58 games 0 82 Jos guas Benfica 18 goals in 22 games 0 80 Seydou Doumbia CSKA Moskva 16 goals in 20 games
That s pretty exalted company Clearly he likes a big game
They ve obviously just tried to bring in someone who might turn up in the derby
Shola mk 2
The Mackem Slayer
I ve always been a fan of him since he s been at CSKA This was something I enjoyed when CSKA played Bayern Hope he does well in the Prem
Fair play sounds like a decent punt for the Geordies in that case
5 assists and 5 goals in 11 games and 2 sub games for CSKA That s not terrible Not his usual level but not stagnation I think
Ask Manchester City fans
http i imgur com 9VHwq20 gif
I watched him and Musa against us twice in the champions league recently he wasn t anything special fast but easy to win the ball off Runs in behind well and he s good on the counter but often misplaces passes when he s trying to link up
opinion on Musa
He is the better of the two that is for sure
He was more dangerous than Doumbia imo more creative and not just a speed merchant there was one moment where Musa slipped Doumbia through on goal and then made a good run for the return ball but Doumbia shot and de Gea saved it He s not very big though so sometimes gets muscled off the ball easily
better and younger
He got dat 91 pace going for him
He tore our defence to shreds in the CL last year was driving at the defence every time he picked up the ball though if i recall correctly Demichelis was playing in our games against Roma and he can tend to make attackers look faster better than they are
why would you need to ask anyone who s actually seen him when you ve got the BBC s Football Manager expert giving his opinions on their scroller
Has bundles of pace but weak in air
This is going to be a hell of a relegation battle You lot are looking good and I m pretty happy with our signings as well
Regardless of who we buy I m still genuinely worried whenever we get a decent result or two it seems those around us also get one and we re no better off
Well if you get two and they get one you re better off clever winking emoji
And I m happy with ours
Meanwhile we have nary a signing
Newcastle sign French speaking black guy what a surprise
Well we have been trying french speaking white guys but they don t seem to work out as well
H now it could have a Dutch speaking insert race guy
Fuck me Newcastle are trying to create Belgium
I heard Manchester have a perfect player he fills all the criteria Speaks French at least some Dutch is both a white and a black guy and already used to saying I m playing for United
Wow can t believe their attacking half is so good and yet they are struggling
Because their defence isn t very good
Only 12 conceded in the last 10 games which is good for us Our problem recently is that we haven t been putting away simple chances We could ve beaten every team from those last 10 games if Mitrovic Sissoko De Jong could finish
41 all season which is 3rd or 4th most though
I know we were poor before the carefully selected last 10 games Lost 5 1 to Palace in the 11th We ve been playing much better recently although the last game against Watford definitely feels like we may be reverting to poor form once again
Didn t Tufty say it was a tremendous performance against Watford It ll definitely be an exciting relegation battle we ve both strengthened our teams
I m looking at who I think will get relegated I think Norwich has potentially the weakest team on paper not including Villa as do Bournemouth but both have a good young manager MacClaren just isn t getting the results but we are playing infinitely better than we did under Pardew Tricky situation
I d agree with you on Norwich Problem with having a young manager is that they are probably inexperienced especially at this level Someone always gets sucked in I thought it might be Southampton but their results have picked up West Brom Swansea are still not safe and Swansea have only signed one player The Pulis Factor is huge though
Have you watched any of our matches
Yes quite a few
Emenike and Doumbia in the prem What is this world coming to
End but for other reasons
You left the oven on didn t you
my thoughts completely I m not sure I can cope
I hope he will deliver as Wijnaldum did I really like to see Newcastle getting stronger
Me too me too
L1 Triangle
LB Y
Hopefully he does well and knocks in a few goals At least we re trying D
FUT ULTIMATE CUNT
looks much older than 28 haha
He s scored a good run for the Geordies in that case
I could see him making fantastic performances at Newcastle He could be the key to relegation safety I really hope he does well
http youtu be eO696B03l48
Don t hear much Ashley Out shite lately
And now Newcastle just need Ibarbo Ez wins Edit Whoa so much salt
deleted
Emenike and Doumbia upfront I can smell the fear already
I can t Emenike isn t in FUT Edit Why the downvotes I m stating a fact you fucking mongs
Just signed with West Ham
I know but he s still not in FUT
don t players don t get winter transfers if they re not in the game in the first place
They get added into career mode and seasons I believe but they don t get an Ultimate Team card
Ah fair cheers for clearing that up
FIFA will never be the same again
FIFA 12 Legend
Bloody hell why does r soccer hate FIFA so much
Because no one gives a fuck about your ultimate team or ratings or how fast he is in Fifa or whether KSI strokes his dick over him It s not relevant and it s more suited to a gaming sub Like me talking about guitar hero in a guitar sub
with this being said I d like to add on that no one gives a fuck about your fantasy football team either
Well if we going into this Or whether he was is a fucking FM wonderkid
It s weird how FIFA gets so much hate but FM is upvoted
Because FIFA if for casuals that actually enjoying their games instead of us glorious FM master race that would play Reading A Book The Game s
Well said It really irritates me that people base their opinions of real players on FIFA versions of that player Like people claiming that Giroud is shit because he isn t fast laughable really
I don t think I have ever seen a post upvoted on here that Giroud is shit because he s slow
Not this year because goals speak for themselves On r gunners there certainly were elements last year that would rather have had Wele or Theo up front purely due to their pace
Against some teams I agree it s sensible though they can play 2 distinct strikers and I think that adds to their results Edit should say distinctly different strikers
We never play 2 distinct strikers in the traditional sense but we also don t play with 2 wingers that stay wide When Alexis plays he s normally in the box same with Theo Usually they are balanced out by having a playmaker wide like Campbell Ox or Ramsey
Sorry I didn t express myself clearly didn t mean they can play 2 strikers intended to say that the have 2 distinctly different strikers that they can play according to the situation
this argument only exists in your mind also giroud is slow IRL and Fifa
Surely we can both agree that for a long long time there were ALOT of people that were saying Giroud was shit I definitely have heard some people claim it was due to his lack of pace
I don t see what that has to do with FIFA He is slow I m a big Giroud critic he was criticized more for his complete inability to finish in general and his Houdini acts in big matches He s improved upon both this year
I feel as though criticism of players simply for their lack of pace comes from FUT players that have no concept how important it is in the modern game Those that think pace is the only valuable asset and a player s worth is derived from how quick they are Perhaps I m wrong it s hard to tell where people are coming from when they criticise players I agree that he has stepped up in big games this season for sure as we saw with 2 against liverpool hattrick against Olympiakos etc
sure but his inability to beat defenders with pace definitely holds him back yeah you can still be a good player without it But he s definitely poor against teams we counterattack Before theo got injured watching him ozil and alexis run circles around United was amazing Pace isn t crucial its an added bonus But there s a reason all the best attackers in the world have pace
In all fairness r guitar is absolute shite and would probably be improved if it allowed Guitar Hero content
Because it has nothing to do with real football in terms of tactics play ecc and it isn t even the best football related videogame It s annoying to see so many people taking a videogame seriously it s something to be taken for fun
Maybe because its entirely fucking irrelevant to real football The stats aren t realistic in many cases and comparisons are entirely pointless
Actually the stats are pretty well made
If you compare the stats year on year the absolutely gigantic increases or decreases in stats over a short period of time shows how inaccurate it can be
That videogame doesn t have a lot to do with actual football

R A R E B A A U E R A R E B A A U E R
People are gonna piss and moan but i think the board knows what they are doing and we need some more fit CBs
People who piss and moan don t have any clue He used to be one of the best CBs in the Bundesliga and should be still solid now He is the best we can get right now and will help us And with him being on a loan there is absolutely no risk Great job by our board
I think they are right to Tasci has been very very mediocre in Russia I understand the club will hope he can return to the form he had in the past but its going to be a big step up and on his recent form I would absolutely love to see him line up against Juve
I don t think he will play much CL
Ye I figure he ll be there in the league to ensure your better centre backs are fit for the champions league but I can hope
It s gonna be hard enough for us anyway Got a really bad feeling about it
He doesnt have to honestly I think people are blowing this transfer waaaay out of proportion Tasci will play in the Bundesliga and will still be behind Badstuber and obviously Javi after he returns in a couple of weeks Tasci will merely be a emergency solution in case yet another CB gets injured or needs to rest in a less important Bundesliga match and if he plays well the board will sign him Its not like the board loaned him to be a long term investment
I think it s because his last season with Stuttgart wasn t very good and people view Russia as a place where European players careers go to die Not a lot of people will have seen him play in Russia so the last thing they remember is his mediocre season with Stuttgart But I trust the board and he s still going to be a backup so I don t have a problem with the signing It s not like we should be expecting him to come in and be the best CB in the league we just need someone solid who has played CB in the Bundesliga and can follow instructions
We reportedly scout emergency signings well inadvance for these situations I trust the board knows what they are doing Anyone who expected us to sign Laporte or Mustafi is just silly
may i suggest you check his injury record http www transfermarkt de serdar tasci verletzungen spieler 34593 last season was actually his first without a serious injury in a long time and given the luck Bayern have recently i fear it s just a matter of time until
fuck
As I mentioned in r fcbayern come stop by that was quick When we are in trouble back line injuries our board takes action Great to see a proactive board that is so good to the club Welcome Serdar
There was an article posted a while back either here or on r fcbayern about how board does transfers Apparently they ve got full teams of targets that they would go for in case of emergencies like this or that they just follow Not sure how unusual that is but it explains how we can get transfers done so quickly
I would love a link I ve always admired Bayern s transfer dealings and this sounds like a good read
Awesome thank you I m actually at work right now and so I probably can t get away with reading it ATM but i ll definitely check it out when I get out Much appreciated
I wonder who s in this shadow squad
Costa and Coman probably were part of it
I remember that interview too I will try to find it but it was quite some time ago so I will need to scroll through a lot of r fcbayern
I m having trouble finding it right now If I m remembering correctly it was from late last season early summer I ll update with the link if I find it
If only Man Utd s board would do the same
you guys are super lucky to have such a board Arsenal however hasn t spent on a DM for 7 seasons since letting go of 3 DMs in 2008
Um didn t Arsenal sign Elneny like less than a month ago
Box to box m8
Haven t watched Basel play since Shaqiri and Xhaka were on the team so I can t know for sure but from what I ve read he s a pure destroyer
Against Burnley on the weekend he was everywhere on the pitch It might be because Coquelin was playing too so he didn t feel obligated to hold He also wasn t afraid to shoot from distance which is nice It was only one game and it was his first game so it s too soon to judge He has a lot of energy though
Arsenal fan making everything about Arsenal Nothing out of the ordinary here
confirmation bias and fuck you
Lmfao
Oh Serdar what I would have given to see you return to Stuttgart s central defense to stabilize our shaky back line
I am kind of ashamed that there is a lot of so called Bayern fans that have never even heard about Serdar
I love that your sub is discussing his Fifa and FM ratings and comparing him to Badstuber via computer games
Tascis 1 in Bravery is going to make all the difference
When Gladbach signs a new player which I don t really know like Hinteregger my first move is to check his stats on Fifa The databases on sims are getting better and better so why not use it
We literally know nothing about him apart from that he captained Stuttgart against us in the DFB pokal final in 2013 It was either that or his one highlight reel on youtube
He spent a lot of time in the Bundesliga though and had represented Germany There s really no reason some of your fans shouldn t recognize him if you ve been following the club actually watching games
That was before the treble in 2013 mate how could they know
deleted
The other guy was clever yours is just an attempt at mirroring his humor
plastics
I suppose theres no way for fans of a German club to know anything about German internationals with hundreds of Bundesliga appearances
of course some of us know him especially us german bayern fans know him quite a bit
TBF FM s database has hundreds of professional scouts and thousands of amateur scouts Starting myself this year
Seriously new fans don t have to have heard of him and no I m not one of those who don t know him
Yea but the guy played in the BuLi like 3 years ago TBF he left the same year we won the CL so that is a factor I guess
Hell he was Stuttgart s captain and took a picture with Lahm before the DFB Pokal final
So you know every player who played in the BuLi over the last couple years
He played for the german national team won the Bundesliga and captained his club into the cup final If you are a german football fan or a fan of german football and you dont know who Serdar Tasci is you have to get a different hobby
not that I fall into that camp but why should Bayern fans be intimately familiar with another team s player Seems like a cheap way to say I M A REAL FAN GUYS
He was a league player for years He is German well ethnically Turkish but he played for the NT He captained Stuttgart against us in the 2013 final It s kind of hard to miss someone your team played against around 15 times
again I know who he is but I can imagine a lot of Bayern fans don t for a variety of reasons It seemed like a cheapshot to say people who aren t familiar aren t real fans
Yes I notice your comments in Bayern posts and it s obvious you have followed the club for some time instead of jumping the bandwagon in 2013 The problem is that the guy left the league in 2013 and who exactly would know anything about some guy who just played without attracting much attention if you haven t followed matches So you identify him quickly but someone who had no idea there was football outside of El Clasico and the WC definitely wouldn t There are also those who love the club but have spent the years prior to 2013 working and studying full time in that case you start losing track of other players I went through that for almost a year and I know I didn t follow football news much or matches other than Bayern s
I m actually curious how many of the bandwagon post Treble fans still exist and how many have moved on to other teams Hard to believe the treble was nearly 3 years ago and the finale dahoam almost 4
A good portion moved to Bar a started talking about GOAT MSN and whatnot Some joined L pool after Klopp
You re assuming they stayed there They probably are now moving to Etihad as we speak
Its kind of because if you follow Bayern you follow BuLi and when you do that you kind of should have at least heard the name of a guy that played 7years in it and actually won it
you would assume that but not everyone follows the league that closely some people ONLY watch Bayern does that make them lesser fans I don t know your original comment rubbed me the wrong way needlessly hostile
Maybe I misused the verb ashamed Its a bit more like sad
probably a better word yeah in any case it s also pretty pathetic that i m being downvoted now but that s not your fault
Nah man you made some good points no need to be downvoted
have you heard how he s played in Russia Some people say good some say bad I haven t heard anything and kind of forgot about him since he s left the BL
A very decent signing considering the position the club was in I think the most important thing is that he has experience I d rather play him than Kimmich at CB especially against tougher opponents than Hoffenheim
Desperate times call for desperate measures I guess D
well he is dead to me now
Dude he is no longer the player he was What if he helps you guys win or draw a game against Bayern in April
Wonder what Spartak Moscow fans think of this One of their starting CBs loaned out because Bayern needs a backup
in truth he ll likely see a lot of playtime due to injuries If Bayern signed him after the 6 month loan it s much more likely he becomes a backup
I m really wondering why they signed him I mean has the youth academie of FC Bayern really become that bad that there isn t a talent going to be a part in the team And why they signed Tasci i think they could have got a better defender for few money too But I don T want to be too cruel to Tasci too Let s see how he plays returning to the Bundesliga
Bayern II is playing in the 4th league Of course there s no one good enough You should think about on what kind of level the team is playing Tasci is only an emergency buy who s going to play a few minutes in the Bundesliga to give Badstuber Alaba and Benatia some rest
Yes I m sure about that But can you remember the time when v Gaal brought Muller and Badstuber out of nothing I m just afraid of Guardiola wasting good talents because he isn t interested in the club anymore
Bayern s youth academy hasn t become bad they ve never been particularly good compared to other German teams in the first place Somebody posted a chart here a while ago ranking German teams by number of minutes played by their academy products over a season or so Bayern ranked 18th
Look at the replies to the tweets the state of those fans
It s Twitter What do you expect
it s funny you could exchange twitter with basically every other social media webpage and you d still be right tells a lot about people really
That s a fairly nice and quick fix to their problem Could turn out well for them if he manages get close to the level when Stuttgart won the title
Well ain t that a blast from the past
Good loan actually risk free and we need CB s that are in good fitness right now used to be one of the best defenders in the BuLi when he played for Stuttgart I am in love with our Board they are not afraid to take action when needed German effeciency at it s finest and you can see the hard work done in the past to get us where we are now I always mention this in my comments and will always do
I don t think he s up for the tasci
I think he ll fit in well with Bayern his injury record while playing in Russia and before it is worse than Badstuber Way to find a solution for injuries with another injury prone player then everyone will start blaming the coach again The club should do its homework better before getting players what kind of scouting are they doing
His two worst injuries overlap and all the injuries before that were minor Something tells me these professional scouts that watch and follow the player know a thing or two more about scouting players than someone posting on Reddit basing their info off a website
What kind of player did you expect Bayern to sign in the last hours of the transfer window though According to his injury record you linked he was out injured the last time 2 years ago I honestly think there wasn t anything much better out there to help out a bit in the short term
Well you re probably short of options in the last minute I won t argue against that it s just ironic that we re getting a guy with an injury record as well If I m a club suffering from injuries on several injury prone players I think injury history check would be one of the first things on my list Hope he stays healthyGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
fuckers
Thank god all this 2 Championship clubs interested in Rhodes is finally over enjoy your Championship title Boro
One less player that we get constantly linked with
UP THE FUCKIN BORO YESSSSSSS I KNOCKED OVER A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE WHEN I SAW HIM HOLDING THE SHIRT
Serious serious coup for Boro Love Rhodes and he deserves a chance in the Premier League Hopefully he gets it and carries on his scoring run Have no idea how he hasn t been picked up sooner
Even still there have been a number of clubs who were willing to spend to get up Didn t put off Villa paying 6m for Gestede
Rhodes is also a poacher who you need to build a team around might have put some clubs off
I personally prefer the idea of Gary Hooper and Forestierri for 6 million over Jordan Rhodes But I see what you mean maybe has something to do with Blackburn wanting to keep a hold of him for obvious reasons too in the past
In fairness for us all we need is someone who can put the ball in the net Most games this season we ve created more chances than the other teams but can t finish them with Kike who s missed sitters etc We have the creativity the defence just not the finishing
Give us kike
gladly
No brainer really
Yep some rough assumptions c 10m transfer fee bonus payments if Boro promoted and if he scores certain amount of goals c 50k pw wages over 4 5 years was earning c 35 40 at Rovers Means the total deal is over 21m for a Striker with no prem experience That being said wish him the best of luck would love to see him do well in the Prem
Steve Gibson is ridiculous in the best possible way
The best chairman in English football Easily
Not even a fucking competition
Seriously he loves the club more than anything and keeps it going that s all that matters

Gutted about this he is one of my favourite players but I do wish him all the best it was clear that he does t fit with Lambert
On the plus side the fee and freeing up of the wages will allow you guys to bring in 3 maybe 4 players allow you to rebuild your team and go for promotion next season
It ll definitely free up wages I believe Rhodes was the biggest player on our wage bill
Goodbye my lover Goodbye my friend You have been the one You have been the one for me
That s Boro promoted Unless they somehow fuck it up
We aren t talking about Derby here
Heh fair point

Hey now we ve done it before Although I forget what happened after
So is this Rhodes guy any good
His scoring record is absolutely incredible at this level
Can t wait to see him play in the Prem
This surely secures Boro premier league status 80 goals in 160 odd appearances is brilliant 70 or so in 124 for Huddersfield and only 25 26 in a few days Great signing
I m in two minds about the transfer yeah we will miss his goals who wouldn t but he really doesn t have much else to his game and the rest of our squad isn t good enough for the type of striker he is I just hope we reinvest the money well
Lambert already looks like he is about to do the business bringing in Jordi Gomez till the end of the season Hopefully with an option to buy he would work perfectly alongside Akpan in the midfield i d even be tempted to play him in the hole behind Graham alongside Watt in a christmas tree formation
I always enjoyed his goalscoring but that was an incredible fee we have received I m pleased we waited till we had a proper manager in the door to spend the cash He has looked pretty disinterested this year even more so since Lambert put in our higher tempo workman like game Good luck to the lad though wish him all the best just not on Saturday
KARANKAMANIA IS RUNNING WILD
Boro s next game At home to Blackburn
Easy Grant Hanley s got this one
Your keepers always show up against us Twice last season Especially in that one you guys shouldn t have got the equalizer in
Welcome back to the Premiere League Boro
Lets hope so
With him and Ramirez I certainly feel a lot more confident about getting promotion Our defence is outstanding and our midfield is superb but we lack a real goalscorer and a creative forward
Did he change his ridiculous 70k w wage or
Rumours were that he was furious after the talks last night broke down so somethings changed Gibson wouldn t cave to those demands he never with Viduka years ago and he still wouldn t now
UTFB I waited all day for this took fucking ages to get sorted
Will be very interesting how he does for Boro most of the teams he has played for he has had teams built around him but I doubt this will happen at Boro He does have a fantastic goal record in this league and he reminds me of a younger Darren Bent
Would Austin not have been a better option Cheaper and a proven Premier League scorer
Ronaldo wouldn t have been a bad shout either Why would Austin have came to us over Southampton They are paying him about 100k a week
Southampton werentinterested to start with could have gone in early for him Not criticising the transfer as he will get them promoted but feel Austin was a missed opportunity Boro still a step up from QPR
Nah Austin was set on the PL and would never have came to another Championship team as good as it would have beenGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
That Manchester United rumour didn t last long then
It s reported that Wenger rejected the move https twitter com mattspiro status 694142108580593665 s 09
If true it would have been a bit stupid to strengthen us in a position we re struggling in this season with injuries fullback when we ve been awful all season and are still only 7 points back with 15 matches remaining
You strengthened us last year with Welbeck We strengthened you with RVP Sometimes it s good to do a rival a favor When Chelsea comes calling to Wenger next you think the Cech deal won t be in his mind and influence his decision Of course it will I personally would not mind this little favor
Next time we want to go shopping among United players I d rather have leverage They aren t going to top is because they have Debuchy Chelsea sent us Cech which in hindsight may have been a mistake but you think they won t bring that up when they want something from us That s how these things work I would have preferred to send RVP elsewhere but you think that favor was not a factor in them giving us Welbeck Weigh the risk vs potential advantage in future negotiations Debuchy is not 7 points for them he just isn t
Lost a flair bet Let me ask you will you be opposed to sending a second choice player to Chelsea 3 years from now if we win the title and maybe one other on the back of Cech Do you think Wenger will negotiate from the same position as if they had denied him Cech Be honest
Man United didn t do Welbeck a favor Van Gaal literally said he wasn t good enough to play for them and Arsenal snapped him up Chelsea didn t do Arsenal a favor they did Cech a favor You sound like an idiot Shut up
Of course they did Arsenal a favor they had no reason to sell him here one doesn t happen without the other Further welbeck could ve gone to plenty of teams United didn t sell him to Spurs who bid the same amount on deadline day They accepted the Arsenal bid instead
lol clueless
Can I guess where you come from
Sure It s a tough guess though I d assume unless you know me on this sub
Couldn t even sign him on loan My club is so fucked
We ll do something at some point
Get relegated
That was done months ago I m still hopeful we ll do something
Honest question after a few years of drab results are you kinda looking forward to dropping down a league and winning more games Must be pretty heart breaking to see 2 victories so far does the idea of winning 15 next season take the sting away somewhat
Any other season where we came about 15th i d say definitely not But compared to this season ye i d rather be a good championship team
We said the same and look what happened Good luck D
I just have to think like that at this point really to be honest What else is there to do
It was great for us not sure if Villa will come straight back up tho
You may be right Looking back at the squad you had then it was a pretty stacked for a championship side I don t see us being so lucky too many players will leave and our recruitment is poor so replacements will probably be pretty awful
A lot of teams were looking forward to coming down and winning more games and rebuilding themselves A lot of teams are still here several are in League One or below I d be a bit apprehensive if I were Villa Better teams have come down and struggled
villa are like west ham too big of a club to stay in league one they will be back in year guranteed only clubs like wigan wolves etc who havent got the cash the new era brings really suffer dropping down also their support is great
I was hoping Wenger would send him our way regardless He really wants to see us survive I wonder if he ll send any other Arsenal players our way on loan I wouldn t mind giving Welbeck a chance to regain fitness with us
The appointment of Remi Garde as our manager was influenced heavily by Wenger who told him to take a chance on saving us He believes that if he can save Villa then it will be a massive boost to his career It wouldn t surprise me if Wenger has been mentoring Garde In part it s what s recently fueled the rumours about Debuchy joining Villa
I don t think those rumors were false debuchy just didn t want to go to villa or Sunderland because he is being a prissy dick face
Do you really blame him Why go to a piss poor team when you can go to a solid team in your home country
Prissy Dick Face is probably more referencing how sulky he has been about losing his spot at RB didn t put up any real fight to take it back after Bellerin s emergence
yup pretty much spot on He made a huge deal of wanting to play so he could be in contention for the euros to the media at every chance he got and then was super picky when teams were desperate to have him
And he is allowed to He is perfectly right in demanding the way he wants his career to shape up
Yup and we are allowed to judge him for actions
wenger seems almost like a mentor to him helping him also being french as well i thought for sure he would sanction debuchy to villa they need the help and he wants to play for france in 2016
Unfortunately for you Sanogo is still at Ajax
i was hoping he d be loaned to Lazio Debuchy and Ravel would have been on the same team
I don t get it
Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel are two French classical music composers
2 deep 4 me m8
always finish on debussy
Right in Debussy
I prefer to finish on the Bach
Damn it I could ve worked that out
Took me a while but it was worth it
this will backfire 100
I think why we re seeing Chambers at RB in the FA cup He s going to fill any potential injury holes in our defense
Despite his goal there was one play he got burned by their winger when he got in tight It s going to be real bad if we have to put him up against any quality
inb4 Chambers vs Neymar
I shuddered when I read that The thought alone makes me want to crawl up into a ball
Might as well kick the ball to Cech to throw it into the net every time he comes down that side If Montero turned chambers into a training cone Neymar will act like he s not there
I already did
He ll have to be poor to do worse than Debuchy who was the worst player on the pitch when he played for us There s such a massive difference between the way with play with Bellerin in and when he s out We ve got to get him a titanium exoskeleton to wear when he s not playing
For future reference next time you can just shorten it to Bellerin and Bellerout
It is unbelievable how false this is
Not really Debuchy was terrible the last few times he played for us I get its not really his fault much since getting no playing time contributes to that but it doesnt change that fact
no he wasn t he was terrible against Wednesday and the match before that but since then he was fine he was good against spurs and while no one was good against Bayern he was one of the better ones
Completely disagree We can throw out the Bayern game but thought he was poor against spurs probably our worst player But you re entitled to your opinion Im sure bitching and moaning to the press didnt do him any favors with Wenger either
maybe but all rosicky does is bitch and moan to the media and he s still a r gunners favorite
In what way Chambers was better against Burnley than Debuchy in all but maybe one match He looks horribly unfit IMO every time he runs he looks much slower than he did last season
So I see you agree with u fsamuel
QUIET
Unlucky with injuries and Hector Bellerin
Shit mentality if you ask me Yes he s been very unlucky with injuries especially with the Arnautovic push which really fucked him over One thing that bothers me though is that he s an experienced PL proven France international and when he lost his place to a kid he barely showed any fight and willingness to compete with Bellerin for the starting spot Instead he opted to cry in interviews and express his discontent at not starting instead of trying his best to get his spot in the team back
People keep banging on about how he should have fought for his place but I don t see how when he has started only six games this season Even when Bellerin was pretty shit after his injury he got his starting spot back right away Plus it s pretty funny how every time there is this discussion Bellerin is mentioned as some average kid who s easy to displace As far as I know you re not watching the training sessions so I really don t know how you can assess that Debuchy wasn t even trying
AFAIK Wenger will speak if there s tough competition for a starting spot I would think at some point he would give credit to Debuchy for competing for the spot at some point this season if he was putting up a fight
He was a real liability in the games he has played Often caught out of position and completely off the pace of the game Maybe he just needs more game time but he didn t deserve any more minutes based on his performances regardless of Bellerin s quality
How do you know he wasn t also trying his best to work his way back in the team He could have been busting a gut every day in training for all you know
Then why does he look out of shape on the pitch He looks incredibly slow compared to last season and he has been awful in all but one appearance so far
He said in an interview that Bellerin deserved his place because he was playing really well Stop making things up pls
I m not making things up http news arseblog com 2015 12 mathieu debuchy rmc radio transcript in full

He was also crap every time he played We don t have to be nice about him it s not like he died tragically He was just pants
When Pre injury he looked great I thought he was going to be a minor step up from Sagna Then he got injured and lost his place to Bellerin only got a game here and there and looked expectedly rusty then left You can berate his mentality all you want for not digging for his spot but Wenger didn t spend 12m on him and he wasn t the starting French RB because he was pants
Pre injury Isn t that like three matches Didn t he get sent off in the Champions League He s had a fair few runs in the squad and he s always been a liability I always assumed he d get it together but this past year I ve just wanted him gone That was also possibly the worst France squad of my lifetime
Nice
No Bordeaux
I laughed
ASSE expected really
I am anger with your comment
Caen you guys please stop
but we don t want toulouse
what would your marseille
Monaco
Yo stop it with these comments you re driving me in Seine
I do nantes want to miss out on these french club puns
Well he did play for Lille for ages
Ouah I m pretty shocked to be honest I didn t expect a signing like that even though we needed a good RB the best one this season is Poko who play usually in the midfield
I would like to see Gajic more though Ok he was not that good for his first few games but we should give him more play time But Debuchy is a great one for us Nice to see some ambition from the board
Me too but with it s good to have some international experience added in our defence and in our team in general I mean pretty much half our squad was playing in CFA last year
Have you watched Debuchy recently I wouldn t use the word good to describe his current form
Enough game time and I have no doubt he will come good He has already proven himself to be a good player before his Arsenal stint
Finally Bordeaux does something interesting
malcom was an exciting transfer tho
Wow no idea that happened that is an exiting transfer
Well that s how transfers work gotta exit one place to join an other
Is he any good
He was sour grapes but understandably so
Good news
Bellerin and Chambers to each break a toe in a horrific bowling accident leaving Arsenal without a proper RB You heard it first here

sounds very plausible
Obviously a move only to get minutes before the Euros on France he rarely played on Arsenal this season sad because he is a quality rightback imo
Bellerin is going to get injured now
So if Bellerin gets injured who plays at RB Chambers
Yes
Which is a terrible plan He s not good enough to play right back for us
I agree with you but I m sure Debushy wanted more first team minutes
Happy for him He s a quality player who will hopefully come back to form before the summer
People keep banging on about how he should have fought for his place because he was going to fill any potential injury holes in our defense
Happy he didn t go to the mackems
I could see him being sold to Club America or Tigres over the summer He could join Gignac in Liga MX
Wow this is great Very unexpected too
Says a lot about arsenals squad level when they are loaning players to second tier French teams
Good Riddance
We got Calum Eat your heart out Messi Chambers anyway
Please don t

Is it a rule that Arsenal fans must bestow a cringeworthy nickname upon every player
The players did it first on this one
worse than Sparky or Scholsey
calling Scholes Scholesy and Giggs Giggsy is hardly cringeworthy
As the other guy said adding a Y to someone s name is hardly cringey As for Sparky well that was a name he gave himself long before playing for us The fact you had to go back 20 years to find an example is pretty desperate though Compare that to Canaldo B52 BFG Merteswagger Squid W l Le Coq Verminator and giving insulting nicknames to former players like Fabrecash and Robin Van Pursestrings This is just off the top of my head I know there s more
Le Coq sounds nice In French
I ve never heard of fabrecash and pursestrings before I only remember cashley Cole tbh

Good signing for Feyenoord
Without doubt the best deal van Geel has made this season
Fuckin sick of this shit from the board to be honest some washed up waste of money Mind boggling
The amount of money splashed on bang average or worse strikers between fees and wages over the last few years could have bought one or two good young or more proven players to partner Griffiths the cheap strategy hasn t paid off at all so far
They did try young a couple of times Puuki H lmbert Fri j nsson
Surely there are better young Scottish Strikers that Celtic have developed at Lennoxtown They have the best facilaties in Scotland surely someone there must be better than Cifti and some of the other imposters getting a game
I wasn t saying Celtic shouldn t give young Scottish players a chance I was saying that they have signed young strikers in the last few years
I m so glad he s gone Unfortunately Celtic are stuck with him now my second favourite team in the world
It s payback for Henrik
Laaaaaaaaarsson Laaaaaaaaaaaarsson
seriously why not spend this money on your academy Though I don t know in what state your academy is but as the biggest club in your country you should be able to produce players of atleast the same level as players like Boyata and Kazim
Doesn t matter how much you spend when they re lured away See Islam Feruz
Steady on son Clydes best in country
We have the best in Scotland and outside of the top four or five in England one of the best in Britain Just today we let one of our best youngsters out on loan which is infuriating We have players ready to call up but instead we are signing shite
Who needs an academy when we have the man city youth team
Getting rid of Ciftci and then bringing in Kazim Richards is the equivalent of getting rid of chlamydia and then finding out you ve got herpes
Well if so you are stuck with him Herpes is a lot harder to get rid of Chlamydia is fucking easy just pop some pills and boom back to tinder Not that I would know I heard from a friend
I don t think I trust big swinging dicks
A wise position to take
where did ciftci go
On loan to Eskisehirspor in Turkey
Read this earlier Where d you nick it from
Twitter of course
Thief
Sue me
At the same time as a supposedly extremely talented youngster Aidan Nesbitt is going out on loan What s the point in signing the likes of Carlton Cole and Colin Kazim Richards for bit part roles when you could be giving a chance to the many youth players you have
Even fucking Cifcti would be better The guy is proven at SPL and just needs time to adapt to Celtic Bringing in some arsehole who fights with everyone and is shite seems like a fucking retarded decision Honestly man Worst shout since Boerigter
https twitter com celticrumours status 694246342483406848
Anyone watched him play Obviously held in high regard though hopefully he can show it at a senior level
Congratulations to Celtic
I actually think he will do a decent job for Celtic considering how shit our league is
Better players than Colin Kazim Richards have came to Scotland and not done well The idea that a poor player from a better league is going to be a standout here is mostly a bit of a myth Players that work hard do well players that think they don t have to put a shift in fail
I saw Celtic play 2x against Ajax this year and they looked extremely bad Maybe Kazim can be a little bit useful to them
The way his attitude is I d say congratulations to Rangers
Thank you THANK YOU
I m sorry I m honestly really sorry Celtic doesn t deserve this But please please remember that we also gave you an amazing deal on Henrik Larsson So let s just call it even
I can t be mad at you I m just a little disappointed
A few years ago this would have actually been a pretty good signing really
Feyenoord finally getting revenge for losing Henrik Larsson on the cheap Way to play the long gave you sneaky Dutch bastards
I think the phrase rhymes with clucking bell
He s had the most diverse career path ever Bury Brighton Sheffield United Fenerbahce Toulouse loan Galatasaray Olympiacos loan Blackburn loan Bursaspor Feyenoord loan Feyenoord Celtic
The amount of loans say a lot Every club is desperate to get rid of the guy
I doubt he s gonna bring what Celtic needs
Underwhelming is all that comes to mind
Why do we go abroad for these shite strikers still Haven t the board learned anything from their wank decisions in the past
I was raging when I thought this was a loan but we ve signed the cunt permanently
Can t we just have signed Kristoff Ajer
I m sorry guys It s me who made it happen
Celtic will be dissapointed with a striker once again
I think we re used to it now
Yeah good luck with that
Feyenoord sending Celtic a late christmass gift
I hope we can return it
Why Ronny Why
Fuck it this season has already been fucking shite enough let s just heap more on
He s decided to take the number 13 Fucking hell
Griffiths Cole and Kazim Richards Imagine Griffiths gets injured what a fucking riot
Oh now come on Celtic On the other hand I need Kazim Richards manager to run my life In a few years time Tim Cook would practically beg me to take his place
lucky feyenoord
I don t care how old he is he will always be the Coca Cola Kid
Colin Kazim Richards check Carlton Cole check Emile Heskey get it sorted Celtic
The coca cola kid Lulz
Woopdefuckingdoo God Damnit
Celtic are the Bolton of the SPL always signing strikers ten years too late
Oh great a homophobic thug It just goes to show how detached the board are from the supporters Christ I doubt the orcs would even give him a second look
Lol
Even in the SPL he will struggle 366 games 53 Goals
hes still ok right

Another absurd fact about Ligue 1 this season Lyon currently 11th in the ranking is 7 points away from both relegation and Champions League
On the subject of interesting Ligue 1 facts OM keep Steve Mandanda has three younger brothers who are all keepers as well the second oldest after Steve is the keeper for Charleroi in the Belgian Pro League the third is in Ligue 2 and the fourth is in a lower tier league
http i imgur com xfa2Zd1 gif
This means relegation and Champions League are at this stage obviously only 14 points apart For comparison in other top leagues England Relegation and CL are 21 points apart Spain 24 points Germany 12 points Italy 23 points Portugal 29 points Russia 18 points
It should be noted that the Bundesliga has had less match days than other leagues which skews this statistic
and a lot of champions league spots relatively
Think you mean europe not promotion I m happy you included the portuguese league in there 3
Herp I meant Champions League Thanks for pointing that out France Portugal and Russia have nearly identical UEFA coefficients so I thought it relevant to include them
That is hilarious
Lyon is 7 points away from 18th place but for reasons I m not clear on Ligue 1 are only relegating two clubs this season 19th and 20th place So Lyon are actually 10 points away from relegation
It s still 3 relegation this season
If all the teams continue to pick up points at the same rate PSG would end the season with about 104 points Whereas the next best team Monaco would end with 64 points The difference of 40 points is the same as the total points a team would require in the entire season to stay in Ligue 1 going by the same rate of picking up points
40 hasn t sufficed in two of the last five Ligue 1 seasons including Monaco s relegation in 2011 but point made
If we win all our remaining games we can reach 108 points In 23 games so far we took 63 out of 69 points Only 3 draws The current record for most points in Ligue 1 is 89 points PSG 2014
Wait you guys haven t lost in the league How is that not being discussed more
Because people prefer to blame us for Ligue 1 being not competitive instead
Is Psg undefeated because they ve played well or because the opposition hasn t played well
Being undefeated always means you ve done something well at some point even if PSG is far above the other teams Check out Reims PSG on Ligue1official on Youtube Reims parked the bus and managed to score a lucky goal in the last minutes This is how a strike of invincibility ends Well PSG scored one minute later The Ligue 1 bashing is pretty intense this year with some reasons but if PSG finish the season without a lose I hope they ll get the praise they ll deserve
it s both Psg has been playing very well this season On the other hand the other competitive french teams lyon marseille are doing a chelsea eheh so the both combined boom
Both Our game improved this season most of the squad communicates well And the biggest budgets in Ligue 1 OL OM have ridiculous results this season
Like you guys are on for a historic season Undefeated league season perfectly reasonable argument for a CL challenge Why is no one talking about that
Because it s Ligue 1 and people on here will still find a way to tell us that it isn t an achievement that Ligue is such garbage that Aston Villa and Las Palmas would have pulled it off too etc The same persin that never watched Ligue 1 btw
I think this speaks to how shit the rest of the league has been rather than how good PSG have been To be 2nd with 39 points and 5 goal difference is a joke
Yup Not one team has been able to keep consistency in their performances
Well Lyon and Marseille have an especially bad season What is Angers even doing up there
Angers doesn t have many technical players but they are really well disciplined and surprised Ligue 1 teams after their ascent They are really interesting to watch this season along with Caen It s mostly defensive but they are well coordinated and efficient on the counters The players from those squads smell good sport and motivation They have a will to win games unlike both Olympiques
We re only the 18 19th lowest budget in the league but the little money that we have we use very well We didn t spent a single euro this summer recruiting only players whose contracts ended in ligue 2 Guys who don t really have what it takes to shine all by themselves but who can do wonders when working as a team Cheikh N Doye is the perfect example the guy is 29 yo used to play for Creteil last year came for free and is now hailed as one of the best players this season courted by several English clubs How no one else saw his potential before us is what s truly unbelievable And there are other players like this We didn t expect our comeback to ligue 1 after more than 20 years to play out this way but it s quite logical given the progress we ve made these past 5 years There was a quote the other day in le Monde that implied that when the French football aristocracy becomes decadent just look at OL OM it s only natural for the eager peasants at the door to take all that they can
Can t wait for PSG to meet their Waterloo then
Faced them twice already We took a real beating against them 5 1 the week before last but are one of the only three teams to have managed a draw too
haha premier crest d angers que je vois ici En tout cas putain de belle saison
Il y a 4 5 ans on tait 2 je crois 12 maintenant d apr s les stats
Ah There are literally dozen of you lol
Theoretically Montpellier aims to do the same Still it s exceptional how badly run OM and OL are at times But one way or another OM always seems to bounce back not sure about Lyon though
http www francefootball fr news Angers caen c est l economico 622683 Edit Ah yes I forgot about Sissoko
I have no idea which source was used there for Slimane Sissoko s transfer
I really think it speaks for both PSG is clearly better than last year
Well No Please
Yeah While Cavani has dipped a bit di Maria s been fire And with Chelsea s defensive issues it should make for an interesting match up
You and I have different meanings for the word interesting
Well PSG almost already win the French league Chelsea lost it s ability to win the English one Two quality teams that are now fully focused on the Champions League could be an interesting match up
On the other hand PSG s only real opponent so far has been a pretty shit Real Madrid under Benitez we don t really know yet how good PSG is against real opposition Guess we will have to wait who they draw in the quarter final to see
That being said the CL is the CL Chelsea hasn t been bad in it I really dont expect an easy game for PSG they re favourite but Chelsea clearly has a chance Cavani is kinda lost Zlatan has never been a clutch player in knockout stage many players are injured just back from injury and lack form Motta Silva Matuidi Verratti Luiz and Pastore is completly out of form And Maxwell imo doesnt have the legs for a very intense CL game
About that Sure Zlatan hasn t always turned up for PSG in CL but saying he isn t clutch in Knockout stages is wrong when you look at what he s done in both this and the last qualification play offs for Sweden Of course Chelsea still has a chance but the difference to last year is very much positive for PSG and very much negative for Chelsea
Can t watch your video now but I assume this is Sweden vs Portugal My bad I meant the CL knockout stage He very rarely turned up for any club past the group stage Although I believe he may do so this year
It s vs Denmark from this autumn
How shit they ve been vs PSG They ve been quite competitive between themselves otherwise Table is pretty tight
Perhaps it indicates increased competition throughout the league Rather than everyone just simultaneously being shit as you are saying Dont watch enough to know does someone more knowledgeable have input on this
Ofcourse not everyone is simultaneously being shit it s mostly our big teams OL OM Monaco For different reasons be it bad luck with injuries and lack of chemistry with new players Fekir injured Valbuena Beauvue being terrible for Lyon instability due to lack of money FFP DNCG french fiscality mostly thinking about Monaco here although french taxes dont apply to them Their big problem is the lack of home support not working well with FFP their squad is completly different from last season if you ask me Jardim is doing a good job with what he s given Marseille lacks money they also lost many players AND Bielsa and they bought some terrible players Monaco and Marseille also have a lot of players on loan this season So yeah it s mostly big teams underperforming On the other hand small clubs like Angers and Caen are doing great this season and Saint tienne and Nice are on the rise since a few years thanks to a pretty good management Stade Rennais also have a pretty good team on paper at least So I d say there s more competition for the big clubs definitely But it s partly due to these clubs being disappoiting I mean Monaco lost 3 0 to Angers this weekend Lyon lost to Gazelec Ajaccio PSG has 3 times Lyon s budget but Lyon has something like 10 times Gazelec s budget Money is an excuse especially with our fiscality But it cant excuse everything
deleted
Lyon didn t sell anyone
I think this just shows how f cked up the ligue1 is All you need is buy a club invest 800M on 3 years there you go Their budget for this year is 490M lol EDIT thanks u nvip75 Second one is Monaco with 250M Third is Lyon with 190M Still proves my point the budget of the second and the third do not equal the budget of PSG O o o O
No the second budget of France is Monaco 250M Lyon comes in 3rd postition 170M
indeed I missed Monaco sorry thank you for correcting me
You re welcome
Lyon just built their own stadium wich should boost their finances On the other hand they had a terrible mercato last summer But on the long term it is the only team that can challenge PSG in Ligue 1
Lol coming from the Bayern fan This is rich
The goal difference is the point of the statement really City have a 22 goal difference
And to be fair it s not like the big clubs in the PL have been very consistent this year
You realize United spent 50 millions for Martial who was only a sub last year When you have to sell half your players during the summer ofcourse you have to rely on defensive solidity to grind points hence the 5 goal difference
PSG has a better goal difference than all teams with a positive goal difference combined
Heh I checked this just after submitting too I believe it was 48 to 34
It s like a table from when i do a fifa career on amateur I presume they will do well in the champions league this year as they can basically rest their first team during the league matches
Well there has been a lot of rotation in the team I don t think the same lineup has been started twice in a row in the last 2 months
Nkunku Ongenda and Augustin sadly don t participate much in this rotation
Keep in mind that we have Lavezzi and Lucas Cavani on the bench Plus Pastore when fit can always play on the wing Its hard to pick an 18 year old when we have these kinds of players ready to play
Well augustin and ongenda started each one once in cup games but yeah they could be included more
Given their margin I am curious what team will they field in the league before the Chelsea game
They can break the Ligue 1 record for consecutive league matches without defeat against Lorient at home on Wed
consecutive league matches without defeat against Lorient doesn t sound too difficult
Heh I m probably missing a comma somewhere there
I believe your sentence is fine it s just linguistically ambiguous A comma wouldn t have saved you P
Nice
I wonder if they get Bordeaux the competition It surely Angers them a Lille bit
Caen the Bastia s just show some Marseille
I d be Lyon if I said Lorient Blanc isn t sadistic
He just doesn t want Toulouse
Haha come on guys have a lille mercy He uses that Ligue 1 platform and troyes hard in the CL
Either way he s been doing pretty well since he s taken over the Reims of that team
I Marseille this is getting out of hand
Guingamp
One of the biggest mistakes WWE made was having Bastia win the Royal Rumble when Daniel Bryan was so popular
You ve taken random to a whole another lvl
le random fun spork guy
Angers is pronounced differently so you sound a bit like Sean Connery
That and a Lille bit makes him sound Danish or something
I know but you Caen t knock me for Troyes ing
Stop already
What a Nancy boy Probably still suckin his mom s Brest
The competition is theirs Toulouse really
Yep and Marseille
Will we get a stat like this after every league game PSG play
Yes
More exciting than any stat coming from you Wraith Or me for that matter
Damn I ve been rumbled
I m looking for this post every Monday morning
24 points clear and there hasn t even been 24 matches played They are far too good
And everyone else is far too bad
Both of you pretty much just TLDR this current Ligue 1 season Last season was different next one may be too
Not to mention the 24pts clear of second place Monaco I wonder if that s an all time Ligue1 record
HOLY shit 24pts might as well give you guys the league trophy already
you never know they may now lose 8 games in a row while every other team in the league wins 8 games in a row by a 6 goal difference each game so they re all closer in points and goal difference
Could be could be
I ll still take the CL berth for 2nd thank you
Easily 2nd place is straight to group stage
Someone mentioned earlier this autumn that half of the teams in Ligue 2 had played in Ligue 1 within five years back I guess that also means a fair few of the teams in Ligue 1 lack consecutive experience in the top flight
1994 Paris Saint Germain 1995 Nantes 1996 Auxerre 1997 AS Monaco 1998 Lens 1999 Bordeaux 2000 AS Monaco 2001 Nantes RAAAAH LIGUE 1 is so competitive 2002 Lyon 2003 Lyon 2004 Lyon 2005 Lyon 2006 Lyon 2007 Lyon 2008 Lyon RAAAAH LIGUE 1 is so predictable and boring 2009 Bordeaux 2010 Marseille 2011 Lille 2012 Montpellier RAAAAH LIGUE 1 is so competitive 2013 PSG 2014 PSG 2015 PSG This league is a joke And I thought La Liga Bundesliga Serie A were bad And don t get me wrong they still are all utter bobbins n mickey mouse leagues A question for any PSG fans reading Do you feel at all embarrassed to be such an overkill team in your league Like is it even fun anymore
r soccer experts are unaware of anything football related that happened more than 2 seasons ago
What do you think people are going to say when a team is going to win the league 4 seasons in a row man this league is so competitive and entertaining well other than predicting first place it s an enjoyable league
That s because you re looking back instead of ahead You can t tell me who s going to win the EPL next season or even this one for that matter I sure as hell can tell you who s going to win Ligue 1 next season
City will win the EPL next season if not this season as well
Atletico winning La Liga was only one and a half seasons ago and it already gets ignored in these arguments
That big global sports wage study showed that PSG s average first team wages are 3 times greater than Monaco who was second among Ligue 1 teams So I d say the standings reflect the monetary influence that PSG currently wields and your list above corroborates that mapping to their influx of funds Lyon is slightly below Monaco and Marsaille is 1 4 the wage budget of PSG If the league table DOESN T look like what you see this year given how that league s budgets are set up then PSG is failing I think everyone knows the wage budget is more like the trend line that puts you in a position to win but there are always outlier datapoints and teams still need to win on the field However when the difference in wages is on the order of 3 1 ratio it s not a competitive league any longer Showing how the league worked prior to one team being handed a massive pile of cash 3 times greater than any other team in the league isn t all that meaningful
I am sorry but you are just whining here No one said Ligue 1 was shit when PSG won the last two years This year PSG s usual rivals are shit Afaik Lyon had only one year comparable to PSG this year where there was no competition at all and I don t see why people would not have made the same comments that are being made here
They ve got twice as many wins as Monaco How
They ve won more matches
Twice as many actually
Maths
Cheers
Every single team in League 1 has a GD between 9 and 9 bar 3 See now the league seems interesting and balanced The race for Europe might actually be really interesting
Ah such a balanced league
Says the Primeira Liga fan Unreal
And this is why no one watches French football Yes PSG could probably trounce most of the teams in the BPL but most other teams in Ligue 1 would get trounced by all the teams in the BPL
First of all it s not like this every season They had six unique champions in the six seasons from 08 through 13 Secondly people still watch BuLi despite Bayern s dominance So that s not solid reasoning Even more than competition at the top the league needs identity When four of the top 6 clubs are basically unknowns Angers Nice Caen and Rennes haven t placed top 3 in the last 40 years then the league is in disarray They need consistency in particular from well known clubs like Monaco OL OM and Girondins
Well Nice and Rennes have always been mid table teams This year s Nice is actually excellent offensively with Germain and Ben Arfa up top while Rennes has at least on paper a really competitive team Ntep Gourcuff Quintero
More than the EPL in over 2 decades hehe
Don t confuse him with facts as a side note Ligue 1 international TV rights are up 172 as he already made up his mind
Didn t Monaco beat Arsenal last year Also this is the first time PSG are dominating that much and it s more about the others teams being shit Last year title run was rly intense
We have a habit of screwing up when it matters the most asidefromgettingintothechampionsleague
The best players from the EPL are from Ligue 1 Without French football where would the British look to for their footballing talent
Last year Monaco knocked out Arsenal and PSG knocked out Chelsea of the CL Oh should I mention that Lyon was better than Monaco special mentions to Marseille who was ahead of everyone at the mid season You are overrating your league by quite a lot
Nobody has anything tolouse
Seems fair
Wouldn t you hit a point as PSG where it s more cost effective to have slightly LESS talent in your club and still clean up Ligue 1
The objective which matters the most is the Champions League so no
They want the CL though I would assume
If anything this just proves that they HAVE to do better in the CL or else their league would just look worse than it looks like right now
And almost double the wins PSG with 20 next highest with 11 Oh and currently undefeated
The second is nearly 30 points behind PSG
Please I m a family guy I want to be a father one day But if PSG drop out 2 Chelsea now I m gonna laugh my balls off
PSG pulling a Bayern
A question for any PSG fans reading Do you feel at all embarrassed to be such an overkill team in your league Like is it even fun anymore
Where were you when Lyon won it for 7 years straight Oh my bad you were still trying to obtain sphincter control
To be fair Lyon never ran away with the league to this degree It was usually a close race that just happened to have the same winner rather than a blowout right from the start like this season
Embarrassed by winning You re funny I just wish it was even more dominant even more ravaging You can always be better stronger
It s awesome No more or less enjoyable than when Juventus or Bayern walk their respective leagues
Napoli is first in the Serie A and Bayern has an 8 point lead compared to 24 points in Ligue 1
For the general PSG fans a season like this is a fuckng miracle The Buli has always been won by Bayern Our dominance while being overwhelming is recent
Clearly the Bundesliga has a problem although we won it in 2011 and 2012 so always is a bit of an overstatement The last time PSG didn t win the league was 2012 incidentally the same year Bayern didn t win it as well Ligue 1 has a similar problem but even more extreme as the budget differences between PSG and the rest of the league is wider The Bundesliga has the advantage that about 3 clubs have CL qualities in France it s just one club
Sure this season But it wasn t too long ago since Bayern won the league by 25pts while Juventus won Serie A by 19pts in consecutive seasons
It s a great feeling especially since it s a relatively new one PSG has never been this dominant in its young history It s awesome and I want more of it for now Not sure how I d feel about it if this goes on for the next ten seasons or so Also the lack of domestic opposition could seriously damper our chances at winning the UCL in the future
Great league
Quite Monaco prove it by removing you from the CL last year
I quite frankly don t give a shit if some Ligue 1 fan ends up shitting on me for saying this but it s utterly humiliating that there s only one decent team playing in the French top flight Besides PSG who let s not forget was boosted significantly by Qatari funds the rest of that league is seriously lacking in terms of quality
Quite ironic when you know that a main part of the problem is the drain of all the good players to BPL for ridiculous amount of money because of the TV deals
Maybe if French teams were doing better in the first place and thus securing better TV deals and sponsorships many youth players wouldn t have left for England Although I do recognise that this is a problem Well for you lot
Ligue 1 is doing better it is attracting more sponsors and better TV deals but that hasn t kept the EPL from pillaging the French leagues for all their talent Hence the irony of British criticisms You insult PSG and Ligue 1 because it s disproportionate financial advantages when those same advantages exist between the UK and the rest of Europe If this weren t the case and the EPL couldn t pillage talent from its continental peers the league would be an afterthought
Firstly it s England and English not the UK and British The Scottish have their own league as do the Welsh and the Northern Irish Secondly the Premier League organically obtained these financial advantages through smart negotiation and the rapid growth of British TV companies from a financial standpoint PSG received a sudden influx of state money Apples and oranges
it s far more complicated than that If BPL has developped back in the days it s because of huge investments of cash which snowballed and led to this result And also we don t have the football culture in France this sport is not as followed as in Spain GB or Italy And finally sponsors prefer to invest in rugby for example which is seen as a more classy and respectful sport for a company
The real problem is taxes Both clubs and players are getting bludgeoned with them meaning a french club would need far more money to hire the same squad as say a spanish one So less money means worse players means worse results means less sponsors means cheaper tv rights means less money
Death taxes and baguettes
PSG has no chill
What a joke The inequality in soccer is fucking sickening
This league is a joke
The greatest trick a stringy penny pinching accountant ever pulled was convincing Arsenal s board he didn t exist But he does And he name is Arsene Wenger And Arsenal hasn t won anything relevant in over a decade
this is how a broken league looks like one dominating super rich club the rest can t compete financially or on the pitch and whenever some clubs develop quality players they will get snatched away by the rich club or foreign clubs who can offer more money look how many players left the league during the last years and went to England Spain Italy Germany Russia Turkey etc there s no 2nd tier clubs left in terms of squad quality
To be fair the gap between let s say Bayern and Dortmund Gladbach Shalke is not as big as it is between Paris and the others
OK Did we win the title 17 times in the last 30 years No man you don t understand man Ligue 1 is broken man
this says absolutely nothing about the comparison between french and german league 2015 16
What s the difference between the sporting economic dynamic of Ligue 1 and the sporting economic dynamic of the Bundesliga
Says the guy from Bundesliga comedy hour here
it s not nearly as bad as in France not even close
Bayern won the Bundesliga by 25pts 2 season ago
I must agree but not because of your arguments
For a socialist democracy they sure have fucked up the football policies What a boring ligue it has become
You know what s boring Watching my Arsenal fan friends justify ridiculous ticket prices an incompetent club and a mediocre team every season and expect to win the league or compete for the champions league title Have you ever even watched a ligue 1 game What you re doing is kind of like going up to a poor person and laughing at them for being poor
BTFO
nice flair based insult that has absolutely nothing to do with his comment or the submission couldn t resist that shit on arsenal fans for karma temptation I guess
Because it totally makes sense for me to try and earn karma by pissing off the largest segment of this subreddit
there are way more people on here who dislike arsenal than there are who like arsenal are you kidding like 16 of this subreddit is arsenal fans the other 84 aren t

From Sunderland to south France give that agent a raise
isn t Marseille a shit hole though
I don t know but even if it was it must be a nicer shithole
Sunderland isn t even the actual definition of a city aint got no cathedral
That s not actually a requirement of being a city
Don t take this away from Lichfield
Still no cathedral
Can confirm
The players all live in mansions by the ocean or the beautiful hills east of Marseille by Aubagne La Ciotat Cassis the weather is the best you could ask for in France and I m sure they are very comfortable
It s very mixed But would rather live in the south of France than Sunderland
But Fletcher is Scottish
I have seen worse
Gotta be better than Toulon
Inner city Marseille is a bit of a dump I seriously doubt that s where Fletcher will live though
I d like to have been a fly on the wall when the Marseille team decided to bid on Fletcher just to know what they were smoking at the time
Wonder what they re smoking over at the V lodrome
We need someone to finish the chances than Cabella and Thauvin are bound to create
Cabella has actually been quite good for Marseille this season now that he s not being misused on the wings
Labrune and MLD busted out the old Ouija board
Lmaoooo
Michel has been asking for another striker since he joined Marseille and the board didnt want to get one didnt manage to get a better one Michel probably pressured them and they had to get someone before midnight
well this is random
One of the weirder transfers I ve seen
Some scottish players who played in France Ian Wallace Brest 1984 Eric Black Metz 1986 1991 Ray Stephen Nancy 1986 1991 Mo Johnston Nantes 1987 1989 Jamie Fullarton Bastia 1996 1997 John Collins Monaco 1996 1998 Neil Murray Lorient 1997 1998 Gary Smith Rennes 1996 1997 Allan Johnston Rennes 1996 1997 Iain Anderson Toulouse 1999 2000 Derek McInnes Toulouse 1999 2000
We also had a Scottish manager from 1925 29
hope he speaks in a faux French accent
Stephan Fletcheur
He can hire McLaren as an accent coach
McClaren why does everyone spell it wrong McLaren would Muk La Ren
Surprised to find out he s still only 28 hope he does well down there
Transfers I never expected to see for 100
His agent has earned his cut with this deal On a more serious note whilst he s hardly been on fire this season it s a goalscorer out the door and not replaced For all I m happy to clear wages etc an injury to Defoe and we re looking worryingly thin up front now
Fletcher s a decent striker if not the most likable character Hope we won t miss him too much
Best deal of the day
Incredibly happy to have him on board Hopefully he can have a conversation with his teammates before he leaves
At least his yearly turn into Lewandowski against Palace will be limited to just one game
God they just managed to get rid of De Ceglie and now they do this Thanks fuck I hope they keep Labrune for 10 more years
LABURNE
is he that bad
No but he s certainly not that good
Surely the weirdest transfer of the window Quite easily one of the strangest ones I ve ever seen anyway
How long till he does a Joey Barton Uhhh I think we uhhh played very well uhhh we had a lot of uhhh posession and uhh next game we will uhh take our chances oui oui
Good signing with the right service Fletcher is a very dangerous player
Dangerous for my blood pressure maybe
I ll have to disagree
Agreed he is a good finisher Due to his height teams try to hoof the ball up to him which isn t the type of player he is
I d say he could be an effective target man Problem is that whenever we ve used him as one he s been the only Sunderland player within 30 yards Cheers GusGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
Very excited to see how he does for us We seem have a few Celtic old boys in our squad along with a few from Watford Not sure how intentional that is but it can only help their team chemistry and spirit
Hope he does well for you I remember his opener vs Leicester like it was yesterday
How s Hooper doing I saw he scored a couple on his last game before joining you permanently
Fantastically slow to start but he s a consistent scorer with 7 goals in his last 7 appearances
Brilliant One of my favourite Celtic players of the last 10 years Still pissed that he s gone
He might not be as good looking but Leigh Griffiths seems to be doing just as good a job as hooper was having both would just be greedy
Honestly I d still rather have Hooper
I ve only seen him on telly but my bro has a season ticket he reckons Hooper has lost a lot of weight in his time with us hence the slow start and improvement For someone like him that first yard of acceleration is so important in the area
I d like to see what he looks like now but yeah he and Commons always came back from summer camps a little pudgy then shed it during the season getting better and better
Mate how good would a Griffiths and Hooper duo be
Surely have to be making the play offs now
Never in doubt
Your first home game back in the Premier League will be special Best ground I ve visited and that was when the ground wasn t even half full My Mother s boss is a Wycombe fan and he travelled up to your promotion game in 2012 said it was 90 minutes of goosebumps and the Wednesday fans were friendly
It was already a strong likelihood this is a real statement of intent Nice to turn some previous loan signings into permanent ones recently hopefully McGeady will make us do the same with him Its an exciting time to follow The Wednesday
mr inconsistent worth the gamble for wednesday though considering it s a level below what he is used to will be good for him to get some gametime for euro 16
Honestly thought he would do well for Everton when he arrived from Russia but I haven t heard anything since that transfer Almost completely forgot he was at Everton to be honest
he s way too inconsistent to be given game time which he wont get better about without getting time so hopefully first team football will help him out
He s also shit don t forget that
Most frustrating player I ve seen for Ireland Not to say worst not by a long shot but god damn can he do your head in
Hero against Georgia away but that s it We became a much better team when he was dropped
It s amazing how many people I ve heard say they want McGeady to start over Walters Walters is the much better option right now and plays consistently at club level and has been pretty good for Ireland in the last year
I hear you Most of the time he s shit and then every few games there ll be a spark of pure fucking brilliance that makes you wonder if it s the same player
but he s really really good at playing against really really shit defenders ie SPL it s a good move for both parties I reckon
Performed well for Celtic at Champions League level and was made captain playing in Russia for Spartak as he was a stand out Bad spell at Everton but is proven against a better level than SPL
Yeah but let s not rain on their SPL is shit parade Like Larsson isn t one of the best strikers of the past 15 years
gerry d stepped up and took his spot
I ve kept my eye on Wednesday ever since Stevie May went down but now I ve got a good few reasons Excited to see how this all works out
God I the Stevie May transfer had worked out I was so excited initially but he very quickly began to disappoint
Yeah man He absolutely set the SPL alight when he was here pace strength finishing He looked fantastic I think the fact that he moved away from home was a big contributor to his poor performance down South Heard he has a bad injury and will be out until next season Such a disappointment Hope he regains some form soon
Every time I watched him in person for Wednesday he seemed like he just couldn t hit the ball properly swear his foot just turned to jelly every time he went to shoot He seems very likeable though so I do hope he gets back to his old self
Pace strength finishing Thinks he didn t display in a Wednesday shirt
That s a real shame looked like a sure thing for Scotland squad in a few years Hoping he can get back to his best
Not setting the world alight at Preston either I ve heard
Injured isn t he for like 2 years
Not next season the season after
Use him well He loves to run at players and he s more than good enough for the Championship
Far too inconsistent for us but I think he ll be able to tear up the Championship Good signing for Wednesday
Mate today is monday
Never heard that one before
Look man I m portuguese I don t often get the chance to do this
Why Do you guys go straight to Tuesday in Portugal
Yeah we re so knee deep in debt we had to sell a day
Aw go on then 3
He wasn t going to get any game time here with Deleufeu and Lennon ahead of him He wasn t good enough for us but he was a cheap gamble Good luck to him
Heard a rumour that we d been in for him It s a shame nothing came of it
Hope he gets plenty of time ahead of the Euros
Optimistic about this could do well in the Champ Got an unpleasant vision of Hooper waiting for a delivery whilst Aiden checks back a dozen times though
This transfer is all the more sweeter after Steve Evans comments regarding Leeds interest in him
Yeah Bastards P
As always everyone around us strengthens their squad while Mick does nothing
What happened to the Tyrone Mings millions 8m is a decent sum for any club especially for a Championship side
Mick McCarthy seems to be morally against paying fees for footballers He s barely spent a penny since he became manager Most of it must go to wages
Spare a thought our manager plays centre mids out wide and refuses to sign anything resembling a winger At least you have a quality squad
Oh yeah I m happy we can at least challenge for the playoffs just frustrating we never seem to show ambition to push on
Yay I hope they buy him
That bad huh
Just so frustrating He has flashes of individual brilliance like his goal against Leicester last year but he makes too many poor decisions to justify picking him like when he got sent off in the replay against West Ham in last season s FA Cup
That s all I ve seen from Everton fans honestly not going to listen to them remember when Palace fans were saying Barry Bannan was shit
Good point And he s basically the best player I ve seen in a Wednesday shirt since Di Canio
Didn t people say signing Westwood was a mistake too just because his time in Sunderland didn t work out McGeady could be great he could be crap but most likely he ll be both in extremely frustrating performances That s his trademark as much as that spin
I believe so and that s turned out to be an amazing bit of business I think I can agree with that I don t expect him to be a world beater especially as soon as he comes in seen as he hasn t played much football but when he gets fully fit and firing I can see him being a fantastic winger in the championship
This is the thing sometimes moves just don t work out and a change of scenery re ignites things Here s hoping that s the case with McGeady
Did we Most I heard from Palace fans was that he wasn t good enough for the Prem and needed gametime that we couldn t give him Always had a cracking left foot and an eye for a pass that much is certain
When we first announced the signing on Twitter there was a bunch of Palace fans laughing and saying how bad he was tbh it was a minority of fans so I m assuming the overall opinion is what you said
I believe your first mistake there was listening to fans on Twitter Seriously though I m very glad to see him do well I think the general consensus amongst Palace fans was that he needed to perhaps work on his decision making a little and moreover needed some gametime to smooth out his flaws gametime that we couldn t offer given how our midfield was so full of quality With all that said I think everyone knew he was very gifted on the ball so a move was best for both sides really
Haha you re probably right And I think I can agree with that consensus we ve made him one of the main man and just let him operate on the ball and pick out passes all over the pitch I think the way our manager sets up the team does suit him quite well so it s been a match made in heaven Glad he s staying here long term
Tom Lees was shit as well remember
Pulled Leeds trousers down with that one needs to get back from injury now
His heads a mess bad temprement But if he hits a good spell and gains confidence he could be a top top player for you guys
He s about as good as lennon Our fans love scapegoats so no matter how they play they ll crucify them See naisy
What you on about mate Every Evertonian I know myself included loves Naismith
and me
Under moyes and a decent time under Martinez the common consensus was naisy probably couldn t even cut it in the championship Not athletic waste of space I kept saying he was our best player in front of goal when our forward options were truly shit and he was just playing in a terrible position out wide But nah I was told I was an idiot who has never watched football
Mate as soon as Naismith starting performing the fans came around He left with the backing of almost every single Evertonian Naismith was slagged off when he played on the wing because he was dreadful there and once moved central he was great McGeady has been played in his preferred position his entire Everton career and save for a handful of moments hasn t been good enough
Lmao don t try to say mcgeady is just shit He ll play a decent game give the ball away once and the same shit fans like you throw him out for that one mistake Are you really saying naisy magically stopped being shit He still had a few mistakes but people stopped focusing on them and actually gave him praise for contributions Look at Barry same treatment hasn t performed reasonably different but now people actually see that he s not shit because he gave away the ball that one time Our fans opinions are hilariously stagnate until some pundit tells them what to think
It s a different league though and I do think Barry Bannan is shit he never actually does anything
In a team where Forestieri and Hooper are smashing the goals in I still think Bannan is a better player than both of them He doesn t do anything in terms of getting goals and assists but he controls the game He just sees the big picture and makes us tick
He might be good at Championship level but I ve literally never seen him do anything of note in a Scotland shirt or in a Premier League game There s a reason he s 26 and never played a full season in his career Crystal Palace fans were right to say he s pish because at Premier League level he is
But your first comment implied he was shit overall He s been immense in a Wednesday shirt 26 isn t that old still got time to improve he may be too small and weak in Prem though but technically he s looked good enough for us
Everyone s good at a certain level he is shit at a good level of football
There s something a bit odd about a fan of an SPL club implying that the Championship isn t a good level of football
I m under no delusions that almost everybody in the SPL would be terrible in the Premier League unlike this guy
Watch him in a Wednesday shirt before you say he doesn t do anything he works his socks off every single game and has fantastic quality to match
He takes corners and that But seriously he s quite the little technician
He might be good in the championship Honestly he s not even that bad just inconsistent poor decision making quite often and not as good as our other wingers
You ve got to give it to Wednesday they re having a real go at beefing up for a promotion push
Wednesday really going for it this season Hooper and McGeady are big signings for them McGeady can be a frustrating player but I think he ll perform really well for them in the Championship
What s interesting is that we really seem to have a proper squad we can make considerable amounts of changes without it being obvious which is the proper 1st XI And some real quality on top of that mix Forestieri in particular is just fantastic to have on board
Gutted given the choice over us Wednesday though its a no brainier at the moment
Really pleased with this signing think he will be a monster in this league Was worried we would go out and splooge money needlessly these last couple of days but this is a smart signing cheap quality and won t disrupt what seems to be a very happy and confident team Wish we d tied Pudil down to a permanent deal but as far as transfer windows go this has been a great one
Will be 30 this year and will inevitably start to lose the pace and quick feet which is his main asset can do a job in the Championship but his best days are behind him which is a shame because he looked to have so much potential as a youngster
Moving to Spartak Moscow was probably the worst thing he could have doneGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
On the bright side at least there ll be one Scotsman playing in France this summer
well my mood just got considerably worse
D
No chill
No chill savage

context
Scotland isn t in the Euros
they lost to georgia xD
Haha you couldn t win against a team that got beat by Georgia
we got 4 points against the world champions and are going to france with a good chance of making it to the knockout stages i wonder how far scotland will get oh wait
Jesus don t be a prick about it lad
they were the pricks initially so they deserve it
But he s right you couldn t beat a team that lost to Georgia
we beat the world champions and are going to the euros unlike them
Y u do dis
What the fuck
He must be moving to the city of Marseille Not the football club
The commute to work is a bitch but at least he won t be living in fucking Sunderland anymore
As if he was living in Sunderland anyway
It s awful It s the most congested city in Europe after Warsaw
I have heard from my mate that Marseille is the Ghetto of France how true is this
They do have a habit of weirdly buying average British players See Barton Joey and Mears Tyrone
Any reason you ve listed their names like that
Reason No
Reading too many academic essays for college where authors names are written like that I know I should have written the initial rather than the full first name but I didn t know if people on here would know who Mears T was
I thought it was Barton Joey and Mears Tyrone
Yeah it looks bad alright
r iamverysmart
Oh do fuck off
Don t act like a pretentious twat then
How in fucks name was it pretentious
Because there s no need at all to call them anything but Joey Barton and Tyrone Mears All you did was make your own comment slightly less comprehensible than it otherwise would have been and then go on about how you would have made it even more needlessly obscured but people wouldn t understand You have to realise it makes you sound like a bit of an arse
Is Joey Barton really average I think he s a cunt along with the rest of us but he s a hell of a player
Hell of a player might be going too far though I mean He was good but not a hell of a player I don t think
Trying to get a repeat of Waddle
Mears was very decent and then destroyed his leg hence his naffness now
Possible dream ex safc nufc forward line of Fletcher Cabella and Thauvin
Dream
It s better than Altidore Riviere and Sammy Ameobi though
Quinn Phillips and Shearer would be more effective
Arguable
You re not wrong Altidore had more goals than all three of those put together last season
Well as far as weird transfers go this is up there with Alan Hutton to Real Mallorca
Tyrone Mears for me Completely average talent playing for Derby County somehow managed to negotiate a loan deal with Marseille behind Derby s back
Garry O Connor to Lokomotiv Moscow
Or Aiden McGeady to Spartak
He was a great player for Celtic and done not too bad at Spartak though
True but Russia seemed a very unlikely destination for him England would have been the most expected move
He just came the long way round
Didn t he actually climb out a window at Derby s training ground to go sign the deal in Marseille
Yep he had to crawl past Paul Jewells office too He is also the same guy who thought his dad Jamaican but later found out he was from Sierra Leone
Don t forgot to add he found AFTER playing international football for Jamaica
Bit of a stupid thing to think but its not 100 his fault He basically just said yeah I think my dads part Jamaican and the FA was like right get this kit on then lad
You d think they d at least check his dads nationality but maybe I m expecting too much from a football association
Because Mears only played in a friendly there was no penalty for capping him despite his ineligibility These days the JFF Jamaica Football Federation which is our FA usually won t cap a player at all even in a friendly until they have their paperwork or their ancestral claims are rock solid This kind of thing probably won t happen again
Faubert to Madrid still wins it for me
Woodgate Had the worst debut and 2nd game ever
Yeah but Jonny was a top class centre half at the time The moves in question here involve average or below average players moving to bigger teams abroad for whatever reason
Graveson to Madrid then
bought the wrong bald white guy from us
Still a weird transfer
LadsOnTour
Its over Its finally over Goodbye you doughnut eating prick
If only he could get transferred out of the Scotland squad
Starchan would find a way to give the man a contract at international level
So frustrating he s an absolute donkey We ll never qualify for anything with him in the side Was gutted he got a couple of goals in the qualifiers there will make Strachan feel justified in picking him for the next campaign
Two prolific players in their leagues with Griffiths and Rhodes Stuck with Stevie Knowing our national set up if Kenny Miller didn t retire from Scotland duty he d still be kicking about
Hated him too Second touch is a tackle for that guy
And his fucking eyes are so deeply set in his head it pisses me off
Harsh once he was your talisman and a technically gifted one at that Unfortunately injuries got the better of him
One season with 11 goals followed by three seasons of being consistently terrible He was never good enough to be a main striker and the fans have known that for since 2013 Unfortunately every manage we ve had has clung to Fletch Each season they tell us that he will start to produce the goods and each season he wastes the few goal scoring opportunities he gets Mackems can forgive the injuries We can t forgive laziness
He s a pisshead cunt who couldn t give a fuck
Stevie s going on his holidays Bet he ll be chuffed with this When was the last time there was a Scotsman kicking about Ligue 1
that would be McInnes back in 1999 2000 https en wikipedia org wiki Derek McInnes
Wow Didn t know that Doesn t seem like it was a very successful period for him
I thought it was still John Collins
Legend
Don t know Kinda surprised it s not as many One of our early managers was a Scot Victor Gibson in 1925 29
Marseille need to invest in new scouts
or just give the ones they have internet access
To explain this one a little bit Fletcher is out of contract at the end of the season and bar his contribution when he originally signed with us he has done fuck all in terms of anything relevant other than to warn us of the dangers of poor confidence when balding As for Marseille I have no idea what they are thinking
They wanted Odemwingie but Stoke declined and in their heads Fletcher is the next best thing in their heads
Both lazy arse mercenaries the logic checks out mate
Zombie Zombie Zomb AY AY AY
Lyon should respond to this by bringing in Danny Graham
Ships sailed gone to Blackburn Still have one Valentin Roberge who I reckon could do a job up top
Whatever happened to that guy who scored the hilarious own goal
We loaned him out to Getafe He was sent off in his first game He s a grade A nugget that lad
Bring him home
Vergini I think it is Quality own goal that I was gob smacked I think he s playing in a foreign league and scored a cracking goal recently in the correct net
Obviously they should bring in BasedShola
This is a strange one Interesting
but why
What
Can a Sunderland or Marseille fan try and make some sense of this Cheers
Marseille have only 1 striker Batshuayi They have been trying to sign another one on loan for a few weeks but they failed So they tried Eder from Swansea and Fletcher today I don t know why they picked him though
But Fletcher
When Labrune is in charge or transfers weird shit happens
I feel for you man At least he managed to get 15m Cabella AND Thauvin on load although i d assume you re not so excited about Thauvin coming back
No most fans I ve talked to are happy to have him back he was always a solid performer for us You can see in the photos he is happy to be back as well I imagine he was a bit cold up there The only problem is we re not really sure where to fit him in We have plenty of depth on the wings
A winger who always runs back in the middle yeah you definitely did not lack this profile IIRC he received a lot of praise from Bielsa last season but he never really lived up to his expectations He kept playing him but he was the only player who didnt seem to improve under Bielsa But I assume Newcastle pays his wages so yeah not so bad I bet he s glad yeah plus no adaptation time But the OM fan I talked to wasnt really excited
There are some mixed emotions about him since he has the potential to be a locker room liability I think depending on how often Michel plays him we will know where that original comment was directed
And I think we re trying to sign Batshuayi anyway
Stoke isn t getting Batshuayi unless yous bid something ridiculous like 35 million in which case I doubt he d be keen on the move considering he has top clubs in for him He ll leave Marseille for a top team next year if they don t invest wisely and show ambition
They won t sell him before the summer
He s shite injury prone and on a decent wedge We ll want him off the books ASAP so we can free up some wages for possible new signings
I guess I m more confused at what Marseille could possibly get out of this Are you signing another striker Can Khazri pay there
Absolutely nee idea to be honest marra Ideally I d like to see us bring a new face or two in but who knows This deal could be in place to help with Khaz s wages or we could have an ace up our sleeves Can never be certain with Sunderland
Khazri is a winger number 10
Good luck to him always be a legend here for his goals in the league cup final win Was also a cracking player in England for his first 4 years
Please please please sign him he s mint
The Auld Alliance
Oh this is great This guy is such a mouth breather
Sunderland just know we ll give them the points to stay up again
Fella stole a living proper shit
Maybe he s just going on vacation
Fuck me his agent must have played an absolute blinder there
Well this is an interesting one
What
Very very strange signing Marseille do have a habit of signing journeyman Premier League relegation fodder players though see Tyrone Mears of Burnley Derby and illegally playing for Jamaica fame
Sells Payet Imbula Thauvin loses Gignac Ayew on free s Buys Steven Fletcher Eder brings in Thauvin on loan What the fuck is going on at Marseille
And this windows unexpected transfer goes to
What the fuck
I m not sure if this is more a step up for him or a step down for Marseille There was a time when I thought he was good enough to play for a bigger club in England than Burnley Wolves or Sunderland but those days are well behind him
Good classico incoming
Are Sunderland trying to get relegated
More like trying to stay up he s dogshite
What Fletcher is fucking wank man and a class A Bellwhiff glad to be shot of him and the zero contribution he brings to our team
I had no idea Sunderland fans hated him so much in my mind he was the squad s loyal workhorse
That seems to have been a few years ago Imagine if Tiote stays with us for another few years getting slightly worse each one then you d be in their position
Assuming that was an incorrect assumption
Aye he s as lazy as you like
Workshy more like
Clueless The bloke is absolutely shite He also hasn t played for us in a while and if it were him leading the line we d be in a significantly worse position He has talent he s just the laziest knacker walkingGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
Fazio is a really interesting case We are all learned that the small spanish South American players struggle in England but again and again there comes examples of the opposite On the other hand big strong defenders like Fazio Amorebieta Albentosa and Carrico all fail in England and are brilliant in Spain I really think the difference between South America or Iberia and England is way higher for defenders than attackers
His physique wasn t his downfall it was the speed of the game He was out of position so many times when he played due to the fast nature of the game over here Pochettino always has one defender pressing and the other sitting he was the sitter but he was ALWAYS out of position
Just stay still fazio and keep your line I go NO
I no keep That Hugo Me Fazio
Yes and that is basically the downfall for most of them The job he was expected to do is so different from the job he did at Sevilla The latin defending are much more based on pushing up and gambling When he did that in Sevilla Pareja or Coke or any other defender he played with expected it and was ready to secure him if he was out of position In Tottenham you end up with Walker or Verthongen just wondering WTF he is doing It isnt a case of right and wrong but a huge cultural difference that I think is ignored to much
It may be a cultural difference but he gets paid a lot of money to train every day to knock that out of his head and learn to play in a different way He basically just decided that he hated the weather
I can t blame him I get depressed with gloomy weather maybe he has the same
That s why so many of us flock over to Spain so often
He was a poor fit for the system He d have been fine for a different system
I feel like Funes Mori Rojo and Fernandez are doing good though
Different types of defenders only one who fits that is Fernandez and he hasn t been the most consistent always
Rojo has apparently upset Van Gaal so even without his current injury i m sure we wouldn t be seeing much of him
He d surely start over Borthwick Jackson no
completely bs on upsetting LVG if that was the case he would be gone like Valdes and Bojack is pretty good but Rojo is on another level
Maybe he had a shot on target in training
Silva
Federico
Oops my bad
Thanks for the hard work Fazio Sorry it didn t work out
Literally the only good thing I saw him do was flatten the fuck out of that Crystal Palace player who was trying to pick on Lloris Didnt t hear a peep out of the prick after that I think he stayed in his own half
Spurs FINALLY clearing of the deadwood Pochettino has done a tremendous job
Hmm was hoping for something permanent and not just a loan If we don t drop Dier to CB then it ll be Carter Vickers on the bench Much as I like our youthful team I m really unsure if he s a good enough back up CB while Jan is out for us to get Top 4
I thought he was sold to Roma or Napoli
Yeah we know it makes no sense
It makes total sense Pochettino doesn t want him CCV has been promoted to take Fazios place
Toby Vertonghen Dier Wimmer CCV He s 6th choice
Ben Davies can play CB too
CCV
Cameron Carter Vickers Poch rates him highly
Really That bodes well for US fans then I can t say I ve watched him enough to really judge him but I can certainly trust Poch s opinion
That s the beauty of Poch He doesn t care where you re from As long as you can run all day and do what he says you get play time
Yeah that s not what I m worried about I just don t know how good the kid really is but I m fairly excited Kid was playing u21 international and club at 17 18
Didn t you hear The greatest hardship in the world of soccer is being American
Sorry forgot you were in the know about everything football and what managers are thinking
A fair amount about Premier League football So many interviews have been held with managers about communication and team dynamic It s not even an English phenomenon It s very prominent or was I watch Serie A a little less now in Italian football That s one reason why so many transfers don t work out
I would say it seems poch has a preference for Argentines for that matter
Initially I would agree However that was likely down to the communication His English has improved drastically To be fair you could pick a worse nation to have a preference towards
Could very well be I remember when he wouldn t address media in English Haha Messi to Spurs you heard it here first
I d take Messi even if he had one leg
Carter vickers
ccv
One injured ones out only holding CM and CCV hasn t played Add to the fact we ve got a ridiculous schedule with Europa and FA cup coming up
Fazio would still get zero minutes so I don t get why you are moaning
not moaning just makes no sense is all
Yes it does Why waste money on a player that will get zero minutes on the pitch because the manager obviously doesn t rate him when we have an academy product that can replace him Also you have to take into account that Fazio probably doesn t want to waste more of his career on the bench not even on the bench most of the time There is nothing strange about this at all
We ve been paying a player who did fuck all in our team It makes sense It s the best for both all three parties
Wasn t even a bad defender would probably be great in a team like Chelsea who park the bus He obviously wasn t suited to our attacking football Though it was always funny to see idiot Spurs fans at the time high fiving eachother because we signed a slow CB with attitude problems who captained a EL winning team which he didn t and whose main quality was punching another player get silenced Our fans are thick and I suspect we ll see history repeat itself if we sign Berahino
No fucking shit Sherlock did you figure that out while scratching your Buzz lightyear chin
Pretending to be a big man on the internet just shows how shitty the rest of your life must be Sad sad man
There is no correlation
First time I think I ve ever rooted for Arsenal but yeah fuck this guy haha
That s not very nice Whilst I agree with you on the Berahino situation it doesn t mean our fans are thick There is justification to wanting to sign Berahino he has talent and is young The issue would be his attitude Where as with Fazio he was a last minute replacement for Musacchio who decided he didn t want to sign with us It was a depth purchase You quickly realised he fell out of favour and that s why he hasn t been playing But I d rather have had him there than not Which is a similar argument that people have for Berahino We resolved the CB situation by signing Alderweireld and Wimmer Now as we have N Jie injured we have the option of allowing Chadli to be a striker allowing Son to be more of a striker or signing another one I personally would rather we held off until the summer from a team dynamic point of view However it could be beneficial to get Berahino get him properly fit by having him train with us and play with the U21 sGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
Arry could do better
no draw at all hmm Enrique is a gambler
So take double chance 12 bets on all Barca games vs top clubs Interesting
That loss against Bayern was explainable though he had a tough fixture coming and took off some good players to rest them because he knew that the results didn t matter that much
yeah i remember watching that bayern needed to score 5 goals in 45 minutes to advance and enrique knew that wasnt going to happen so he took off suarez and played double pivot to stay fresh for the final that 3 2 scoreline made the semi look a lot closer than it actually was when in reality barca just simply outclassed bayern throughout
no it was 2 1 barca at half time so they were leading 5 1 on aggregate hence they needed 5 goals if youre going to be pedantic at least be right
I didn t mean to be pedantic just chatting about it I remember all the Bayern goals being in the second half so my mistake
How was he being pedantic
nitpicky is the word i meant
Those wins against Bayern and PSG were also explainable Half of the starting XI for both clubs were missing
Yes the 3 0 was against a reduced Bayern squad as was the 1 3 against PSG But tell the truth PSG had strong squads for the 3 1 in the group stage and the 2 0 in the quarter finals EDIT Since I m getting downvoted for facts 1 For the 3 1 group stage match Barca won while missing Rafinha Alves and Vermaelen PSG was only missing Bahebeck 2 For the 2 0 win PSG was missing Motta Silva and Aurier We were missing Vermaelen
Dont care challenge the narrative that only Bayerns were missing players thus being the only team at a disadvantage
To be fair they were missing four starters Alaba Ribery Robben Badstuber at the Camp Nou
Revenge for Barca missing key players in the 7 0
And Martinez right
Alaba ribery robben badstuber martinez were missing Lahm thiago schweinsteiger and benatia came back from injury and were far from their best
I doubt Badstuber is a starter for Bayern but you re right
Well Badstuber would have started that match if he was fit The best lineup would be badstuber and boateng in a back 4 with martinez in midfield
Thanks for the correction Boateng aside it s hard to keep track of their back line
I think u AGNVHL is saying is that the Bayern loss was the second leg of a semi final whose first leg Barcelona had won 3 0 Barca were never in any danger of failing to go through
Yeah Bayern got that early goal but Barca responded with two quick ones to put the match away early
Whereas his record against Celta isn t all that great 2L 1W Really nervous for the Liga game a few weeks from now Celta seems to know Lucho s weak points
They just play properly against us It s always the same blueprint Pressure in the back pressure in the middle lots of physicality quick counters This is the only way that smaller teams can beat us and there are several that can or have come very close
Quick Arsene take note
Prepare to add 2 more losses to that when Barca plays Arsenal
Confidence I love it Stranger things have happened
2 loss was at the beginning of the season The third one is where he rested against Bayern Amazing O o
If these were taken as aggregate like they should for CL then it s only RM that has outdone him Barca beat RM in Nou fixture right
Like total aggregate or just for those two league fixtures On total Enrique s Barca wins 7 4 on aggregate but if you only count last season s league games then Real wins 4 3
The first PSG match was in CL group stages last year So not technically aggregate either
I just realised his side completed 3 comeback victories out of 6 wins against Atletico That 2 3 first half was something else last year
Really impressive I had my doubts when he was first appointed but he has blown my expectations away completely very happy with Lucho
If he played Chelsea we would be in that list right
Ask Roma that was omitted
The anti Ancelotti
You mean the anti Simeone because 90 of those are vs Atleti
And I was on that red game vs Bayern But it was a great night for party in Munich
Slightly more accurate version WINS LOSSES 4 3 Agg Paris St Germain 1 3 vs Real Madrid 5 4 Agg Atl tico Madrid 1 0 Atl tico Madrid 3 2 Agg Manchester CIty 2 1 Real Madrid 5 1 Agg Paris St Germain 5 3 Agg Bayern Munich 0 1 Atl tico Madrid 3 1 Juventus 0 4 Real Madrid 2 1 Atl tico Madrid
He likes to play Atletico doesn t he
Honestly this is phenomenal
At first I read this as Jose Enrique don t ask me why and I was really curious
hmm where are his stats for his Roma days LOL
Do one for Wenger
If you re wondering there are so many Barca related stats its because this group of barca fanatics keeps churning them out https twitter com G14 en
Celtic 2 1 Barcelona How could you leave that one out
Its funny how little games against top teams barca have compared to the PL where a team would have loads of big games a season
Considering this doesn t include Villereal Valencia Celta Vigo and Athletic Bilbao all of whom would have beaten everyone in the Premier League bar Chelsea and potentially Man City I think it s rash to assume that this list alone means that Barcelona play less big games than they would do if they were in the PremGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
he spends the whole interview looking like hes waiting for one of those kids to ask him to the prom
I comes from a family that loved football Our translator is killing it
yo venir equipo de futbol muchos gracias
Haha indeed Una familia la qual eh no les gustaba mucho el futbol Family that loves football NAILED IT
See my comment just above He says Vengo de una familia a la cual nos gustaba mucho el f tbol a todos That his family did love football
Not only that I think he says he comes from a family that generally did not like football Only his older brother did and so he would go play alone I have trouble with his accent though so not sure
He says Vengo de una familia a la cual nos gustaba mucho el f tbol a todos but he swallows the s That is that everyone in his family already liked football and he had an older brother who was already playing organized football
Ahh makes sense Thanks
Messi to La Masia confirmed This transfer deadline day is going crazy
Fuck How are we supposed to replace him
promoting him back to the first team
phew that was close
WE DID IT r soccer
He s just like a kid himself
ffs give the man a jacket
and the boys too
Yeah looks like they were all freezing
even their voices were trembling
Loved this interview The first two kids were really nervous haha
If you were sat across from the best footballer in the world at age 10 im sure you d shit yourself too
And knowing you re being recorded as well
Hell Messi seems really nervous Is this dude going to ever not be awkward
he s so fucking awkward the kids are all scared shitless but messi can t look anyone in the eye must be shitty having these heart to hearts with 45 cameras around the table and kids reading written questions
I actually think he has gotten a lot better at this kind of stuff He used to be extremely awkward to the point of almost Autistic Now he seems more composed but still slightly Messi awkward I think that its his way of avoiding too much attention that could make him arrogant If he was to truly see how much people thought of him he may feel that it will effect his play
He gave a sort of revealing for him interview when he was quite young and he mentioned that he felt it was very noticeable how small he was as a kid before he had the hormone treatments he said wherever he went it drew attention I always assumed that growing up being subject to so much of the wrong type of attention made him very shy and wary of being the focus of it even as an adult But I agree in the past year or so he seems more over it When he got the Ballon d Or I was bracing myself for another awkward Messi moment where he mumbles something about how it s all about the team and he doesn t like individual awards but thanks anyway He was pretty poised and gracious about it this time
He has aspergers which explains that also explains his natural gift in football
This is an urban myth alas He s just very reserved
Was about to ask There s no actual evidence then
I m embarrassed to say I actually did some research on this trying to track down any actual evidence There was just one article in Portuguese it all came from It was terribly written and had no sources and was years old Interestingly I believe what made the information semi viral was a relatively ancient Reddit post on a non football subreddit that translated it All other references go back either to the article itself or that post
no he doesn t People on the internet assuming he s autistic because he s introverted awkward is not a medical diagnosis and the popular belief that autistic people are all super geniuses in one thing is bs as well Did you guys all watch Rain Man and come up with that conclusion I have a relative who is autistic and believe me we just hope for him to lead a normal life
This is such a stupid rumor What basis do you or anyone else have for knowing he s aspergers Are you or anyone in the media privy to his medical history Or do you just base it off of the fact he s an awkward guy in front of the camera If you were to have a look at most people I m sure you would find that there are plenty of people who act just like Messi and shy away from the spotlight when its put their way Doesn t make them aspergers Don t be ignorant
Feels like he s a lot more open to the questions he usually hides from when he s speaking to the kids rather than journalists etc
because journalists seek to twist your words and make you sound like a bad guy while your fellow players seek to get better
Wow he still get s emotional when he talks about leaving Argentina Coincidentally Sport just published a picture of Leo supposedly on the day he arrived at Barcelona For those who were confused with the translated interview when he said that he missed his family but he lived with his parents while at La Masia he actually only said he lived with his father the rest of his family were in Argentina
I think he says he lived with his parents but as he speaks with this Argentinian accent it sounds like he only says father viv a con mih padreh 3 36
iirc from his biography he had both his parents with him in his first year in Barcelona but after that his mother moved back to Argentina because his younger sibling was still attending school there so he was living mainly with his dad when he was at la masia
Where do you keep your Ballon D or Just in the cabinet with the other four no big deal
Aw man I like this guy For native Spanish speakers or Catalan speakers how was Messi s Spanish here Was it still very thick with Argentinian accent or were they all speaking Catalan and so was Messi or how was it really I ve read various times on this sub that Messi doesn t speak Catalan in interviews he sticks to Spanish with his thick Argentinian accent but I d reckon he d try to make himself clear for these kids I m not saying they re stupid so they understand and it is a smooth chat
It was definitely Spanish and Messi sounds quintessentially Argentine still Lots of SH sounds for starters
Cheers
Sheers
No worries mate
Can you give me an example of when he uses an sh sound and how that is different from what would typically be heard in the Spanish spoken in Spain Thanks
y and ll in Argentine Spanish are pronounced sh So yo sounds like sho and amarillo rather than amariyo sounds like amarisho
Wow I never knew that I guess that would pretty clearly identify you as an Argentine Ha It s so distinctive
does messi know Catalan how different is it from spanish
You can sort of understand some parts especially when you are reading Catalan but it is still a different language Maybe people who know both french and spanish can understand it better than I can
They were all speaking Spanish not a hint of Catalan His accent sounds pretty thick to me maybe it was thicker when he was younger but it still pretty easy to tell he s from Argentina
Thank you have a good one
It hasn t changed a bit His argentine accent is still as thick as when he was here For the kids though they are speaking spanish aswell its normal for people in Catalunya for Spanish to be their first language Jordi Alba for example he didnt really speak catalan when he was in our youths but he does now Xavi is an example of the other way around he learned spanish later on I havent seen Messi speak catalan but he understands it perfectly
He speaks Catalan when he is a drunk P
Thanks for the info mate
Xavi s father is from Almeria I really doubt that he didn t speak Spanish since he was a child
I m basing this on an old interview He struggled to reply in spanish and he said I m getting better and laughed Unfortunately I couldn t find the video
I think Messi speaks little Catalan He doesn t speak it in the video and his accent is noticeable but not ridiculously prominent
when he s drunk he can say VISCA EL BAR A I VISCA CATALUNYA
Alright mate Thanks
this is my favorite stereotypical Argentine accent lol you can see Messi s is not so strong
I ll have a look when I can thank you
Pretty much every Catalonian I ve met and all the younger ones speak both Castilian Spanish and Catalan
Correct Whatever they re all Spainian anyways P
Ah ok Thank you
Really liked his answer to the first question the captain of U19 asked him I didn t expect him to acknowledge it so easily
It s true in the past he has always dodged the question by saying he doesn t think of himself that way and there are so many good players it s impossible to say who is the best He still manages to answer it without saying whether or not he agrees with the assessment though It was a well phrased question that way how does it feel when people say X is not the same as how does it feel to be X
Which was on mobile so I cannot view it atm
Roughly from memory Q How does it feel to be regarded as the greatest player of all times by many A Honestly it feels amazing that people think and say that It makes me proud But I try not to think about it and focus on my daily work
i think about it all the time it feels like im god and Ronaldo is sheit compared to me
deleted
It s a joke chill
deleted
you re worse than the shitty memes
So you re saying if his joke were a footballer it d be Ronaldo
I legit thought that was Dani Alves next to him the whole time until he started talking
Looked like Alves was the muscle in case the kids got too rowdy
10 years from now when one of these kids is a superstar this is going to be the subject of an r soccer post that will get lots of karma
RemindMe 22 Years
I use to start every sentence with La verdad que to make it sound like I knew more spanish than I did but it always sounded weird to me
Messi is such a stand up guy the kids at la masia have an amazing role model to look up to I wonder if Ronaldo did something with the captains of the RM Jr Sides and whether he was as respectful as Messi
I d say Ramos more than Ronaldo
nah more like Iker since he actually came from Madrid s academy I don t think Ramos or Ronaldo would have much to say about the experience of attending La F brica
Great watch but i think they may have wanted to do this indoors I felt cold just watching this
Love the reaction to the best player of all time question Didn t even pretend to be humble and just took it in his stride
Messi couldn t see his family much when he was younger BibleThump
watching that made me cold
Shh you are interrupting the Ronaldo circle jerk that s going on at the moment He scored another hat trick against the mighty espanyol don t you know
Grow up fan boy
This is scripted
Imagine La Masia to be like Naruto great players today becoming great coaches tomorrow Cruyff Guardiola Luis Enrique Blanc Koeman De Boer Neymar is Gaara who fought Naruto and became friends afterwards
What
I see neymar as more of a squirtle
Damn weebs
Naruto might be mainstream but jeez dude there isn t that much of an overlap between r soccer and r naruto But even for me who knows the show No it s not like that at all Neymar didn t really have a problem with Messi at all nor was he a negative character Messi never fucked up the way Naruto did at all If you really want an anime analogy he s more like Goku Un fucking touchable all powerful alien like Right when you think you caught up to him he is miles ahead of you
Mate the only anime DBZ analogy in football is the Goku Vegeta being Messi Ronaldo respectively
He has like no personality at all it s almost inhuman

Starting to become City s development club I d rather develop our own players to be honest but at least this kid seems decent
And you ll also have him for 18 months giving him enough time to settle in and hopefully do well for you
Get him on the Irn Bru and Haggis and it might make the deal permanent
Exactly he ll still be about to play a role in Celtic s qualifiers Plus I don t know much about him but if he can play where Armstrong is on the field it s a no brainier needs a kick up the butt
The kid might be the next Leo Mess in my book Maybe not as good but certainly play style
You don t just call a player the next Leo Messi
He didn t he just said the kid would be a mess
No he didn t he said the next Mess not a Mess The joke doesn t even work because you used a instead of the
I wouldn t call him the next Messi but he is exceptionally talented The way he plays is also a bit akin to Messi He s got amazing dribbling along with the low CG and a mean left foot The resident scout u discopopshop posted a clip of him where he pointed out he d never seen someone move their feet so quickly Then again thousands of next Messi s have come never to be heard of again
He didn t to be fair He called him the next Leo Mess Whatever that means
I mean he probably will be as good as him maybe he won t be though
Let the boy be his own fucking player
Hope he s better than Tyler Blackett
Good move for both parties in my opinion Talented player who needs consistent matches and he ll go to a club that expects success every time they step on the pitch just like City do Very technical player and I think he ll do well in Scotland
Aren t Celtic more stacked with wingers than the Spanish national team are with midfielders
It s not as much we have out and out wingers as it is Deila going on a rampage of playing anyone who can kick a ball as a wide attacking midfielder
Even the keeper
Only a matter of time
To be fair we only have 2 actual wingers Mackay Steven and Forrest On the other hand we have a million attacking midfielders who occupy the 3 positions behind the striker Armstrong Commons Rogic Christie Allan Johansen Henderson MacGregor Ciftci Stokes I feel like I m forgetting people as well That is 11 first team players who can occupy the 3 positions behind the striker Fucking swimming in them man Can t believe we are signing a wee guy on loan
Ciftci just got loaned out
Borreigter as well
Hard to count him didn t he pick up a red card in one of the first games last season and not played at all since
I didn t count him because he is not a first team player he isn t even a benchwarmer The man is a disgrace
Stokes is gone
On loan
And ciftci
Well I hope he gets some game time he has serious quality but can t handle well with the physical aspect of the game
Henderson and Allan dont get played as AM
Aye they do They don t play holding midfielder so in Celtic s team they get played as AM behind the striker
Pat is excellent You ll love him
Can he play centre half
You had Denayer
The major highlight of this window has been Sviatckenko everything else has been utter dross Look guys we have another left sided winger attacking midfielder FUCKING YAS
Roberts best position is on the right wing I don t know who you already have there though so that may be no better
GMS Forrest Commons Armstrong Rogic Christie Allan McGregor Boerrigter Split that group down the middle that s 4 players on each flank We need to get rid of about half of them and not bring in more
How good is sviatckenko
Can t be sure just yet but the sounds are all very positive about him unlike this Turkish guy we are signing from Feyenord and the fact that we have about 100 players who play in Patrick Roberts position
Yeah enjoy Kazim he s shit at everything Only thing he s good at is sturring up the opposition
Hope we don t actually sign him then
Just what I like to hear We haven t had enough provocative players lately
Sadly no one to play in Efe s position
Eh Sviatchenko Him and Simunovic are a likely starting pair
Well obviously Sviatchenko only joined the club Simunovic is the Jack Wilshere of Scottish football Need a youth player like KT at centre half though
Kazim Richards Blades legend
We don t really have a left sided winger though
You called But seriously Gary Mackay Steven and Forrest can both play on the left they just both play better on the right Personally I think Armstrong will only improve in the position he s been hampered a lot by injuries this season but if he gets fit then he should be allowed to develop in the role
GMS isnt good enough Forrest is injury prone and Armstrong is gash atm That leaves you McGregor who is also below average at best Forrest is the only one good enough to actually play against bigger teams in Europe This is a needed signing in my opinion Now if this was a striker then I might be on your side
So you re saying that signing another meh player who we only have for a short time is a needed signing If we signed a player that was definite first team material with potential then I would agree with you but GMS Forrest and Armstrong are all first team players with great potential If your point is that they aren t good enough then it doesn t make sense to bring in another player who might be alright but then will leave as soon as they get settled
Somebody noted at r MCFC a couple days ago when this rumor started that we like sending players to Celtic so that they can experience playing in a dominant side Similar system where they can experience having more control over a game 50 possession etc is more akin to how they d be playing at City instead of a bottom table PL or Championship side
Also get a chance playing in a side that forces in as many 10s as possible to be ready for City s style of play
Oof Good move for everyone involved
We seem to be building up a decent relationship with Man City but I hope this doesn t end with us being a development club for themGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
Has he cut his ridiculous wage bonus demands or have you guys caved in to them
Apparently he fired his agent and agreed our original offer
That s some Football Manager shit right there
lol rekt
The former Both parties were happy with the original deal but then those ridiculous add ons were added on and that led to us pulling out Apparently he was offered to the original deal again and this time choose to accept it
Similar to what we had with Clarke when we were gonna appoint him as manager then You got your man a few days later we waited a few months to get ours And it was a different man
He cut his ridiculous wage bonus demands He figured he could get Steve Gibson to go for way more but when he got a nice solid firm no read fuck you for being unreasonable he must have realized that Blackburn where ready to rebuild from the money from him and that he could be in a better team for his future
I imagine the announcement from both clubs that talks were starting probably made him think he could basically ask for whatever he wanted and get it Good to see a club not giving in to that sort of shit Even better if it means we get to keep McCormack p

Such a hypocrite Burnley have spent 15m this window and are going to sign Tarkowski for another 3m
hue
Hippo Crate Well done lads we showed him a variety of Hippo Crates good work
He ll never make that mistake again Images of hippos in crates are going to haunt his dreams for the next month
Fuck me I m an idiot
HIPPO CRATE
Not to mention they also bought Gray off us for 9mill last window
To be fair a lot of these transfers are using money from their Premier League season They will have gotten quite a bit through parachute payments and TV money which they barely spent whilst up here And they didn t exactly spend money in their promotion season either
We also sold Trippier and Shackell for a combined 6 5 million plus the tribunal fee for Danny Ings expected to be 10 12 million so it s not as if we ve spent beyond our means But i guess perspective isn t that important in the minds of narrative obsessed football fans
I don t really have a problem with clubs buying and selling for large amounts but the way Burnley have gone about this transfer window specifically dealing with Brentford has annoyed me Bidding for our best players days before we played eachother isn t very sportsmanlike imo Obviously I don t know the inner workings of clubs bidding but could at least waited a few more days to re bid for them to not throw off players or pressure the club e also the fact that whenever someone mentions that Burnley spend big or are about to to Dyche he says that Burnley don t have a big budget and won t spend a lot
Other clubs were bidding for those players and Burnley had a bid for Tarkowski rejected on Jan 4th 9 days before the Brentford game You can t honestly expect a club to avoid bidding for players they want while other clubs are also bidding just because they play each other soon
I can t expect it to never happen but it still annoys me Burnley bid for Tarks on Jan 4th but then if I m remembering correctly they tried again a couple days before the game at which point Tarks asked not to play And yeah other clubs were bidding for Judge as well but not right before we played them It s a lot harder for a player to play against the team who are bidding for them
Perhaps I m thinking too much about ethics or something but I don t think it s that absurd for a club to hold off for a couple more days so that both clubs can play the match at 100 The rumoured bid at the time was still quite low ball as well it was about 2mill knowing full well that we wouldn t accept anything under the 4mill valuation but would be enough to rattle the player In all honesty it probably wouldn t have mattered if Tarks was playing or not we would ve probably still lost but at least the team would be playing at full strength
Taking the piss out of Dyche who kept on complaining about the so called Market leaders and how Burnley couldn t compete financially with other clubs
He s blowing our trumpet and it deserves to be blown Burnley fans are proud that our club is run properly and we re not ashamed of talking about it I understand if you dislike the fact that Burnley fans look down on Derby we wouldn t like it either if the league positions were reversed
Fuck you man Middlesbrough has been run like a fortress under Gibson since he became chairman The man is literally known for being a good chairman
Sure He s fine I have nothing against him But Burnley s run even better We should have been relegated to the third tier over a decade ago after the ITV digital collapse but while much bigger clubs went into admin we hired the perfect manager for the time bought and sold brilliantly and survived despite being favourites for relegation 3 or 4 years in a row I m sure Boro has had it s troubles being a Premiership yoyo team for most of the 00 s but they ve not gone through what Burnley had to and come out the other end
You actually don t know what you re talking about Check when he saved us from liquidation in 1986 and the stability we ve had since How the team achieved two successive promotions from the old third division to the first division the following years How under his stewardship we won the league cup and made it to the final of the UEFA Cup When he signed brilliant players such as Mendieta Emerson Juninho and Ravanelli How he became known in the media for being a brilliant chairmen due to his patient and thoughtful approach not sacking managers immediately and putting so much of his money into the club The man IS Middlesbrough FC And Premier league yoyo team in the 00 s You really must have no idea what you re talking about because we were in the premier league for 11 consecutive years from 1998 to 2009 we weren t relegated for the absolute majority of the 00 s So when you say we didn t go through anything like your club actually check because we practically went though exactly what your club went through and came out of it better you clown
Both our clubs our run really well mate but Dyche is a bit of a prat for going around and complaining about other clubs in the Championship spending and the goes and spends 20m over the 2 windows
Where you getting 20 million from I don t even think we ve spent that in Euros and that s including Tarkowski And you re clearly not including all the transfer fees received because after the Ings tribunal our net spend will likely end up being well short of 5 million in both windows Edit In fact we ll probably be net positive 4 4 mil net last window 3 mil this window And Ing will get us upwards of 10 mil http www transferleague co uk burnley english football teams burnely transfers Edit 2 Oh boy I ve just seen Derby s spending this season 26 million net transfer spend Ouch http www transferleague co uk derby county english football teams derby county transfers

I doubt we re paying 6 million but regardless you re not including the transfer fees received which is a pretty important thing to consider It s intellectually dishonest to know a team loses 15 20 million the Danny Ings fee isn t included in your link in players transferred out and then calling them hypocrites for using that money to replace those players who are sold Especially if according to the source you cite your club has spent 23 84m and received exactly 0 in transfer fees
He blamed us signing McCormack as one of the reasons Burnley struggled to sign players in the Premiership he s been doing this shit for a while now
On whom have we spent this 15 million
15 million THIS window We ve only bought James Tarkowski
I m wondering if the Rams fan is mistaking Boro s spend in the last window with ours in this window http uk soccerway com teams england middlesbrough football club 671 transfers
We ve spent like 6 million on Gray 3 on Tarkowski wages on Barton 1 5 2 on Hennings Few hundred grand on Long 1 on Lowton 600k on Darikwa And that s since the START OF THE SEASON
And received 6 5 million for Shacks and Tripps plus the fee for Ings eventually
Alright Imploding Turtle We know
I love how Dyche is getting under the skin of our rivals simply by pointing out we ve only spent money we ve recouped in outgoing transfers Boro and Derby fans going mental every time Dyche is interviewed and that question is asked of him which is every time nowadays the press must know the reaction his comments elicit
Because why does he need to mention it It s just sour grapes from the guy used to like him but he needs to focus on his own club

Nice Relegate Blackburn and spunk your transfer budget on a player that is about 50 50 to actually perform for you I d offer a thumbs up too That said I ve had a real soft spot for Boro since the mid 90s from my time living in Aycliffe so i hope you win the playoffs
Derby are far more likely to cave under pressure near the end of this season than Boro are I m still really uncertain about the top 2 between Boro Hull Derby and yourselves but rest assured none of those 4 teams are anywhere near safe Just makes it all the more difficult for teams like ourselves trying to go the playoffs route
I think in terms of FFP and long term finances Burnley are the only one of the four who could afford to not get promoted this season or next
Goodbye sweet prince
And now for De Laet and then done
Better De Laet than never
Don t fuck with Gibbo and King Karanka This is Walter White in the desert style psychology
Such a huge disparity in this league We can hardly stump up a million for a player but teams are going into 8 figures Somehow were midtable
If you re near the top it s worth the gamble of PL money to spend big and hope for at most a frown from the FL if when you go up FFP is honestly a bit ridiculous balances and checks are needed but the ones in place now just seem foolish
Ha 1 million Rich bastards Over the last three seasons I think we ve spent about 500k total and most of that 350k ish on one player Knudsen at the start of this season This despite selling Cresswell and Mings for a combined 12 million plus add ons
Haha we spent almost a million on a forward in the summer and he naffed his knee so he s our for 7 months Ipswich are great though always do well without overspending Plus Mick is always a laugh wouldn t mind him as a manager
Can t believ championship teams are now buying and selling for 10 mil plus That s madness must be the only 2nd division league in the world that does that
That s what the new PL money does Succeed and you get a boatload of money and no worries about an embargo even if you go down again you can do a QPR and just say you won t pay the fine and the FL will seemingly do cock all about it Fail and eh try again the next window that you re allowed to
It s sad we get mugged off all the time by foreign teams all we sign are European rejects are biggest signings are Real Madrid and Barcelona rejects
If you re gonna complain about the struggles of signing Fabregas and Pedro you ll find zero sympathy here p Also Courtois Costa Oscar Hazard Willian Azpilicueta Zouma are hardly rejects or signings where you ve been mugged off
I never said that I said the leagues biggest signings have been European rejects ozil Sanchez di Maria etc That s why we struggle against the bigger teams in Europe That s all I said dude
Ah thought the we referred to you guys p It s what happens when there s so much money floating about Liverpool and Man Utd are the only teams with a name history to rival the Reals Bayerns and Barcas yet they ve either been largely unsuccessful of late and or don t have a particularly safe positive image at the moment Our biggest teams are absolutely second rate in the world game yet the PL teams down to mid table at the very least have top rate finances
It s sad man but hopefully with these huge managers coming it ll attract the big players again
Seriously though I think the signings we ve made in this transfer window are going to make sure we go up Gaston Ramirez and Jordan Rhodes are great signings for a team fighting for promotion to the EPL The goals were hard to come by sometimes for us with this we should have that sorted
Yep Rhodes more so than Ramirez Worried for us now
When this goes through its the biggest transfer fee of this window across Europe at 13m
I thought it was 9m upfront
SS just said 11m and ITV said 13m I thought it was 9m as well so i guess we wont know till something official comes out
Sky are guilty of including add ons in the fee they report did it with McCormack too

Let s be real he ll be injured by end of day Thursday
Thursday Try Wednesday
Sources say he has just injured himself again when going through the drive thru at maccys
You optimist
This just is he dislocated his thumb while tying his shoes this morning that s another 3 weeks folks
Like a new signing
Klopp actually said These are our new signings about the 4 players returning this week
Klopp would get so many upvotes as an r soccer user
What is a Daniel Sturridge
I believe its an old old wooden ship
Sounds brittle
Better hope this weather passes
Can we bubble wrap him and lock him away till Wembley please
Sturridge future career move Even that might not be safe sign he might pull a hammy or a quad
If he was wearing that he d come out with a shoulder injury
Then suffocate
Lig a ments are breaking down Jur gen Klopp just stops and frowns It s on ly Thursdaaaaa a aay
God what is that song Have the tune in my head now

Colonel bagshot six day war remember hearing a remix of it Can t find it now Thanks
Definitely goes to the tune of hella o s
Philippe Coutinho Divock Origi Thursday Martin Skrtel Sunday are all set to return to full training this week too Joe Gomez Danny Ings both out for the season could be Liverpool s only injured players come this time next week
What s Rossiter up to then
Idk he was supposed to be back by now and someone said they saw him in the training photos but then I heard last week that he s still a few weeks away He s barely first team though so I thought I could get away with excluding him haha
You d probably get quite a lot of results if you typed in Daniel Sturridge to return to full training in the search bar
Maybe he should just take the rest of the season off and heal properly
If he gets injured again I think that might become a possibility tbf
If he gets injured again he s better off going to MNF and starting a new career
Who is he Will he manage to play one match Joke aside I wish him all the best finally Liverpool needs him badly
Always a more dangerous team when he s playing
Next Wednesday Daniel Sturridge injured in training after falling over grass
God damn it now I m full of optimism again dangerous territory
Nope not going to believe it or get my hopes up
You know I m usually a cynical fucker like the rest of you but this asshole gets my hopes every damned time
I do hope he actually manages to stay healthy for a while
Does a while express in hours or minutes
Seconds
Calm down Mr Optimism
A couple games would be a good start
For how long
I hate to see a talent like that wasted away by injuries
I ll believe it when I see it
Sturridge to be injured by Thursday
Injured by lunchtime
Crocked by friday
What do I have to do so he won t hurt himself again I will do anything Please
Klopp should remove his life supplier by now
Hearing reports he stubbed his toe on the way into the facility and is out for another 2 3 weeks
Is there a recall for him
inb4 kicks ball hamstring injury and is sidelined for six months
C mon boys Let s place the bets I say he last 15 minutes in a match and I m being very kind
No he s not lol
Thanks for the update Klopp
There s a video on LFC s fb with Klopp explicitly stating this
Fingers crossed he has a decent showing the next few months so we can offload him over the summer Maybe sell him to Villa as revenge for Benteke
Yeah lets sell our only world class player to a Championship team after he has a decent few months
World class He s missed over 75 of our games He s a liability
How long do you honestly think he ll stay healthy How long do you think it will take to get back to his world class form Mind you this is a guy who Gerrard he had convince to even show up for the United game He is as weak mentally as he is physically Sturridge is a liability pure and simply and if we ever give him a new contract the only way it d be a good move is if it was heavily dependent on appearances and performance Paying him close to 175 000 a week to miss games is embarrassing and shit business Again we signed him 1 125 days ago and he s been injured for 418 of them That s 38 of the days we ve had him he s been injured 75 games and counting
lol the fact that you re calling your most developed player a liability is absolutely stupid then again what would you expect from someone who says Sturridge s wages get paid in dollars back your players you flag waving plastic hahaha I would take him in a heartbeat at arsenal he d fit right in too
yes but you don t sell a world class player who doesn t want to leave you back your players who put the effort in sturridge wouldn t have been where he is now without a lot of grinding and improving himself but why am I trying to explain loyalty to an american anyway
What effort He s been on his ass injured Pay me his weekly wages and I ll give just as much effort as him Should they sign me I ve scored exactly as many goals for Liverpool as he has in the past 4 months
wilshere gets paid around 90k p w and he s been injured for six months the point is when you have talent you don t squander it to someone else luckily for Liverpool their transfer committee is mildly less retarded than you
That would be four goals You re doing alright
Honestly Sturridge Flani Alves
I get the sentiment of this statement but we DO have coutinho
Coutinho isn t world class I don t even think he s better than Henderson across a whole season
Are you serious Coutinho is easily one of the best if not the best player on our team as well as one of the best midfielders in the league And in a few years he will be one of the best in the world He s much better than hendo
When he turns up yeah sure but that s happened about 3 times so far this season He s incredibly inconsistent and frequently invisible in games
So is Bale better than Ronaldo cause Ronaldo doesn t turn up every game
How is that the same Coutinho has played well 3 times in 20 appearances Ronaldo has scored like 30 goals this season
I can t even put the effort in this anymore you re actually arguing Henderson is better than Coutinho lol I would ask what constitutes a good performance but you d probably say scoring so I m not even going to try
That s literally the exact opposite of what I d say Coutinho gets away with poor average performances because he scores a screamer every now and then whereas Henderson is consistently one of our best players on the pitch all round Don t get me wrong Coutinho would be better if he improved his consistency He s unplayable at his best he just doesn t show it anywhere near enough
Henderson is by far better performer for Liverpool than Coutinho He is very consistentGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
Good way to further alienate the local fanbase by outpricing them
Also it is easier to buy tickets via Thomas Cook than the ticket office
clubs dont care about the local fanbase the local fanbase dont give them the money the local fanbase dont pay the players wages the local fanbase dont provide the funds for new transfers thats what the fans in asia and the gloryhunters who live in other parts of the country pay for those are the people the club care about
TIL Arsenal cares about me TAKE THAT DAD

What the fuck
Is there a correlation between number of foreigners at a game and ticket prices Iirc the numbers on foreign fans were released for last year or something and they are close to around 15 of match day tickets only
Shameful With the new TV deal is it totally naive to think clubs might introduce a freeze for a year or two
no thats not how capitalism works
A part of me likes to think that the full stadiums and atmosphere are what makes the leagues such a marketable TV product But well until the seats start going empty
The seats won t go empty The atmosphere will disappear though as it has at the other big stadiums I went to old trafford and emirates last season was like being at a funeral at both except the away ends
High ticket prices drives out the sort of fans that make the noise in the greater scheme of things match day ticket revenue can t be that much of a boost to Premier League teams I doubt there d be any repercussions from chopping a tenner off the price Turns out I am horribly catastrophically wrong and match day revenue still makes up a huge percentage of a clubs revenue
Fair point I guess I just probably falsely assumed match day revenue was insignificant compared to a top Premier League club s other revenue streams
Maybe in the future when broadcasting and sponsorship money dwarf match day revenue but definitely not for now
Arsenal have the highest matchday revenue in the world at about 100m pretty much a third of their total revenue With the new TV deal in place that number will go down a bit but 25 is still a massive piece of the pie
matchday revenues make up a huge part of revenue a tenner x the average attendance of the emirates x the number of matches arsenal play roughly 50 million pounds so you can either have a tenner off or you can have ozil
That d be nowhere near 50 million pounds Rounding the capacity to 60 000 and assuming Arsenal play about 30 home games a season 19 in the Prem 4 in the CL and seven in both cup competitions and a tenner off you d end up at about 18 million that s lost or not even five percent of their matchday revenue close to 20 of their matchday revenue That decrease is more than made up in the form of the new TV contract though so Arsenal could indeed easily cut ticket prices and make up the difference elsewhere
ah alright so its a tenner off or sanchez
It s not an either or type of thing though
why on earth would they give up 20 million though thats 20 million out of their transfer budget for really no good reason than to make some fans in london happier for a season
I can t say I know much about football economics I just assumed that for top Premier League teams who are on TV every week TV money Champions League money prize money and other international revenue would far outweigh actual match day revenue Might well be wrong though
http www businessofsoccer com 2014 02 18 how do soccer clubs make money
Thanks didn t realise how wrong I was
The atmosphere has long gone
Capitalism is evil but unfortunately a necessary evil Fuck shit cunt SocialDemocracyTillICry
It is possible to have social democracy which puts regulations subsidizes on sports to allow people to attend
making the taxpayer pay for sports teams is a godawful idea that they do in handegg
I agree but it is possible that the market gets restrained e g some people like how the MLS has salary caps
er im not sure how salary caps relate to ticket subsidies
i see the difference is that salary caps are league enforced subsidies would be government enforced so one is paid for by public money the other isnt ive got no issue with the former but i think the latter is a terrible idea
Yes yes I understand that but it is possible for a government to enforce something like salary caps and that would be compatible with how a lot of social democratic theory
They re already so expensive IIRC they re the highest priced outside London
And they wonder why the Kop sounds like a fucking graveyard
Shameful
Customers not supporters and all that I wonder if there ll ever be a day when season ticket holders at all clubs just say this is enough
Aren t there waiting lists for season tickets at some clubs It won t end ever They ll keep justifying it People will keep paying it
How much is a ticket to see Liverpool compared to Arsenal or Chelsea In U S American football games are 60 150 55 140 euros depending on location of your seat
Wankers
Q Can the atmosphere really get worse than it already is
I think Liverpool s season ticket is already the most expensive per game in the league how can they possibly justify increasing the price just after expanding the stadium
Paying off the expansion
if theyre still selling out theyre not pricing the tickets high enough
That s what we were waiting for on Transfer deadline day So all we got is Caulker and higher ticket prices
Grujic
Great that he can play Oh no we loaned him back
And they ve announced it on deadline day where it ll get as little press as possible Not on tbh Prize freeze at the least
unless i m misreading this wasn t the club s announcement but the supporter group s The supporter group has indicated the prices will be announced later this week I can t imagine the club has any control over when the supporter group made their announcement
Yeah that s what I meant sorry wasn t very clear It s a bad time for it Not on what they re doing though
Diabolical Where is the TV money going
Klopp s glasses replacements
Things like benteke carroll markovic lovren etc
Glad to see being the ninth richest club in the world is really helpful to fans
It s really okay though Jurgen and the lads might pour out a few beers
Yeah they ll have a couple of their most humble butlers pour out a few bottles of Johnny Walker Blue Label or possibly even a few of their 1998 Vintage Dom Perignon Behind closed doors I m sure the owners denounce with fervent disgust the ghastly situation whereby some of the common folk have the audacity to intermingle with the right sort of footballing crowd
Yeah that s what they need an even worse atmosphere
Well this is shit With the amount all teams get from the TV deals now you would think all the ticket prices would be dirt cheap But greedy people have to be greedy I guess
Am I missing something or does it not actually say that ticket prices are going to rise next season It just says that the group s proposal which called for a reduction has not been met It does mention price rises but doesn t say when these are to take effect
what was the practical way the supporters groups were proposing for keeping tickets out of the hands of resellers I mean ok I understand the desire to have local fans go but if you sell a local fan a ticket for 50 when the market price is 100 I think it s only fair you have a way for preventing resale Otherwise you re just making ticket brokers rich Also the supporter groups demand for no match categorizations which I assume means EPL match vs ManU is priced the same as League Cup vs Stevenage is ridiculous and makes me wonder how much of the rest of their proposal is ridiculous
Removing match categorisation isn t ridiculous And I am sure league cup games are priced differently to league games so your example is irrelevant
Disappointing on one hand but not really surprising with the building of the stands
I thought they were planning on having cheaper seats once the new stand is built
This wont go down well at all
Need to pay for the new stadium of course

I mean it isn t a good stat for him or Madrid but it s actually pretty insane interesting that he s scored nearly half of his 20 goals against two teams
It s kinda stupid with Real Madrid fans though You don t score enough You suck You score a lot It s not in the proportion I want I want you out you suck
When you have the second best player in the world yes it s my opinion let s not argue you kind of expect them to have more of an impact in important matches I realize it sounds spoiled but it s a bit frustrating when he can put in a total of 8 in already done and dusted matches against Espanyol but none against Betis where we dropped points Though personally I don t want him out can t speak for other Madridistas
It s not spoiled at all But in defense of Ronaldo The team a lot of the time as a whole doesn t really perform in bigger matches I m kinda curious what they ll start doing vs some of the stronger teams after Zidane has been there for awhile
I guess I just wish that a player of his caliber would be able to make an impact even if the team were playing poorly But I definitely agree the entire team has trouble showing up for big matches Fingers crossed Zidane can change that mentality
I feel for him though Must suck to play with that knee and know you ve had such an amazing career with strong play and now lack the accuracy Although weirdly enough he scored like 3 beautiful goals in a short period of time
I love Ronaldo and it makes me happy when he is happy I do agree with the opinion and I do wish he had a little more impact this season when we are playing badly But in his defence a lot of times games like the one against Real Sociedad where he changed the course of the game single handedly especially when we are in danger gets overlooked
totally agree Schalke and Sevilla from last season immediately come to mind
That s not spoiled at all You expect your star players in this case superstar to have big impacts in important games If they score 2 3 4 goals against games that would always be a win but not score in the games where you draw or lose then he s not delivering simply as that
betis is an important match i m pretty sure if he had scored there it d be grouped among the bottom half relegation threatened clubs that fell victim to the flat track bully
Well it was important in the sense that Madrid couldn t afford to drop points from it But they did I see what you mean though my logic isn t totally sound
Every game immediately after Barca dropped points is kinda important We always slip up when they do so in a way Betis was an important game
heh such is the life of a Madrid fan I suppose
It s important to bang those extra goals in because you don t want them to have the chance to get back in and saved you energy in defense for later games
yep Real Mad s fanbase is the shittest in Spain I may be a little bit biased though
The problem is scoring in games which you ve already won is much easier than scoring in games when you need to score either you re drawing or behind Teams can afford to be defensive if they re ahead or if they re taking a point off of Madrid so breaking them down is much harder and as such way more important for your main goalscorer to be scoring in those games
Browsing new after Ronaldo has a decent game is always fun
Surprisingly this comes from a Real Madrid fan this time around
It s not surprising A lot of fans want him to be sold what s the point of scoring 5 against Espanyol when you disappear against all the big teams Seriously go check out r realmadrid and see what their opinions were on Ronaldo before today s game
you are so correct I think the same thing but when I try to argue they tell me he has so many goals doe
Ronaldo isn t the only one who disappears during big games What is ronaldo supposed to do if they can t even pass him the ball
Don t ask me ask the your fellow Madridstas Especially at the Betis post match thread https np reddit com r realmadrid comments 42ht7r postmatch thread real betis vs real madrid
Man I yell at those dudes constantly for being spoiled Jose and Ronaldo deserve statues for bringing this team back to being a feared team Our midfield has so many issues Modric is the only player right now who belongs He pretty much does everything
Dirty tactics I guess He had a pretty unfavorable record against Barcelona during his stint there as well
I doubt he meant actual literal fear of physically getting the shit kicked out of you But that s only because the poster had Real Madrid flair so he wouldn t admit that
He returned us to Europe after Pellegrini and numerous other coaches had embarrassing exits in the ro16 and QF He won us our first Copa against Barcelona no less after not winning a Copa in what 20 years He won the league He built the team that won La Decima
Maybe he meant in all competitions
Get the ball At least that s what Messi does
Messi plays a deeper position than ronaldo
Because Messi is able to do that Ronaldo isn t No hate but that s true
I agree Ronaldo has adopted a playing style where he is kind of useless when he s not scoring
Basically a slightly better version of Darren bent
Both are getting older their teams are changing and they have new colleagues to accommodate Messi moved further back and Ronaldo more forward It s how they work Messi wasn t always the finisher he became after a few years at Barcelona but he was always a playmaker He went back to his roots
Uh yea Messi was always a finisher ever since he was born
I think it s his work ethic when he s not performing up to his impossible standards It becomes piss poor
He s good at sooking
Or strangely because that s what the manager tells Ronaldo to do
I definitely agree with you Just saying they play different positions so you can t say why doesn t ronaldo drop deep then make an epic run
Because he can t He doesn t play that position because he can t It s not hating it s just a matter of fact
Messi was able to pick up the ball the fucking halfway line against bilbao in a cup final and beat players all the way and score a goal If ronaldo is as good as messi or better as some claim than he should be able to do the same The teammates have very little to do in goals such as these
They are both great players with different skillsets I do think messi is better than Ronaldo
I am never one for downplaying what Ronaldo has done at Madrid but even suggesting he is as good as Messi at this stage is ludicrous Those who go further and honestly believe he is a better footballer are insane
Messi was probably always better but there can t be any rational people who think Ronaldo is on Messi s level today
Cr absolutely deserved his ballon d ors
They don t understand football it s the only explanation Messi does things that are unimaginable until you ve seen him do it Ronaldo just does things very very well
Welp I guess that excludes any defender por goalkeeper from being one of the greats
I agree that messi is the best footballer but that doesn t mean that we define the best footballer by having messis skillset That s like saying Messi can t score a header while covered by 2 opposing players If he was as good as ronaldo he should be able to do that They are 2 different players with 2 different skillsets Just because Messi s looks better doesn t mean he is the better player
That s like saying if messi s as good as ronaldo let s see him score a rocket from 40 yards out
That s an incredibly stupid attitude to have So you can only be the best if you can dribble half the pitch and score It seems like you ve just found some way to disqualify everyone else for the sole purpose of saying that Messi is better The point is that you can t expect Ronaldo to beat the opposition all by himself in every big match like you re implying
It s not even like Messi is the only player who can do that sure he s the best but other players can dribble half the pitch and score
Maybe Messi is better than Ronaldo but just because Ronaldo doesn t play exactly the same way Messi does doesn t automatically disqualify him as equal It s hard to argue I know because most of the greats e g Maradona and Cruyff have been playmaking ball grabbing totalfootball goal monsters But it s up for debate if that is only way to be one of the true greats Ronaldo has done plenty of things Messi can t do
honestly one of the dumbest comments i ve ever read on here
Ask an Argentinian under Maradona Messi didn t manage to ever get the ball It s a team sport
Agreed He tends to get all the blame when in reality the whole team had been shit You can say that he gets most of the praise when the team wins and he scores He is the soul of Real Madrid in my opinion and its not wrong to criticize him when he performs below his sky high standards but fans of other club take it that we want him out I for one absolutely dont want him out and would like him to retire with Real Madrid That being said a LOT of Real Madrid who blabber every week that he should be sold for some other shiny toy are morons
That s why I don t get this post I remember those games that ronaldo was the only scorer in a 3 2 victory When ronaldo dragged us out of games we had no business winning He would have the worst game but manage to score twice His effort I d what made us champions in the time he has been here I m happy it s not just him now
I can understand when he plays for Portugal but when he plays for the richest team in the world there s no excuse None whatsoever
Right because the rest of the team was great in the big games and he was crap No the biggest culprits in the big game are the central mid Against Barca he had none of the ball he wasn t completely awful with the ball while the rest of the team were great Real Madrid fans are the least reliable source of information they ll turn on the team or a player in a second People conveniently forget last year he scored in both legs against Juve both league games against Barcelona scored against Atletico in the league assist against them in the CL Year before goal assist in CL final and huge number of goals in important games throughout the CL run Scored or assisted in both Barca league games also and scored against Atletico in the league 1 fucking year he has a relatively slow year and is still amazing just less amazing and Real fans think they should sell him because he can t score in big games it s genuinely pathetic
That s Real Madrid fans for you
get the ball dribble and score like Messi
You are correct As a madrid fan I have that very same view He keeps doing this unimportant goals against shit nonexistent teams but in el classico or any important match he is just one more spectator or he has a very bad attitude towards his teammates for scoring or when they do mistakes I think most of us want cristi out so our club can actually start winning TITLES again and not just win non important personal records for cristi

46 6 after his third goal today
Should it not be risen
Only Ronaldo could get criticised after scoring a hat trick
it s a pretty shocking stat tbf
Any player who scores 20 goals with 8 9 of them against two teams would probably have a post made about it It actually says something unlike a lot of the shitpost statistics on here
What was Suarez and his goals against Norwich Especially in the 13 14 season
I think the main difference is that Ronaldo has had a reputation for being absent in big games that Suarez never had This stat goes a big way to enforce that narrative
Early on he was criticized for not doing much in the Clasicos but then at one point he had scored in 6 or 7 matches in a row against Barca if I remember correctly
Suarez was extremely quiet in big games in the premier league Out of his two 30 odd goal seasons he scored like 3 goals against the top 4 finishers both seasons Out of his 54 goals in the premier league for them two seasons he scored 9 against Norwich 3 against Wigan 3 against West brom and 3 against Cardiff He s a phenomenal striker but it s a bad comparison
Quiet in terms of goals yes but he always played well in big games for us Off the top of my head I can remember his assist to Sterling that opened our scoring against City his almost wondergoal against Arsenal in the 5 1 and his dribble against you guys that Kuyt finished He definitely didn t disappear
Dirk Kuyt s hat trick vs MUFC which is among the shittiest hat trick ever in existance was the work of Su rez I think he assisted thrice or made all three goals by himself
iirc he always came from the left side into the box beating multiple defenders while doing so and passing the ball for a tap in He did that twice and for the third time he was brought down which resulted in a penalty and a hatric for Kuyt
There s 9 out of 54 and then there s 9 out of 20
I still wish that almost wonder goal shouldve went in He deserved a stunner like that that day
the post got absolutely demolished with that strike
that was exactly the criticism weighing down suarez in 2013 14 he scored some 20 of his 31 goals against bottom half clubs and failed to score once against the top 4
Is it that shocking He played them both two times and in total he played 26 games this season so in 15 of his games he scored 44 of the goals Plus you know how the whole team of Real Madrid underperforms against Atletico Barcelona Espanyol kept Barca at 0 0 and Malmo plays in the CL yet he bangs in a lot of goals against them Nothing to get too fixated about imo
he s scored nearly half his goals in 4 games against 2 teams thats crazy
espanyol plays their hearts out against barca and let madrid walk on them tho
I think you usually play your hearts out when you re facing your city rivals Besides we have the same record as Barcelona does vs Espanyol during the last 10 liga games But hey if it suits your narrative
Ronaldo scores a goal
context
Because Madrid is on the 3rd spot this season
Eibar has been great this season to be fair
you mean TSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Only people from 4chan sp say that
Not surprised one bit He doesnt need to score in the next few big games now after todays hat trick
Honestly my flair aside I think this is the perfect time to sell ronaldo Not at his peak anymore but still scores enough goals to be an important player
the difficult part is to find a replacement with both football and business value at that level
I thought the main reason we bought Bale was to replace Ronaldo with him
Bale seems to be that player for years to come but I always got the feeling RM were eyeing Hazard to be that player as well Although I personally think Bale is a better player than Hazard even when both are on their good days With Hazard playing as he is maybe that is not the case anymore
Honestly RM will always want the player of the year of the EPL I don t see Hazard to be any better than Isco or James I actually think James is above Hazard let alone Bale
lol imagine if they tried to sign Vardy
Hazard s still young he could go to Real and step up his game considerably
What s people s idea of young Hazard is 25 already and he is only one and a half years younger than Bale
25 isn t very old really I d say 25 is the make or break part of your career Its when you re young enough to have a window of potential but too old for that dumb he s young give him a break argument Hazard and Oscar for that matter can still get better and better Willian looked like he had a lot of potential when he was their age and now he s at peak form Now if you were to tell me someone like Andre Schurrle is still young and may grow to be a huge part of the German NT again I d cringe internally And notice he s the same age as Hazard Truth is Hazard is young enough for Madrid to keep an eye on him But he s old enough for people to really start weighing him up against senior players like Ronaldo Ribery Robben and Messi as opposed to weighing him up against the likes of Gotze Sterling Sharaawy Pogba and co not to say he s at Messi s or Ronaldo s level just that he s technically in their age group now Basically if at 25 you still need time to develop and show your worth you re probably a lost cause But if you re truly talented and people know you re worth like Hazard then its totally fair to spend big to bring you over to develop
TL DR He is neither young nor old Which is kind of what I was implying
It s not so much age as development Players like Bale and Ronaldo have moved to the next level after they ve moved to Real and both moved at around that age so I could see Hazard doing the same
In my opinion James will be the one to replace Ronaldo Bales definitely got the ability and skill but I feel like James has the potential to surpass bale
I d rather Reus at Real and Hazard at Bayern It s just feels right
Is that likely though On the pitch maaaybe Off the pitch Bale doesn t have the PR machine or the ego I don t mean that negatively Ronaldo s ego is part of what makes him a global superstar He s also not as pretty Bale just isn t going to sell as many shirts or attract as many fans
Maybe because RM doesn t push Bale as best of the world as much as they do with Ronaldo If he were to spend the same amount of attention on Bale I m sure they could do just as good enough job They also have James as the pretty boy face to offset whatever Bale can t sell
From an outsiders perspective Ronaldo is just the brand of the modern Real Madrid I see a dozen little Ronaldo s everyday in their shirts the same with the little Messis and Neymars Even now I rarely see a Bale
Why does he have to be a carbon copy of Ronaldo I ve never understood this The new player can contribute in other ways it s not like Benzema Bale Isco James Modric Kroos don t know how to score And not even mentioning two of the best offensive defenders Ramos and Marcello Ligas aren t won by winning 8 0 instead of 2 0 Once Messi retires Barca shouldn t try to find a replacement for a player who is arguably the best playmaker in the game has insane statistics with his passes while scoring 50 goals a year It s not reasonable Ronaldo and Messi were above and beyond other players you can replace them without trying to copy them Bayern are doing well without a Messi or Ronaldo
not carbon copy one cannot even replace gerrard or xavi let alone cristiano or messi that s just the direction to think about and it is hard even to think of a player who might have that level of potential
I would argue barca has already found a replacement for messi if they can sort out his ridic wage demands
Quality and business wise We will never be able to replace Ronaldo Anyone else will be a step down from Ronaldo and people should realize this before spending tons of money on some other player
at least need someone with that level of potential maybe hazard or reus
Reus would be the perfect signing imo Probably the best winger in the world that is not playing for Bayern or Barca Much better than the likes of Hazard offensively and I think he could really contribute
pls no
He could really shine in a role that feeds the ball to him or lets him get touches but he can do that just as well in Dortmund I honestly don t think if he were to transfer Real would be good for him I know it s unrealistic to think he ll never leave Dortmund but if he does I do hope he can go to a team that will get the most out of his incredible skillset
personally i think hazard is a much better option real madrid needs a player with good dribbling skill especially close control in tight space to break strong opponents down since di maria s departure
Seems like he would be much more expensive and not per se better
That s exactly what they don t need at the moment They need someone to replace in some way all the goals Ronaldo scores Hazard won t do that Reus might
except football doesn t work like that Whoever you use to replace cristiano except messi Bale and Benzema are more likely than him to score those missing goals You can plug in the formula with Lewan Reus Neymar or even Suarez and still this is the natural conclusion
Hazard Not that he is a good replacement but he s who they ve talked about and when he s good he s very good He s no Rolando but he ll suffice I don t think you can find a true replacement for their best player in years
Real is going to miss Cristiano real bad once he s gone They will know when Barca and Atletico beat them every time for maybe 2 years
Not if they replace him well they ve got the money
Where do lucas vazquez and Jese play Or maybe they re not good enough
Suarez and Ronaldo compared
Who decided to write Athletic and then Athletic Bilbao Had me confused for a second
Probably due to the character limit in tweets
Should be Athletic both times
Sevilla La Liga winners confirmed
He doesn t get to play Real Madrid s defence what a shame
Madrid in general have been terrible against strong teams
Under Benitez
We d be happy to take him back if you don t want him
It s like people forget all the times Ronaldo did score against big opposition
so people can t criticize him till he reitres coz he once scored in big matches
No I m just saying it doesn t change his stature as a player He turns 31 this Friday do you expect him to forever be in his prime
I think that is exactly what the whole point is He is not in his prime anymore However his supporters defend any criticism by pointing towards the number of goals he has scored this season which is still ridiculous for someone not in his prime tbh But from this piece of statistics it is clear that he is not scoring against big teams and in matches that matter like he used to when he was in his prime
It s forever been an argument though Ronaldo doesn t score in big games Just like how morons say Messi can t do it without Xavi and Iniesta
I don t agree with the fact that Ronaldo has never scored in big games He has But I do strongly agree that his goal statistics this season are not a reflection of how he has been playing Just looking at his statistics it would seem like he is still the second best player in the world But imo he isn t anymore
I agree But I still think it s normal for a player to regress over time I mean he s not old but he s 31 and I would definitely say in terms of overall contribution he s still a player in the top 5 bracket
Bah he got lucky okay
Malm s season having ended over a month before that last game didn t help either
At least we have the fans
Indeed
Is this the annual meeting for MFF fans on r soccer
Of course we are a few after all
no wonder he wants to leave RM after all he s done he still has to put up with this
When did he say he wanted to leave If i remembered correctly he has said he wants to retire at Real
How have you made it sound like a bad thing that a player has the highest demands highest wages and highest expectations gets criticised for not performing well when it matters most HOW
itd be nice if he turned up in a big game for once this season or the last
itd be nice if Real as a whole turn up in big games this season
That would not be nice
This exactly People gotta stop blaming him its fucking stupid
Yeah like that match against Schalke last season where he totally didn t keep Madrid in the CL by carrying the team on his back
Or against you guys when he scored 2 big goals
Nah pretty sure his almost 60 goals last season were all against relegation teams and the matches were won anyways
I think he s entitled to have one bad season after years of breaking records and winning ballon d ors
People are so ungrateful The consistent excellence of Ronaldo and Messi has spoilt everyone The moment Ronaldo starts to show signs of being human people jump on his back And he just scored a hattrick We re all going to look back on the last few years as an anomaly Will we ever experience such binary luminescence as Messi and Ronaldo
I ve never seen a much player get shit on so much for scoring a hattrick For fucks sake I get not liking your rival team or their players but this is ridiculous
This shit is as barbaric as the dumbasses that shit on Lebron after a triple double
Wait is 14 goals in four games a bad thing
It s absolutely incredible but I think the talking point here is that he has scored basically the same amount of goals in all his other games which include tougher opponents
That s still 16 goals in his other 24 games which seems alright to me It s high right now but by the end of the season the percentage will be significantly lower It s not really news that a player scores more goals against rubbish teams than good teams is it
It isn t news normally but it does become more relevant when we are talking about a player who has been one of the best in the world for almost the last 10 years 0 goals against Atletico Barca PSG Villareal Sevilla etc isn t a coincidence when we re talking about a player of Ronaldo s caliber
At least in the league the problem is that he s only scored 2 in 9 apps against La Liga s top half teams Given his contribution to the team is predominantly goals that is a huge problem because the team suffers a lot from it
Yeah but against the Top 6 La Liga opponents he has scored 0 Combined And 0 against PSG The point is not just that he scored most of his goals against two teams but also that the rest of the goals were against low tier teams as well none against actual top opposition So while his goal tally is impressive regardless of opposition he still is practically useless at actually making an impact If you would have removed him completely he would still have barely any impact on the table at least compared to most other top offensive players
Except he has a bunch of assists too
No it s a good thing A bad thing is no goals against during strong teams
Just because the Messi Ronaldo debate is raging in this thread I thought I would add my own views I ve never been a fan of Ronaldo and have always preferred Messi s attitude and general demeanor so perhaps that adds a certain amount of bias to my opinion But I must admit Ronaldo has been and is a fantastic player He s worked bloody hard for it too And this is the difference for me Ronaldo is more of a supreme athlete and credit where credit is due he has used this to his advantage Messi on the other hand is the total footballer the more natural footballer That s not to say he hasn t worked hard at all but I just think watching Messi is like watching magic play out whereas watching Ronaldo is like watching a well oiled factory destroying its opposition because of its sheer size and efficiency Perhaps that s not a great analogy But that s how I see it I also see Messi as being the better team player as well and that makes a huge difference The best footballer isn t the one who selfishly goes about his career doing things for himself Bringing other players into a game or heightening their ability is just as impressive if not more so
He must be shit
It seems like you ve just found some way all the blame when in reality the whole team had been shit
ITT Ronaldo is literal shit if I were in charge I d tie him to a a bunch of rocks and throw him down a stream
It s hilarious reading some of the garbage on here Worst thing is a lot of them speak with this arrogance as if they actually know anything about football
How many fucking times will this be posted
wow
Maybe he read that Reddit where someone posted about if he doesn t score until X year he can still get a better goal ratio than Ra l or something like that
I completely disagree with all the idea of selling Ronaldo and all the current hate Even if you disregard what he has done for the club people are overreacting Even when he plays poorly he is still drawing defenders and even creating chances without touching the ball James golden chance against betis volley off a corner was created by Ronaldo s run and early jump at the ball It s a bit past halfway in the season and too early to take the stat If you look at Suarez season st Liverpool I m sure after the Norwich games Norwich was a big chunk of his goals but look at the same percentage at the end of the season And he s the best penalty taker in the world which is pretty valuable
No doubt he s not having his best season Still miles ahead of most players though Nobody else has scored that many goals against either team in recent times let alone in one season
Stop trying to be so nice Aduriz has scored 5 goals vs Barcelona this season Let alone a few against Villareal Eibar Of which Ronaldo has scored 0 Most top strikers in La Liga have scored at least one goal vs the top 6 teams Ronaldo has scored 0 It is an insanely bad statistic Not Ronaldo bad but any striker bad For the best player in one of the best teams in the world it s not just bad it s absolutely atrocious Messi for instance was injured for like two months He still scored Sevilla 2 Bilbao 2 Atl Madrid 2 Roma 2 Equivalent of PSG for Real Even though he missed a lot he still managed to score 8 goals against top tier teams that Real scored 0 against Yes Roma PSG but it s the closest comparison There is no excuse for not scoring a single goal against the top 6 teams in your league as the best player in Real Madrid and only 2 against the entire top half Especially when you dominate the penalty records as in being the player who takes the most penalties in all top leagues in all seasons Along with being the player who takes the most shots by FAR of ANY offensive player There is no excuse don t be so nice
Literally one less than godlike season and suddenly everyone should call him trash Look at the last 10 years of his career He earned one season where he didn t score against bigger teams Shit he still scored more than most other players even in his depleted state Gtfo
Well Espanyol is Ronaldo s biggest fan
It s a well known fact that Espanyol tend to roll over v Madrid as they are Barca s greatest rival but imagine if Rayo or Atletico did the same v Barca Nuns would get UEFALONA tramp stamps
facts since 1994 barcelona has scored 96 against espanyol and conceded 37 real has scored 104 and conceded 35

Chill out Newcastle
Newcastle right now
I saw that double post u cheeky cunt
You mean double answer to this comment xD I was editing but pressed enter before finishing lol
One of my favourite memes P
It s a better than a few years ago when Keegan told Mike Ashley exactly how much to bid in order to guarantee getting some players and he offered way under those offers just to say We bidded for him they rejected it
Has anyone told Newcastle that starting 11 strikers isn t a viable tactic
It worked in the 1920s dammit
Still want us to sign a striker that can finish the chances he gets Mitrovic Perez are sorely lacking in that and Cisse is injured
We ve got Gini we just need people who can get the ball to him for a few years while we prime Perez And we need to back Cisse off to China asap
We don t have the time to wait for Perez or Mitrovic to start scoring goals we are in the shit right now and banking on a midfielder to score the goals we need is a crazy idea
He s an advanced midfielder all good advanced midfielders score goals The keys getting him to play further up the pitch than he has been and getting better playmaking from the other guys At the minute it feels like we want him and Rob Elliot to single handedly defeat every opponent and it s not working
It s like Mike Ashleys spent a bit of money and got the biggest fucking throbbing erection from it so now he s doing it again and again Didn t know what this felt like now he s gone mad He s had a taste of power and now he wants the lot
Bringing the money to the table in big Sports Direct bags
All 15m in one fuck off mug
He s delivering it in free coats
The original source is France Football for anyone who was wondering Newcastle are going in this transfer window No fucking around
Going to be real disappointing when it doesn t fix anything
http imgur com 6ADLV4r
pls don t take him pls
Offer rejected
I know but they could make a bigger offer
Islam Slimani is worth much more than 15M
Much more 15M seems a fair price for a 28 year old player with 18 good months in the Portuguese league
Here we go the portuguese league circlejerk
The league that makes Moussa Maazou and Ricky van Wolfswinkel look good
Ricky was always shite
Well he had a ratio of one goal every two games with Sporting
You mean the same league can that can make shitty players like Ronaldo Nani Falco Diego Costa James David Luiz Hulk Joao Moutinho look good
How is that relevant Did I say the Portuguese league had never produced good players
Just as irrelevant as your snide comment about the quality of the league
Have you watched him He s very good
I have thats why I say he is worth more than 15
Him and Jonas have been incredible this season
Jonas has been amazing this and last season Slimani has been good but he plays too much with his elbows
The man has got a wicked name I ll tell ya
Next Newcastle bid 50 M for Nicklas Bendtner
Slimani is a lot better than Bendtner mate
That s beside the point The point is Newcastle are more desperate than a virgin at a strip club
Im guessing you are speaking from experience
Ooooh top banter
Funnier than beating the dead Bendtner joke horse

The free kick that sealed the deal on Saturday https streamable com 2xku
he looks very overweight
That s because he is
I think it s just the wind blowing his shirt around
I have the same problem
I m so underwhelmed by this potential transfer
two years ago I d have been well up for it now I thought he had retired to be honest
Nearly as bad as Aspas s corner
I really don t know what Enrique Klopp were thinking with this Guy hasn t even touched the ball yet and he takes a long free kick
Klopp probably expected a professional footballer to be able to lift a ball up
He was probably thinking that Enrique is a professional footballer earning 60 000 a week he s kicked a ball before On that money it shouldn t be beyond his ability to kick the ball into the box He obviously put too much faith in Enrique Enrique pressed Circle on the controller when he should have pressed Square
He could have just lumped it high and looping into the box If the keeper catches it no problem Instead he tries to curl in a sexy dipping freekick and almost costs his team a goal
He followed that up by losing Antonio and gifting him a free header at the back post
tbf Antonio fouled him
He looks fat
Hahah oh my god He looks so uncomfortable taking it
This is hilarious but scary Kristenbelllaughingthencrying gif
What an incredible story Professional gamer turned footballer
Pretty sure Stuart Holden did the same thing
Say what you will about Jose Enrique but not many players go out of their way to play games and interact with fans
Because most players actually have training to do
ah most of them finish training at about 2
Oh man he hasn t played in ages and most certainly has gone downhill but I really did like him when he played for us Could be an alright temporary solution if his wages aren t horrendous I do remember him trashing on us after he left though so wonder if that s brought up again
Please take him He wouldn t be good enough for Newcastle s u21s at this point but please just take him
He s on quite a bit of money too isn t he
Yes he is For playing table tennis all day
Aw get fucked
I know we need a left back I m just not sure a player that s made 12 league appearances in the last 3 years is going to be worthwhile He was good when he played for us though
He used to be good Now he is a joke of a player and is arguably championship level
Is Dummett that shit
He can fuck off I remember what he said when he left Newcastle simpering about joining a big club and commenting on how we would never finish in the top six with our current policy He gets booed every time he comes back to SJP No idea what the club is thinking if they re negotiating this we might as well resign Dietmar Hamann or Michael Owen while we re signing money chasing pariahs
He wasn t wrong though was he
He was he left us in August 2011 and we finished 6th 5th that season Do you not remember that match when Reina was sent off and he Enrique ended up in goal in front of the Newcastle fans screaming we re in the top five we re in the top five Jose Enrique we re in the top five
We finished 5th that season didn t we
And here you are Relegation battlers
Yeah I m absolutely certain that if Enrique had stayed we would have kept up the top of the table mate Us little club fans don t know what we re missing do we
Funny thing is until the Suarez season Liverpool hadn t finished higher than 6th since 2008 09
he wasn t when it comes to MA s policy although apparently that is changing but we did give the top 4 5 a good run the year he left
Let s just sign everyone s unwanted shit
This window isn t all that bad
Not sure if Enrique is better than Dummett these days
I ve done all I can on Mario Kart I need to move on to a new challenge
nufc is going to be tagged a lot on instagram
Enrique is such a waste of a footballing contract wouldn t even have him playing in my local Sunday league side

The Ronaldo Messi wankfest is starting early today Why are some in red
I m guessing the red ones indicate the good teams
Celta vigo are good enough to be considered a good team
lol getting downvotes because Celta happen to be high in the table this season Nevermind the fact that they have been bouncing between the first and second division for eternity
Yeah kind of like that shit club Leicester City am I right No teams are judged by the quality of football they deliver today not how they have looked over the last decade
except when the stats are from the last decade and not this year you wazzock
What s a Wazzock Is it derived from Wazza I like it
Just means an idiot really Craig Charles used to always say it on Takeshis Castle
Totally forgot about that show Absolutely loved it Like my father used to say
Top 6 from La Liga I believe
Maybe multiple competitions White is only league
Teams in red indicate goals only scored through penalties
So you are saying he s scored 21 penalties vs Sevilla are you sure
Yeah absolutely
he has scored 5 hat tricks against Sevilla
That s a lot of penalties
I think you re funny
Started off slow but now you re on fire
jaja so funny mate BANTZ

That s why everybody is talking about how he can t score against big teams now because he used to do it
i think the point most people are making is that if he had neymar suarez and Iniesta supporting him instead of bale benz and isco he still probably would be racking up the goals and assists in the big games I can t imagine if you replaced Ronaldo with Messi barca would stop being as dominant And I can t imagine if you replaced Ronaldo with Messi in that 4 0 barca would lose it s a team sport and barca has a much better team
Wow he ONLY has Benzema Bale James Modric Isco Carvajal and marcelo to support him It must be really hard
Your argument is like getting angry at Everton for failing to win the PL because they have great players like Lukaku Baines and Mirallas Neymar and Suarez are the 3rd and 4th best players in the world Bale and Benz are very good players but nowhere close Iniesta Rakitic and Busquets are significantly better than Modric Kroos and Casemiro Better support players makes scoring and assisting easier He s still outscoring Messi and assisting more than him It s not like Ronaldo s struggling In half a season of his supposedly worst form he s matched the best world class seasons of Henry Totti RvN etc In big games his team doesn t play well That s not up for debate Barca is a better team that s been better managed
Iniesta and Rakitic are significantly better than Modric and Kroos Modric is arguably the best midfielder in the world and Rakitic isn t in the same level as Kroos Kroos and Modric play in a 2 man midfield and neither of them is a CDM while Iniesta and Rakitic have the best DM in the world behind them It s not Kroos s fault he isn t utilized properly and yet he s been very good these past two months As for Messi it would make a huge difference if Ronaldo were to replace him Messi is the GOAT and he can win games even when his team are having an awful game he can create goals by himself Ronaldo on the otherside has been nothing but a poacher in the past 2 seasons Real and Barca both have great squads but Messi is the difference maker
Iniesta is much better than Modric and Rakitic is much better than Kroos Barca would still destroy Madrid if you switched Messi and Ronaldo Suarez and Neymar are so much better than anyone else on Madrid
Just by checking his recent post history I got a headache He seriously thinks Barca would ve won everything last year even if Messi didn t play for them One of the stupidest things I ve read in a while
Off the top of my head I dont think they would have gotten past Bayern as easily without Messi going full Messi
In what fucking alternate dimension do you exist where Modric is a better footballer than Iniesta Am I on drugs and don t remember taking them
I said nothing about Modric being a better footballer this season at least but considering Modric was better for both the entire 13 14 season and the first half of last season I don t think you can make the statement Iniesta is much better than Iniesta They re clearly very close in terms of ability even if they do play different roles in their teams
He has been better the past 3 seasons Modric is our most important player everything revolves around him He was one of the main reasons of our success in the 13 14 and that was obvious when he was injured in the 14 15 when Real went from the best team in the world to the 3rd best in Spain and failed to win any trophy And this season despite being coached by Rafa he still managed to do very good when the team was in a very poor state Maybe you don t rate him but I watch him every game and he is a difference maker for us
Please tell me that s not sarcasm
Much better is the part I m questioning Less than two years ago Modric was better and there was no question about it but since then Barcelona as a whole has significantly improved and Iniesta has been better There s no doubt that Iniesta at his peak is far better than Modric but to be able to suggest that Iniesta right now is much better than Modric shows clear bias towards Iniesta
I m not sure I agree Modric has periods of being world class and is always a top player Iniesta has periods of being only a top player but is normally world class At modrics best probably the middle of the unbeaten run you would still never put him under messi Ronaldo as the no 3 let alone really in the same breath as those two but iniesta has been hanging around there most of his career For me iniesta has a decent margin over modric career wise On his best day modric sure puts up a fight though
And clearly you know fuck all about football
Lol at lukaku baines mirallas being called GREAT Messi have been injured for 2 months
That s the point Barca has an insane squad they don t even need Messi
That s not what he said
That s exactly what I said Learn to read
If that s what you said then it s crap they do need Messi indeed He has scored important goals and he s always there when it matters when the others couldn t capitalise
Barca would still win everything without him He makes the team so much better but they re a team full of world class players
You heavily underestimate how damn important Messi actually is for Barca He s not only a playmaker for them higher up on the pitch but the Argentine has took over the role Xavi had previously Cristiano on the other hand can t make an impact if he doesn t apepar on Livescore
I don t know how Messi s scoring record is relevant to this post or the comment you replied to The narrative here is he is not scoring goals in big games as much as he used to and he seems to be in a decline And I personally didn t see anyone else apart from you who have used your logic in recent days Correct me if I am wrong about it And it s not like there was any change to the players that feed him the ball from last season He used to score in the big matches with almost the same set of players last season too Ok maybe Rafa s tactics had something to do with it but he also hasn t yet set the league alight after Zidane took charge Maybe it s still early days into Zizou s tenure and yeah let s wait a while before claiming that his days as one of the top 5 footballers are clearly numbered
They played their best football those 2 months Messi was injured Barca has atleast 10 world class players if not more swap Messi for Ronaldo and they d still romp to the treble with Ronaldo top scorer and assister You re just the resident contrarian who shits on anything tangentially related to United England You ve been called out on your hypocrisy so many time in r reddevils it s hard to take you seriously anymore
i think barca is better atm but if we take the exact same teams and switch the two they ll be equal cuz ronaldo neymar suarez will be great and messi would be able to lift Bale and benzema up with his assists
out of all the madrid s midfielders why did you pick isco james or modric is not a huge drop off from what iniesta provides
They have a very comparable team if you take Messi out of the equation I don t think Barca will be as dominant without Messi He is the x factor He is the person Barca turn to in big matches and he mostly delivers Look at the big matches last season CL semifinal and final Copa final Liga decider against Atletico He delivered in crunch times for the team
Everyone s talking about this season Suarez and Neymar especially have been the ones delivering those big moments If we re looking at entire careers or just a couple of years Ronaldo s consistently a big game player too Though you can t say Neymar and Suarez are top 3 players in the world on one hand and then say Barca s not so good If anything they were playing their best football those 2 months Messi was injured
Messi didn t dominate this weekend Messi Suarez and Neymar all dominated together
Neymar didn t play that well lol Messi and Suarez dominated
Neymar was shut down and Suarez did nothing bar the goal 2 shots 1 on target 0 dribbles 0 chances created 4 times dispossesed Messi decided the match as he has done many other times
Lol Messi was doing hell of a lot more than Neymar and Suarex last weekend don t know if you ve even watched the game
Messi had a great performance during that match I watched it myself and was better than Neymar or Su rez though they were great as well It s hard to quantify these things but as a matter of support for my point Messi did get the Man of the Match from WhoScored com and Mundo Deportivo readers poll also put Messi as the most decisive player in the match by quite a margin If you want further evidence just check the Post Match Thread on r Barca where the discussion normally doesn t include that much about Messi just to keep things broad Messi also came off the bench to score in the winner against At tico at Calder n at the beginning of the season the rest of the team couldn t break the deadlock I don t want to come off as putting down Neymar and Su rez who are amazing players and so is Ronaldo It s just to object to the point that Messi no longer makes a difference for Barcelona and he very much does
I d like to agree you point that Bale is not far from being good in the same term as any of MSN trio although the Welsh is a fantastic player But you re wrong when it s about Karim Benzema In fact he s the best striker in the world alongside with Su rez and is responsable for a lot of Cristiano s goals at Real Madrid Something that even Carlo Ancelotti himself said once And I don t really see why you pick Isco who s the next big thing in Spain and leave out Modric And I could talk mention other world class player Madrid possess Real Madrid is one of the absolute best teams in the world maybe among top 4 so I don t really believe it s because of Cristiano has some poor team mates that you d like to describe Benzema and Bale having a great season statistically speaking and shows up against when it matter so I don t really think the problem lies on them but rather on Cristiano himself And forgive me if I sound harsh but you re an idiot if you think Barcelona wouldn t stop being dominant as they re now if Cristiano which we all know it s not gonna happened anyway replaced Messi I don t really know if you watch Madrid Barca games but it s more than obvious that Messi just more than scoring goals like the Portuguese only does The Argentine is the biggest reason why Barca are the best team in the world
Wouldn t goals per match be more interesting
This is useless as fuck with no real explanations Is it only in the league or does it also count goals from other competitions What s the red teams and what s the white teams
The bigger criticism should be that this shows his entire career stat in the league I m guessing however no one is saying Ronaldo s never scored against big teams
You got it all wrong OP the circlejerk of the month is that Ronaldo can only score against weaker teams or when it doesn t matter This post does not fit the circlejerk at all
Everyone is talking about the current season not his entire career and it s absolutely true It s a circlejerk for you because you re a Ronaldo fanboy otherwise it s a fact backed up by multiple statistics
Actually not long ago there was an article posted that claims Ronaldo had only earned his team 3 points this season and a lot of people here agrees with it because only the first goal in a 6 0 game matters lel Some even started saying that he had been doing this for a long time and therefore his goalscoring stats had always been massively inflated But of course I am a Ronaldo fanboy and thus I must be wrong
I don t care what a bunch of idiots who started watching football after the world cup think This season Ronaldo was invisible and failed to score against the top teams That s what most people argue With facts and statistics backing it up For other seasons the statistics are out there it doesn t matter what some say
Its only january lol the proper big games like the ucl ties and the league deciders are yet to come Some people are just using games where rm has dropped points as big games when past season or the season before they were easy fixtures
LMAO proper big games you guys are hilarious Atletico Madrid Barca PSG are big teams that made Ronaldo invisible on the field
He could still score against barca in the clasico against atletico and in multiple CL games The season is far from over Statistics taken halfway thru the season cannot reflect the entire season If the season ends and all this holds true then come back and tell us Ronaldo is shit edit the man has played 2 games against Espanyol and Malmo only 1 game against atleti Barca sevilla valencia malaga celta bilbao and Villareal
He has been shit against top teams since the beginning of the season that s what matters That s the discussing point who said anything about entire seasons Stop making up excuses for him
Well you just refer to the season and you re comparing it to other FULL seasons which is invalid because this is half a season I am not making excuses I am just pointing out that this season isnt over edit season isnt over as in he s played the two 50 of goal teams twice while only 1 game against atleti Barca sevilla valencia malaga celta bilbao and Villareal
First of all i m talking about the current season and i ve specified that in every single comment If you fucking took the time to read more than one word from my comment you would easily figure that out Second no one is comparing anything to other full seasons you just made that up I ll say it again performances since the beginning of the season until NOW that s the discussing point 0 goals against top teams Since the start of the season until now 50 of the goals scored against 2 shit teams Since the start of the season until now You get the idea
Just because he didn t score doesn t mean he was invisible He hardly did anything wrong against Barcelona and was really unlucky not to get a goal Bravo was having a night of his life He was also pretty decent against PSG and created some chances down the wing again I doubt you even watched those games it s all about the circlejerk bandwagon eh
Yh but they made the whole team dissapear Only ones to score in those 4 games are nacho and benzema So its not like they were easy wins against big teams but more the whole team and ronaldo playing shit
But those are the moments and matches that defines a great player That is the moment when a great player drags his team across the finishing line Messi against Bayern for example He took the game by the scruff of the neck and made his mark when it mattered the most
Yes and then he failed to do it against athletic and celta at the start of the season
But Messi delivered against Sevilla Atl tico 2x Bilbao and Roma Cristiano on the other hand was dog shit against top 6 teams in La Liga PSG
Exactly Ronaldo can t make the difference when it matters
THIS is what I have to remind people EVERY FUCKING YEAR the season is not over yet He can have on hell of a come back Christ this is getting fucking ridiculous
Cant fucking wait for it Next stop roma then atleti
So what about the games against Villarreal Sevilla Valencia Barcelona Atl tico and PSG were Cristiano failed to deliver Also he s never scored when Real Madrid was down with a goal
Forgot the 4 0
so Cristiano actually scored in big games as well But is it because the good opponents have more games against Real Madrid I want a piece of per game statistics to understand better
No he bangs in 5 per game against Barcelona Atletico Just like Messi always bangs in 5 per game against Real It s not that hard to understand Point is that fanboys on this sub always try to give stats that suit their narrative There s no real fact here He always had important goals but Real isn t rolling like it should against the bigger teams this season and fanboys like to use that to go nuts
5 per game against Barca Atletico That can t be right
Where have you ever seen someone say Ronaldo never scored against big teams The whole narrative is he s shite this season cuz he only bangs em in against lower placed teams
Messi fanboys have been saying it for the past half decade
Ronaldo has performed in big games for a long time now but recent criticism of him stemmed from the fact that very recently he might not have been up to the same standard in big games and only looks as good now as he has done for the last 7 or 8 years because he s putting in so many vs weaker teams Disclaimer I have no idea how many goals Ronaldo has scored this season vs good teams or actually any idea how many goals he s scored period because somehow I ve managed not to get too involved in the debate My gut tells me that generally harsh criticism of a player who 12 months ago was regarded as joint best in the world is probably knee jerk but it is a little disingenuous to frame recent criticism of Ronaldo as invalid because historically he s performed well against strong teams
Very lawyer esque
The recent criticism is invalid because a lot of people hate Ronaldo and are just waiting to pounce on a patch of bad form read not scoring at least one goal a game every game to crisitcise
I d like to see goals per game by opponent Real plays Barca Athletico more often than other teams
If you are looking for explanation of the white and red teams a friend sent me this yesterday yes he s a Barca fan CR this season
He plays some of those teams a lot more then others
Watch out lads got a fucking genius in our midst here
thanks dude haha
Nice stat Just keep in mind that stronger teams play other stronger teams more often so there are more games in there
Love how people claim he has rarely turned up in big games against big teams
People claim more about recent events not whole career Because this season he hasn t really scored against big teams Noone doubts that he has been great against big teams in his career only idiot would deny that
He quite clearly isn t considering almost half his goals THIS season have been against 2 poor teams No one is claiming he has never turned up against good teams
What games have real had this season that you re counting as big
2 games against PSG 1 against Barcelona Atletico Madrid Athletic Villareal Celta Vigo and Sevilla Against the top 6 in la liga and the only other challenger in Real Madrid s CL group Ronaldo has totaled 1 goal and 1 assist
T H I S S E A S O N
they said it last season too tbf
BUT THIS IS TRUE WHY IS IT DOWNVOTED HOLY FUCK THIS SUB IS SHIT AHSAJKBXDKLJDSHBJOKFVC DHOUVGJH PL KRETGV
Salty madrid fans and Ronaldo fanboys
The counterjerk is strong with this one
Is there a Manchester united Cristiano infograph
I wonder what non la liga teams would be like I think Galatasaray is up there too
Would like to see the Premier League version of this He enjoyed giving us a good slapping in his Premier League days
I really like that people upped this inspite of it having no indications of when this was made out of how many total goals what seasons ect
funny that 11 of his 15 goals against espanyol have come in the last 3 meetings hat trick in mid may last season 5 goals in september and another hat trick over the weekend
Holy shit guys can we talk about football Leave the r circlejerk in Goal com comment section or your proper fan subs
Fuck this doesn t push r soccer s narrative of Ronaldo not scoring against good teams edit a word
This season
Well if you re so sure why not link those responses then
Here s one of the many Actually just go on the thread and search by controversial to find them all
Wow who are messi favorite teams to score against What does messi like for dinner or pre match meal What is his shoe size Is he better than Patrick bamford Does he plan to play under klopp
lol
The mighty behemoths Osasuna Getafe and Zaragoza
What about Atletico Real and Sevilla
Do you jerk off to that chart

He would have been better off starting at Fulham
If it goes wrong at Fulham maybe his management career is over If it continues to go badly at Valencia I reckon he could still come back to England and get a championship team If it goes well at Valencia then he will be a champions league level manager straight away
In the same vein I can only see Giggs starts his managerial career at ManUTD Mate I can t wait for this to happen
It s all hearsay but if reports are to be believed Woodward is doing everything possible to avoid having Giggs as a manager after LVG
offer a job to Chris Coleman and dump Giggs to manage the wales NT
Why would Giggs manage Wales
So Welsh people can meet him
Feral
More like why would the Welsh waste their golden generation on a traitorous twat
He does have some brains after all then
If he s as good at politicing with managers as he is at signing players there s nothing to worry about
I genuinely don t know why would Woodward not want Giggs to be the next manager
Source is the journalist that first reported LVG as being MUTD s next manager He s gotten some predictions wrong but I feel like he s rather reliable Forgot his name easy to google if you care to Apparently Giggs and the rest of the class of 92 have a different vision for the future of MUFC than Woodward and the Glazers It s a touchy situation because making Giggs a manager will give the class of 92 more power within the club which he is trying to avoid It s just a rumour but in my eyes it s fairly plausible It s not a crazy rumour such as Messi Ronaldo to United
What s the difference in vision Do you mind elaborating if you know more
Oh gotcha Thanks for the explanation
Possibly realises what a disaster itd be
Giggs as manager with Queiroz and Mourinho as Assistent Managers
Valencia s shite season is hardly his fault and he s only an interim manager anyway so people will likely be willing to look more kindly on his lack of success there as an important learning experience He can come back from this and still look like a pretty desirable manager for a side like Swansea or something
Luis Enrique was terrible at Roma So there s still a chance for him
But he did pretty good at Barca B before so Celta Vigo could took that to their account when they hired him after Roma which then he deliver
Not as terrible as Neville though He actually won some games
Lucho took over a squad that finished 6th previous season and finished 7th The year after Roma finished 6th again Neville took over a squad which had qualified for the CL last year and was four points off the CL places They re now in 15th and haven t won a league game under him Point is Lucho may have been disappointing but Neville has been terrible and it s not even close
Not to be too harsh to a legend of my club but yes a smaller job would ve been better as things stand I want him to defy expectations of course but it s all too big too quick
no should be in the lower one like Salford City
PeterLim ValenciaNevilleOut ValenciaCarragherIn
Never should ve been his first managerial job Idk why he d do that
No the question is who in his right mind would OFFER the job to a NON SPANISH SPEAKING PUNDIT This is a no brainer for me anyone who has a fully functioning brain in his fucking head wouldn t do this I don t know what Lim thought while offering Neville the job This is fucking ridiculous like how stupid can you be Especially when fucking Bielsa was available who is excellent for the short term
You re right I don t understand why a club of Valencia s size would take such an unlikely gamble like this His punditry is good and he was a really good player but that doesn t equate to managerial worth I could see why a smaller club in England would try him but made no sense with Valencia despite his relationship with the owner or Phil having been there
Sigh I can t discuss about this objectively I m just fuming and scared of a possible relegation Everyday I m wondering what went through the peanut sized brain of Lim when offering Gary Neville the job I genuinely don t blame Neville I might sound like I am but that s mainly because I m very angry he got offered the job the experience of a lifetime and of course he d take it Also his players are letting him down Negredo could have won us today s game by 4 goals all by himself and he fucks up so many times But Neville is by no means a good manager and Peter Lim is a stupid dumbfuck loads of money 0 football knowledge
It sucks Liverpool has its history of shitty owners and it sucks watching them make the most ridiculous decisions to the detriment of your club I m sure Valencia won t get relegated though no way
Donald Trump exists
Donald Trump was born in one of NYCs wealthiest families and inherited millions of dollars Unless he spent thousands every day for decades it was always going to be guaranteed he would be an extremely rich man today Peter Lim however was the son of a fishmonger in Singapore And grew up in a life of poverty and ended up as a billionaire Certainly not through idiocy You are literally comparing a guy who was born with a diamond encrusted silver spoon in his mouth in one of the richest neighborhoods on earth to a guy who grew up with an 11 person family in a 2 bedroom living quarters in one of the poorest parts of Singapore
You can be clever in an economic sense and be stupid in footballing matters though like how Real Madrid fans view Perez
Woodward
Except no I wasn t comparing them your first comment implied that people can t be stupid if they re successful so I gave an example of a stupid but successful man I didn t say that he and Lim were in any way similar
Trump would have been richer if he d just dumped his dad s money into an index fund like 40 richer Trump s done a bunch of bad deals along some of his good ones See all of his bankrupt businesses
I hate trump as much as the next guy but that claim is an oversimplification It assumes that he inherited his dad s fortune in 1974 when he became president of his dad s company but he actually didn t Have access to that money until 1999 25 years later Source http www politifact com punditfact statements 2015 dec 09 occupy democrats occupy democrats say simple investment trumps fath
That s the 8B number There s other more credible variants on that theme closer to 4B which is still more than his net worth Note I said 40 not the 3x figure from the Occupy folks
He just got a small loan from his dad
1999 is 25 years later
Not saying I don t believe you at all but I d love to see some numbers on that just because heck maybe I should invest in index funds then
4 million in today s money
Pro tip inherit 200 million from your father
On it looks Damnit
I think I ll inherit 200 million Zimbabwean dollars from my father
Yeah no I guess that does change everything
Historically the market goes up by about 8 11 percent a year so index funds that track the market as a whole at fairly stable and profitable over the long haul There will be up and down years individually but if you leave your money in an index fund for 15 20 years you ll make a tidy return on it
http fortune com 2015 08 20 donald trump index funds The tl dr on beating the market is that you don t beat the market Meanwhile the S P 500 is up 13x since 1988 That s a hell of a return tl dr Invest early retire wealthy
He bankrupted a casino How fucking dumb do you have to be to bankrupt a fucking casino where people just give you money
A lot of casinos are running at a loss
Why Genuinely would like to know Is real estate that expensive in places like Reno and Vegas
He actually has very few bankruptcies compared to his couple hundred other successful businesses In fact I think only 4 businesses went bankrupt Pretty remarkable actually
It s possible to be both a shrewd businessman and outstanding idiot
You have to admit valencia have been unlucky in a lot of their matches If the goal was half a yard wider valencia would have won about 4 1 yesterday and previously the final finishing has cost them When it clicks though the team will be decent
deleted
Is it Any other managerial candidate like Biesla probably would ve brought their own staff I can t imagine Phil is all that valuable to the club considering he s been there for what a year Picking somebody who lacks the credentials b c there is a standing relationship there isn t justifiable
To be fair to him he had been coaching with England for a bit beforehand so it wasn t a complete shot in the dark on their part That said it probably would ve been smarter to pick someone more experienced
He had 0 experience as a head manager It was insane to offer him the job
While his decision to go there without an inkling of spanish knowledge was completely stupid to be fair he hasn t been able to impart his philosophy to the team because he simply can t communicate so he might be a good manager for all we know
More than business partners Lim seems to be manutd fan and has good relationship with cristiano as well
You need to understand who your owner is Peter Lim is a Manchester United fan always was always will be He has bought friendship with every one of the Class of 92 and Ronaldo in many ways he is the ultimate fan spending millions on the club he loves and no it s not Valencia He tried to buy Liverpool which makes more business sense as the EPL is a much bigger and profitable league than La Liga and also has a bigger following in Lim s home country territory If Giggs fails at United you can be sure he will be adopted by Valencia too Get used to the Spanish United
Lim got seduced by his punditry like most of r soccer
They have been business associates for a long time Doesn t excuse the idiocy but it s not just because Neville was a successful pundit
He is an UEFA pro certified coach that worked as coach and assistant manager for the English national team He was only doing punditry since it coincided well with his England job While he didn t have any club management experience it s not like he went straight from television to Valencia
That s not strictly true he got the England job off the back of his punditry as quoted by Hodgson But yes the tv was just a side gig alongside his coaching development
Because Lim is good friends with alot of the english speaking football community whereas he knows noone in the spanish side
He s not a pundit he s a treble winning rightback If he wasn t a pundit people would make less of a big deal out of it
Also on the coaching staff of England
You know I ve always wanted to ask a Valencia fan that Now I know what you think
Why did he get Phil on board to be his assistant I mean I get the brotherly chemistry they share but even the most casual observer here understands that the biggest obstacle to his success here is integrating with the squad and being able to communicate with the players effectively If I were him I d request the best bilingual Spanish and English assistant coach available who could then act as a conduit through which to transmit his ideas And no a translator would not cut it I firmly think you need someone familiar with the workings of a football club at a very high level in order to be able to perform such a role
Honest question Valencia fans if he wins you the copa del rey and at least doesn t get relegated would you want to stick with him Also Bielsa pls find a club soon
I think it s because they know each other personally Lim bought the 50 stake of Salford City off of the class of 92 in late 2014 One could assume that the lads were courted by Lim over dinners during negotiations and probably kept in touch with him as a mover and shaker in terms of club ownerships Seeing as he s not a football expert he maybe thought he d toss Gary a bone on this one I m conjecting a lot but maybe
I blaim Lim 100 This was a complete ego move Neville should have never been offered the position
You know its possible that Neville demonstrated strong manegerial skills in his interview for the position in addition to also being a good pundit for SKY Its not like its one or the other Its pretty common for former players to become managers Forget that Neville worked for SKY for 4 years he s another former player and one who actually has a brain and a tenacity to achieve in his life in every realm he attempts to in This was maybe an unusually big team to get a first managerial job in but besides that there is nothing out of the ordinary to having a 40 45 year old former player who has his coaching badges and experience being a coach on the England national team get a job as manager If this had worked Valencia would have been hailed as visionaries who snagged a top class manager first It looks like its not really working but I dont think it was an obvious blunder simply because he worked as a TV pundit for a period of time In hindsight you can make any decision seem idiotic
Hahaha I love this comment it s just so true Can t believe Valencia weren t ridiculed the minute they announced Neville would be manager it s absolutely insane
Cause they re a big club I mean how often would you have an opportunity like this If someone asked you to manage spurs would you take that job
Depends if I m planning on doing it for a few months and making off with the money or if I want to build a successful career in management If he s got any real ambitions to get into management a batshit choice like this job is going to be a stain on his reputation for a while
Not really There are plenty of reasons for him failing at Valencia its his first job and he wasn t ready for a such a big task he doesn t really speak Spainish etc If he is fired I still see a team in League 1 2 taking a punt on him he now has a level of experience communication will be much better and its a much easier job If he does well in the following 5 10 years at a couple of other clubs it will be easy to ignore his Valencia stint
Shit job won t take
Luis Enrique didn t do so well in his first managerial job and look where he is now It s Valencia s fault for hiring a non Spanish speaker as a manager not Neville s for trying to obtain some invaluable first team experience
He actually did well at Barca B then shit with Roma but then he did well again with Celta Vigo And now he s done amazingly well with Barca
I was counting Roma as his first real job You know a first division team and all
he said top flight club not tp club though
It s something he needs to build up to the chances of him succeeding at a club like Valencia with the experience he has was always low Different language different league it was always going to be tough for him Every manager stresses the importance of being able to communicate your ideas to the players That s why Pep learned German why Klopp said he wanted to go somewhere he knew the language
I won t if I am a Gary Neville wanting to establish my managerial career and I was asked to manage Spurs next season I will end up looking bad compared to Mauricio Pochettino and with the new stadium it s likely Spurs will have less money to spend in the next few years Chances are I ll give Spurs a 5th place finish and get sacked afterwards
Peter Lim is his mate
Mick McCarthy would have won at least one of those games
Jesus I don t think a man with that thick of a Yorkshire accent even has the capacity to learn Spanish
Bwaynos notchez lad off to pub Adidas
0 win percentage in La liga Ouch
A manager who can t speak the language to communicate with his players is not going to end well Especially with the lack of experience he has in management The bad part is we don t know of his management potential until he goes to a club he can control
Isn t players managers lacking a common language pretty common in modern top flight football I remember reading about how Van Gaal wanted everyone at United to speak English and Rooney saying that Spanish was becoming the dominant language in the dressing room
I d wager just about every single one of those managers started at place where they spoke the language Get the experience then go somewhere a bit more challenging Neville really did plunge into the deep end I feel sympathy for him but a lot more for the Valencia fans
Yeah I m not just talking about managers Generally lack of a common language is something that happens in modern football Surely the club must have some means for dealing with it Both Neville and his players must have some experience of dealing with that with their fellow players
Yeah that s true It is a global sport
Pep actually spend a year learning German to coach Bayern Coaches could do that if they are hired in good time
I m pretty sure Van Gaal speaks Spanish decently But there s a difference between lacking communication with some players and not speaking the language of the country the team s located in
he could and should go first to Salford City
But then who d sack him when results go bad
And all of a sudden we re 5 points from relegation I really can t see us not getting involved in relegation if Neville is still in charge But apparently it won t change Lim is a thick fucker and Neville said I can sleep well at night with this performance You can sleep well at night huh Yea of course you can this is a superb experience for you and you re even getting fucking paid for it driving us into the ruins We re crumbling our owner is a piece of shit and our manager is a fucking pundit See y all in Segunda next season
We ve had an injury list that makes the bible look like a short story and a manager who s had to pick up a broken dressing room yet in the past few weeks we ve started to play the best football we ve played in almost a year I honestly don t know how we lost to Sporting we were totally dominant as we should have been Gary can t make Negredo put the ball in the net he didn t tell him to miss open goal after goal and who saw that coming given he d scored 5 goals in his past 6 games With the recent performances and the team returning to full fitness I m confident we ll easily avoid relegation In fact I m backing us to beat Barca in the copa You might not like Gary and we definitely should have had a more experienced manager to help mentor our young team but we re stuck with him So back him
I have not seen Valencia at all this season but this is interesting to hear people only look at results but what is important is what happens on the pitch thats were Neville as a coach should be judged
Don t get me wrong there s still areas to improve on We can t seem to string more than a few passes together but that s to be expected when almost your full first team is out injured and you ve got a new style of play The results will come
How is the style of play different than before
Under Nuno we tried to play a quick counter attacking game winning the ball quite high up the pitch and breaking through Paco our wingers and Gaya It worked really well against teams that attacked us but left us clueless what to do when teams sat back which everyone had figured out at the start if this season Nuno tried to change it to a more possession based game but we didn t have the players for that and the players looked lost with the ball at their feet We would have several games in a row where we struggled to get shots on goal even in the 5 1 win over Celta we only had 5 shots on target Under Gary we try to play that counter attacking football again We re much quicker going from defence to attack often playing really risky first time balls This obviously leads to us losing possession a lot and being hit on the counter which is something Gary needs to work on but in his defence the Sporting game was the first time he d been able to play his first choice 11
Surely Valencia have enough technical gifted players in midfield to play a possession game Players like Parejo or Gomes
Parejo Gomes and Enzo could definitely fit into a possesion based system and Paco has shown that he thrives in one with Spain Our holding midfielder Javi Fuego just isn t cut out for it though He can break up play and move the ball on reasonably well but he isn t capable of controlling the game from deep That and our wide players like Piatti and Feghouli are traditional wingers who are much more comfortable running at full backs and putting a cross in
Piatti and Feghouli are not traditional wingers at all the are playmakers or no 10s played out wide at least they were previously What about Danilo in the dm position
Feghouli has been used exclusively as a traditional winger by several managers now The first thing he does when gets the ball is attempt to run at the opposite full back Danilo was bought as a back up DM and he s been neither of those things His positioning is awful and he can t tackle At all He s been so bad that Gary turned to Wilfred Zahibo one of our youth players to take his role whilst Fuego is out His best games with us have been when he s been allowed to drive forward and he s actually been fairly good in that role so he could have a bright future
Shouldn t have fired the other one
Hang in there Villa
3
I hope so but like I said the way the club is managed is so frustrating I don t want us and Levante get relegated would make the city in terms of football very dull
The last time we had such a streak of not winning a match in La Liga was 1986 Now guess when was the last time we got relegated
We won t be relegated The team s been riddled with injuries since he took over hence why Zahibo and Villalba have been starting games and the dressinf room was broken after Nuno Despite the results we ve been showing signs of life in recent weeks
They re five points off of Relegation and they still have to go to the Bernabeu and the Camp Nou and also have to host Atleti Villarreal and Sevilla It is not impossible
Yikes
I think you ll survive this season I m just shocked that your owners honestly thought a pundit would be a great manager
Almost the entirety of r soccer agreed with him Hell even now people are still making excuses for him firm in the belief that he ll be a world class manager I m not saying it won t happen but your first role being in a league you have zero experience with in a language you don t understand is never going to go well
Are we forgetting that Gary Neville was also a prolific footballer who played 400 games for one of the greatest teams of the modern era He also had 4 years as an England coach I keep seeing him referred to only as a pundit as if they dragged Martin Tyler or somebody with no real world experience into the job I m not saying it was the smartest decision It probably wasn t But Gary Neville isn t some wannabe footballer who they dragged out of obscurity
If anyone on here had actually done their coaching badges instead of being an armchair tactician they would appreciate how fucking hard it is and theres a natural filter for anyone clueless about football
Great footballers don t necessarily make good managers It s a non argument from your side
Not saying they do mate Every one of these Valencia threads features many comments that refer to Gary Neville as simply being a pundit which kind of understates what he s done in the game I can t believe they thought hiring a pundit was a good idea etc It s like if a team hired Thierry Henry and everyone went on about wow can you believe they hired a pundit as manager What were they thinking As if he s done nothing else in his career It s like yeah he was a pundit but that s a very short part of his life and he s done a lot more within football than just sit behind a desk dissecting gameplay You wouldn t know it though reading some of these comments you d think they d hired Martin Tyler as a manager someone who is literally only a TV commentator and nothing else That s the only point I m making There s no argument
Tbf Neville talks like he s Pep when he s actually Hodgson
You really can judge the guy s entire worth as a manager after his first ever 8 games at a big club to boot that are in a different country speak a different language and were already in poor form Interesting
Our fanbase is notorious but with Gary it s been unbelievable The hankerchiefs were out two weeks after he took over
You see it at a lot of clubs throughout Spain but Madrid do take it to another level
Lets wait to see how his career rolls out We shouldn t let this bad stint taint him
we should be friends
It is easy to comment or analyze a game between grandmasters after the fact than actually playing a game against them
Tactical insight is an important skill for a manager but it s only a small part of the job It was an absurd decision from both Valencia and Gary both should have known better Coach youth teams be an assistant try at a small club and then work your way up

I love how that is an actual picture of a DVD and not the box
I enjoyed that
I would just like to point out that my Valencia on FIFA is currently top of La Liga I ll be waiting by the phone Lim
In retrospect he probably should have started in the lower leagues
He should have started in a league where he could speak the language

This is the funniest comment I ve seen in this sub The last line is killer

A big club like Valencia should not have gone to someone as inexperienced as Gary Neville I mean that guy didn t even manage the Man Utd youth team let alone any club in England prior to moving there I know that the Valencia players are just not up for it this season but this would go down in history as one of the great examples of how theory Gary s analysis does not always translate into practice I can see his reasons for taking the job but I think this does more harm than good to his credentials
Was always a bit of an odd appointment I get he has links to Peter Lim already but to take a first step into management in a country where you don t even speak the language is one hell of a challenge I think he will make a decent manager eventually but he really dived in at the deep end and is struggling as a result
I ve watched a few of their games and as inexperienced as Neville is some of Valencia s players look genuinely terrible now
The Ben tez effect
What winning La Liga twice
Nah I guess I wasn t clear I meant what happened to madrid players at least IMHO with Benitez You don t give it all to a manager that doesn t win over the team And that s just judging Madrid s performance with Zidane in these first matches but it s a different team Just speaking in terms of attitude I m not saying either Benitez or Neville are bad managers I m saying it s about commitment to him Players will simply not perform with a manager they don t want And judging also by the tone of some Valencia fans that is the overall attitude I get towards Neville that they just don t want him I could be way off of course it s my interpretation of what s happening Because the talent is there
Negredo just gave up
They should stop fucking around and give Rafa a call
Don t blame him for taking the job It would be a hard to resist an opportunity like that He should have never been offered it in the first place though
This is too bad for Neville I semi hoped he ll do a decent job but apparently people telling that it was a wrong choice were right It was a little naive to believe that he ll turn from a pundit to a good manager Valencia is was definitely too early for him Now even the fans at least the comments I m reading here are turning against him It went from threads like How are Valencia doing to What is going on with Valencia and now this Perhaps he can revamp his career somewhere else but from the limited amount of what I ve seen of them this season they are just playing horribly
Those who can do it those who cant analyze
This is actually so true Shearer Souness Keane probably more examples of people who failed as managers so they went to punditry
That being said Neville has had 8 fucking games in one club Let s not write off his entire managerial prospects based on such a small sample
Harsh about Shearer The guy was doomed from the start
Keane did ok at Sunderland too I say ok because he was bankrolled every step of the way but to be fair to him he delivered
I don t think it s him even being a bad manager I think it s mostly the languge barrier
Love him as a pundit but I must say I love it when things like this happen Just shows that talking and criticizing football tactics on TV is a walk in the park compared to actually doing it on the touchline It s like watching an idols judge try to sing
Lol it so hilarious to watch everyone dragging Neville through the mud after 8 games as if ANY manager wouldve come into this mess of a club and made them into title contenders or something Like honestly Valencia havent been good for awhile they bring in a relatively inexperienced manager mid season and some of you expect him to turn Valencia into Barcelona I can almost guarantee Neville knows more about football as a whole than basically anyone that posts on this subreddit The jury is still out Neville could end up being a flop as a manager but thats to be seen AT THE VERY LEAST after a full season
We were 1 point away from 3rd place last season No one expects Neville to turn us into Barcelona but we expect a replacement manager to improve our game and get us back into Europe positions which has been the opposite Last time we got rid of a coach mid season his replacement beat Barcelona at Camp Nou
Well that s not the point is it It s the irony of it all I guarantee you that if Neville was doing punditry for matches involving this same Valencia side playing the exact same way he would be scathing
I think that s being a bit harsh especially considering the last game Neville cannot make Negredo put the ball in the net but he can set up the team to get them to the final third They should have won at least 3 0 against Sporting but I wouldn t say the reason for the draw was managerial He s still finding his feet So if he was scathing he d probably direct it towards players
Is there a reason why the language is such a huge issue for Gary Neville I mean we ve seen dozens of managers manage very successfully across Europe outside of their linguistic motherland Ancelotti has managed in Spain England and France Capello in Spain and England Mourinho in Spain and England Guardiola in Germany etc etc Is this inability to communicate with other Europeans an English thing If not is the language issue a complete red herring and Neville is just a plain bad coach Genuinely curious
I remember when Neville called Wenger deluded Oh how the tables have turned I ve seen a lot of Neville not just of SKY but also on videos where he talks about his future careers in and outside football People call the vibe he gives off self belief but like Neville said about Wenger there a time when self belief becomes delusion and that s exactly what s happened to Neville
Very poor going with that squad at your disposal
I suspect he s got the potential to be a very good manager but taking that particular job when he couldn t speak any Spanish was incredibly shortsighted not to mention Phil being his assistant when he s about as useful as a chocolate tea pot This was destined to be a disaster If he intends to pursue management any further he would do himself a huge favour to come back to England and start somewhere outside the Premiership
Can t wait till he s back on MNF slagging off Wenger for those obvious mistakes he makes
And he had the audacity to call Wenger naive
Serious relegation standards If he turns it around from here he will have some serious management credentials Big word that if though
Still get the England job
Wish he d come to Fulham
So he could go eight games without a win there too
I still think he can be a top manager Or head coach
He knew he wasnt ready for this He said himself Maybe in 10 years time with more experience
Who was the genius that hired him in the first place
Can anyone tell me what was the reasoning behind his hiring This guy was brand new at coaching and someone gave him a big club in a delicate situation and expected him to do well He should ve starter with a smaller team with less expectations and less pressure
I think that due to the size of the club he was always going to be under intense scrutiny It has still been a relatively short time since he was appointed I know that boards have itchy trigger fingers these days but sacking him now would be a total waste of time They need to give him some more time
I want to see Pellegrini get the spot here I am sure he can bring Valencia back to his winning days or bring Rafa Benitez I am sure the fans would love this since he did so well with them
What if Gary Neville is only a cup manager
I d not blame Neville at least not in the first place The team performance is just terrible I d score more goals than Negredo
Lets make excuses for his failure because we liked his analysis
To be fair he s taken them to the semis of the Copa del Rey

Anyone know who the 11million second division player is I d be interested to see how his career goes Edit Looking on Transfermarkt one team paid 7mil for a Brazillian but no one has spent over 3mil on a Chinese player Error in the article perhaps

Makes sense He s not Chinese though which the article states he is

As an American I really hope we can get behind soccer like the rest of the world I m a military brat that got to live in different countries and for the life of me can t understand why it s not big here EDIT removing replies as I see there s an issue with cheering for a team if you live in another country Oh Reddit bring on the downvotes Mwahahahaha
It all has to do with television exposure Up until the early 2000s it was very difficult to watch any top games couple that with the MLS only starting in 1995 Remember soccer is the most popular youth sport in the United States by some distance and this will continue to grow as a result of concussion fears from football The key is keeping young kids interested in the sport as they transition to their young teenage years which is where there is a huge drop off in participation in the US I think the fact the EPL games and CL games are so easy to watch now will help with that fact In addition I think the US federation is spending on development I think the USMNT and the general quality of American players will greatly increase over the next generation let s say in 20 years
Thank you for a legit response not bullshit about why I root for who I do I really hope we can get it together and become a viable option for international stars
More colleges supporting soccer and scholarships would help to I m the south there s hardly any college soccer for men here therefor no highschools have boys soccer and only have girls teams to balance out the football scholarships
theres a lot of usa military in Germany
Yea but it s still kind of ironic
Not so much He could ve been born in Germany The USA has bases in Bavaria If you ve ever been around the military you can find entire groups that speak German as a first language conversing
I had replies explaining but realized it was pointless I really didn t want this to focus on why an American is cheering for a German team I honestly want American soccer to do better
American Soccer can do better but if you don t pay attention to it You aren t really helping
I ve already explained this
Then rock your FC Dallas flair
The season hasn t even started yet There is nothing to pay attention to
Family is German lived in Germany as a kid What does it matter to you though
That you support a foreign club yet you wonder why the sport is not big in America and want them to be like the rest of the world
This and literaly everyone here claims to have German or Irish parents They probably do but it s a weird thing to support a team because your great grandfather was a German who came to America
Not when your parents are German and you were born in Germany Jesus fucking Christ This isn t the same as someone saying I m 1 8th this 1 8th that 1 4 Moroccan etc etc It s a fucking spectrum not black and white And the idea that people have to defend immigrant culture is baffling to me and shows that r soccer is in general filled with children
The good news is that you won t run into any of these people outside since they never leave their basement
I just need to know one thing do you support some American soccer team If not I really can not take your comment that you hope we can get behind it seriously
Yes I ve been rooting for FC Dallas for years It s just when I was young my mom was stationed in Germany and I had no access to American sports so I cheered for the team my family did naturally
But isnt spending like this what they tried in the US prior to the MLS which didnt work eventually
Partly There was a boom in soccer interest the US and the league did two things Bought up players for exorbitant amounts and expanded like crazy the crazy expansion played the biggest part imo in the collapse of the old NASL 9 Teams in 1973 15 by 1974 20 by 1975 24 by 1978 Interest in soccer started dropping and so did the teams
Yeah that s how the old NASL collapsed
in the words of the mighty Wu Tang Clan Cash Rules Everything Around Me
Money Xi Jinping gave football green light support from both government and provincial level so that means there must be huge official salaries maybe huge unofficial too Also this same question can be asked why let say former South American players go to Midle east and not in BRA ARG leagues Money rules the world and they are playing football for salaries Yes part of them 20 might choose succesfull team or team with great support of fans over team without it with 20 better salary but rest of them majority will always go for higher salary
So basically money I would prefer the MLS to continue to raise homegrown players than drop millions on players over the hill anyway

So there can be more conversations about why the Gerrard Lampard midfield does doesn t work No thank you
Except the reason would be different this time Both of them are too old now to be very mobile and won t track back to defend after they attack wait a minute
Nah He s going to China
England s golden generation can finally win something together
and what did they achieve FA
Hopefully Chelsea do what Liverpool did with Gerrard and commit the remainder of the season to Terry s goodbye tour abandoning the competitive element in the process
lol
They already started that
Worst Season Ever
Well I liked it
Me too thanks
The end was alright I guess
Oh it was more then alright
I want to come back to this thread a year for now for the bantz
We were in contention for top 4 until the maybe last 2 3 games The Hodgson days were much darker
I disagree with you from an emotional standpoint It was heart wrenching watching Rodgers select Gerrard match after match when he was obviously in a poor spell The narrative that followed all of it and Gerrard s comments in the media regarding his eminent departure left me feeling hollow and angry It hurt so much watching Gerrard demand more playing time when you knew the best thing for him was to sub in What was worse was Rodgers blind subservience to the cult of personality that is Gerrard A manager has to be the bad guy sometimes and I feel the emotional resonance Gerrard had on Liverpool at the time made it impossible for that season to be anything but a train wreck knowing that Rodgers is not the manager inclined to ruin the ending of an epic poem Too much character in the whole thing EDIT spelling
Difference being that Ferguson was obviously doing a good job so the fans weren t going to question too many of his decisions Can t really say the same thing about Rodgers it s not like he d solidified his reputation enough to risk something like dropping Gerrard I suppose
Yeah overall he was good at turfing people out at the right time but some of the decisions seemed mad from the outside Jaap Stam was still world class for years after leaving
Stam was a different story It wasn t about a player who was past it but an offer that was incredibly good Lazio did pay a lot of money for him In hindsight it would have probably been better to keep him but it wasn t some unjustified decision or a result of a conflict
He fell out with Stam though it wasn t necessarily because he was past it
But still come the last few games of the season Gerrard was the only one scoring and that was winning us points
That red card vs Man U though
Terry red card within 10 seconds incoming
Hey man lets not get crazy it was 22 seconds
Does this retirement tour also end with us beating them at home Maybe in a cup match
Not sure what you mean You ve only got one more cup game to turn up to this season and it aint against Chelsea
Would do if Adebayor weren t comin fo yo ass
You get Spurs in the cup just after signing Adebayor Draw is obviously rigged
It s not life just writes itself like this when Adebayor needs a new contract
It didn t end there
I didnt know they had a competetive element this season
only to roll it into the new manager welcoming party the next season which is like having the longest pre season ever
We d be happy to beat them 6 1 if it helps
Mourinho and Terry gone in one season This is definetely the worst season of all
And Cech
Drogba as well then
worst by an absolute fucking mile Jesus Christ there had better be some changes in the summer
Don t forget Ramires
Ashley Cole and Terry hitting up LA The ultimate lads on tour Lock up yo wives Americans
He s definitely the right age to get picked up by Galaxy
He d actually be a pretty good signing for an MLS side Good professional still able to cut it at the highest level incredibly experienced That s if he s not retiring of course
That s what people were saying about Gerrard Not fit enough for the PL anymore but his experience would be great for the MLS And look how it turned out At 35 very few players can have a positive impact even at the MLS
While fitness and legs are more important for a midfielder centre backs can still perform at a high level if they have an athletic one alongside them When Per can Terry can
Mertesacker has never had any level of pace to speak of though He s never been able to rely on being as fast as any striker Old age is a much bigger hit to players like Terry who have had at least some level of pace
Terry s pace was never the highlight of his skillset though He always relied more on tactical awareness and positioning to defend In fact he was often the slow one compared to his best partners Carvalho Luiz Cahill Zouma
He s not Per Mertesacker though He can at least keep up with some people Mertesacker s game is built around not needing any pace whatsoever
Drogba s 37 and he s doing very well If he had come in at the beginning of the season he probably would have won the golden boot Gerrard didn t take the league seriously and treated it like a vacation That s why he flopped
Nah Travel pace and considering his age is starting to show MLS would not be good to him Maybe if he only played home games The travel is an underrated factor in MLS and it tends to have an effect on older players not prepared Don t get me wrong he d be probably the best defender in the league but I m not sure he could handle the travel on top of the general pace of the game
Traveling in the premier league must be fun You could drive to an away game and drive back to have dinner
No joke 3 hour drive in America you won t even leave your state 90 of the time 3 hour drive in Europe you can hit 2 3 countries Source done it haha
aren t his knees almost shot though already a couple years ago there were those quotes of his that were saying he basically had no cartilage left and he was struggling to force himself to get out there
His body is shot tbh He was notorious for playing through injury and any pain during his career because he wanted to put on the shirt and play for Chelsea every week Personally I still rate him as a world class CB who can cut it in the Premier League so I dunno why Chelsea are cutting him loose You could even just rotate him and bring him out for easy games against Norwich if you re worried he is in terminal decline Still if he does leave I would like to see him go to Italy where the speed of the game is slower and the style of play suits his biggest strengths anticipation positioning and all round reading of the game
Oh God Can we please not see yet another superstar go to Galaxy
John Harkes already took care of wives in the 90s we re used to it
You could say Harkes did very well on the wife circuit
Fuck it we ll play with 12 men on the field
Pls no
lol as long as they dont bring Ryan Giggs along
Why One of Chelsea s problems this season is that they ve been lacking leaders in the dressing room after Cech and Drogba departed now they re throwing their captain leader legend away That does not make a whole lot of sense to me
Our board appears to be a mess This is bullshit
This season is how many ways can this club disappoint me
Every week you think now this is the peak But wait NO
We ve decided to change the home color to red and change our lion to a dragon

lmao that is horrendous
He should be fired just for that
Fucking crime against humanity that should be sent to the Hague to answer for that atrocity
oi
They ve been dropping the ball all season Why the fuck they won t give him a contract he s been playing well for the last few months
Wasn t he one of the last Jose die hards I can only imagine there s been all kinds of issues backstage this year
I think this season is probably seen as one of transition from the old to the new Ramires has been sold Jose has gone Remy seems to have one foot out of the door It ll be a very different Chelsea that starts next season and maybe the board see Terry as one of the last of the Chelsea old guard
Ivanovic is still here tho hell he got a contract extension I get the transition but you still need experiences leaders there to make the transition smooth which Terry can do
Ivanovic signing an extension means nothing See Ramires
We all know he loves Jose maybe the dressing room is not in a good place right now after he left and they all still don t like that he s not around Part of me thinks they want to get rid of those who are still holding the old mentality particularly around Jose and his status
You said it ll be a very different Chelsea but previously stated that two squad rotation players in Remy and Ramires were are leaving Makes very little difference certainly doesn t constitute a very different Chelsea They certainly buy a 1st choice CB probably Stones But other than that I can t see much else changing maybe another 1st choice fullback
This is exactly it He s quite obviously not the future of the club If he stayed then he d want to play the fans would want him to play for sentimental reasons it just wouldn t progress He needs to leave to make a clean break Or just retire and move towards the coaching staff but why not get that final ludicrous paycheck abroad It makes sense for all parties
I highly doubt Terry will remain inactive in the leadership of our team Just like Didier is still very active with our team right now
Long term I see him coming back to the club in a coaching capacity or something
It d be a lot of fun to have Cech Terry Lamps and Drogba all come back as coaches Keeper Defender Midfield Striker coaches for years to come
Cause he s old and becoming a liability to Chelsea s defense Not rocket science
Bad day for people called Terry
I m expecting some dreary news about Deary by midnight
It s terryble
Miazga pushing him out s
No I think it s Djilobodji
The Departed Chelsea Edition
big up
He s got about half a year to absorb all the Terry knowledge he can
Haiti flair Woah
This is fucking bullshit Ivanovic gets a new contract with option for one more year and Terry gets none Fuck off
Brana is 31 Terry is 35 There s also a chance that he is ready to retire and this decision is mutual
The latter might be true But don t let numbers fool you Terry is comfortably a more useful player than Brana both on and off the pitch If Ivanovic is offered a new contract then why not Terry
The numbers aren t fooling me it s just a simple matter of how much time they potentially have left Brana could go on being useful for another 2 3 years whereas I can t see us playing an almost 39 year old Terry can you
One of the reasons people were fine with Ivanovic getting an extension was that he s a veteran and we could use that leadership in the locker room even if he s relegated to a bench player depth role Why not the same for Terry I really doubt that Terry after two decades with the club isn t willing to take a depth role
Maybe because Terry wants to play regularly
atm Terry is more useful to the team than Ivanovi I don t see any reason to not give him one year contract extension if Ivanovi got it No one claims that Terry is going to play for chelsea at 39 but that doesn t mean that he can t play now
Ivanovic isn t too old to play centerback but he s definitely getting too old to play fullback You need a lot more pace and stamina at fullback Obviously you don t need great pace to play centerback considering some of the world s best aren t that fast
So maybe Ivano is meant to replace Terry Then buy a new left right back Maybe a new leftback and push Azpi out on the right
Ideally I would have loved to stay but the club s moving in a different direction Source
He s said he will continue to play
WHY THE FUCK NOT HE IS STILL STARTING
But he ll be 36 during next season and not exactly the rock at the back you re used to this year I m certain the club will be very forceful in signing a top replacement
Doesn t matter Obviously I don t know for sure but I would be very surprised if he wanted to do anything else than retire a Blue whether that meant starting or having a smaller role on the bench
Regardless of age he s the kind of player that you keep on the squad even if he gets less playing time he s the leader of the club and the most respected man in the organization While I ll always support this club and love it the decisions this board has made this season from sacking Mourinho to this is going to leave a bad taste in my mouth for a long time
Age doesn t matter when he has so much to give outside of playing And by basing off of recent transfer activity we ll spend the summer chasing Stones Marquinhos Boateng whoever else and wind up spending 8m on a CB most have never heard of Can t imagine an elite CB would want to come here unless we have CL and that s going to be a really difficult ask
Unless their name is Matt Miazga
Is he really an elite CB though I ve not really seen him so I can t say but he s not really played a lot of football at the highest level seems a bit of a stretch to say he s that world class tier of defender just looking at that
No he was just joking because we are so hyped about him in America
Oh thank God didn t want to seem rude but could not see the justification Thanks
Miazga is simulatneously world class and loan club shit He is the r soccer paradox
Schr dinger s Centerback
Plot twits They re sign Huth
Be interesting to see where he goes be weird to see him at another Prem team so abroad perhaps MLS maybe
He said not to another PL team but still wants to continue playing
Let s just hope he doesn t go to one of the CFG teams and gets loaned to mcfc that would be just wonderful
China I thought he was supposed to be popular there and Sven Goran Erikssen seems to want ageing English stars word has it he wants Wayne Rooney on his team
LA Galaxy will probably come calling
joins Jose at man united
Honestly i d be happy for Terry if the club are stupid enough to get rid of him against his will then he deserves to go somewhere he can play and be happy Just like Lampard and Cech
Literally what the actual fuck kind of heartbroken right now
This will be such a big loss for the club He s more than just a player on the field he s a club icon He s important for the identity of the club and without him we miss a huge presence in the club and the dressing room
I m not ready
I suspect that means they ll go all out for stones in the summer
Nah he s shit now did you not see the Merson rant
I ve never rated him
Wenger never tried to sign him
John Stones was never my friend
No way is Stones and Zouma our centre back pairing next season
Zouma and Dragovic
didnt say they would be did i I said they ll try harder to sign him
That s insane Why are they not renewing his contract And where will he go I think he should just retire end his career with Chelsea
Seriously what is up with Chelsea just giving up on players when they re old instead of renewing their contract for a final year or two and letting them retire I understand Drogba still had a few in him and chose to go to Turkey and MLS but Lamps and Terry Just let them retire at Chelsea ffs
They ve been renewing JT on those exact one or two year deals for 5 years now I still think he had another year but the wages he asks for the role he wants and the direction of the club are all taken into account Its not as if he is offering to play for free next season and the club is telling him to fuck off He still wants to play week in week out for at least another 2 3 years and at the wages he commands Chelsea isn t willing to commit to that As heartbreaking as it is and again I d prefer to give him another year I understand it It is probably better to part ways a year too soon than a year too late
Do you think that this season qualifies as a year too late
No I think this is the year too early I think he could still play a big role for us for another year I don t like the decision but I do understand it
This is a fucking disgrace He is the club captain and still starting ffs I hope he retires can t bear to see him play anywhere else
He ll go to a MLS club but then spend half of next season playing for either Man United or Tottenham Not sure which rival club is left that our stupid fucking board wants to send our legends to
Well he said he won t play for another English team so hopefully he would turn down a loan offer like that
Shame he s going out on a season like this Say what you want about him but he s a good player
If Terry stays Cahill probably has to leave
Let him leave Terry is still much better than him and is an amazing leader on and off the field
He was the bridge between angry supports and a heated Board of Directors that bridge is now burned
This will be the worst decision the club has made including sacking Mourinho this season if this goes through
That s too dumb
Soo LA Galaxy
Fucking disgrace I don t understand why they would let a club legend leave so easily Just keep him around anyway he doesn t even need to play to be useful
The board is willing to take Falcao s massive wage but isn t willing to pay the club captain at his current wage This season is so great
Silly move You ve already seen the impact of a lack of leaders has had on United and Liverpool I would have kept him around especially as he s still very serviceable
Terry to MLS confirmed
weird from the club considering he s the last remaining legend I can think of
Brave leader
Terry has long personified everything good about Chelsea Passion Desire The never say die spirit Brotherhood and old fashioned values Yet time waits for no man The legs are going the fire in his eyes undimmed yet the body screams for rest But it s a crying shame that a man who has given everything in service to English Football is so despised by its fans it s fans who would rather base their opinion of a footballer on what they read in Hello magazine rather than what they see on the pitch But Chelsea fans know When his service is ended when the tears are flowing on that last day I shall ll be saluting with the rest of The Bridge Thanks for everything Terry Captain Leader Legend
Jesus fucking Christ what is this drivel It s written like an A level student
It s a copy and paste from Spamduster a notorious guy on the Guardian football section the guy is hilarious tbh
Cringe isn t it Wouldn t surprise me if this guy wrote fan fiction about John Terry naked in the showers
Mate is he your dad or something Leave it out
I just vomited all over my screen you fuck
Christ he s not died lad
Also personifies everything bad about Chelsea
No player personifies everything about Chelsea both good and bad better than Terry and no manager better than Mourinho And our board got rid of both within a couple of months Sad times
Christ alive what the fuck is this
What the actual fuck did I just read
This is probably for the best Let go of club legends before they fall off a cliff you look likes dicks for benching them
We have no leaders besides him Please don t reply to me saying Ivanovic and Fabregas are leaders They fucking aren t leaders
Especially not Fabregas
Azpi
Good shout
I m genuinely curious but hasn t Brana been a popular guy in the dressing room for years and is currently Vice Captain Why isn t he considered a leader then Yeah he had his bad run in 2015 and isn t the player he was a couple of years ago but he s still hugely experienced I agree with Cesc not being a leader The ultimate example of a luxury player him
You don t see him on the field He s constantly whining shouting at other players when he fails to track his man Recently also it happened he wandered forward failed to track his man Zouma did his job and still got shouted at by Ivanovic It really isn t a sign of a leader
You dont look like a dick for benching a legend when he gets old You look like a dick if you push him out of the club
Legends who understand this and leave with dignity Xavi Legends who don t understand this and make fools of themselves when they are clearly in decline and fail to see this Iker
Adios

To add some background The referee Bibiana Steinhaus injured herself at half time Since they didn t have a fourth referee they asked through the stadium microphone if there was anyone with a referee license So after a while this guy came up who is basically a Sunday league referee The 3rd division is quite popular i e this game was attended by 6k fans but fortunately he did not make any significant mistake
additional information They asked for somebody who can officiate in the Oberliga 5th tier and they got somebody who already officiated three Oberliga Westfalen 5th tier league games this season
Yeah it s not like they brought in someone who is completely new to being a linesman If you are a 5th tier referee you are already pretty good
Stark contrast from the PL
where you can be a 1st tier referee and still utterly shit
That s a cheeky smile
She liked it
Is it a straight red if a less charming fellow does it still accidentally of course
Well it s a straight red either way just depends on whether it s a card or her cheeks
Steinhaus takes a lot of personal shit before sending somebody off There was a game where Pep just wouldn t stop getting touchy with her either and I was sure he was going to be sent to the stands but she basically just ignored him while he was in her face for minutes
Does she get a lot of shit male referees wouldn t don t get
Nah It was a game where Guardiola was very unhappy with the officiating and like any coach he took it to the 4th official I m certain Pep would ve shouted at a male just the same way I assume she gets sexist remarks every now and then but not because people are actually sexist but because they want to shit on the ref similarly to how some call Webb a bald cunt There was recently a case of a Fortuna D sseldorf player that said some very sexist insults towards her and he got punished for it To be fair she just sent him off with his 2nd yellow so he told her women have no place in the sport He said he s sorry and his own club sent him to ref some youth level women games as punishment plus a fine The DFL further banned him for 2 games as he was a first time offender for anything like that
Good write up thanks I feel like people generally build up thick skin over whatever people use for personal attacks though is a woman seems like it would get pretty frustrating if it s at all frequent for her I love the creativity of sending the player to ref girls games as a punitive measure especially if the girls are okay with it
Yeah he took it very serious
Not a lot of I d say but slightly more and in a different way I took a seminar from my university at a UCL level football club from Germany and when they were asked things about gender equality you could feel how male dominated this sport still is on management level despite turning into a business
Don t think she does though I haven t paid too much attention to her specifically I don t follow 2 Bundesliga half as much as the 1 since I don t have a team in it and she isn t employed as a main referee in 1 Bundesliga games but only as an assistant 4th official
The DFL German referees have a grade system and the best ones get to ref Bundesliga the next best ones 2nd Bundesliga etc Steinhaus is upper midfield for 2nd Bundesliga refs which is actually really good that makes her like a top 25 ref in Germany Referees that get to be main ref at a lower tier are allowed to assist at a higher that s kinda how it s ranked If you can do a game like Kaiserslautern N rnberg on your own you might as well assist for Woflsburg Hoffenheim However since her grades aren t good enough she doesn t get promoted to 1st Bundesliga simple as that Still makes her the best female ref around right now sadly the German women NT is really great and takes any chance for her to ref an international final away since she s not allowed to ref against the team that knocked us out I think as well as German games Which is the case for any WC or EC final in the past decades
Rules number one and two always apply
Did I break either or both I legitimately wanted to know if the occurrence in the clip was something a referee could take actual action against if they didn t laugh it off Community rules community guidelines or submission guidelines I ve enjoyed the discussion about German refereeing and don t understand why my question is where you ve felt the need to mention this TLDR Whoosh
He means those rules Be attractive Don t be unattractive
Rules 1 Be attractive 2 Don t be unattractive
Off topic Is Bibiana a common name Ive only met one other so im surprised to see another
Not really common no At least in Germany
Things will never be the same
Dude it s not like the 4th referee was missing There is no 4th official in 3rd league
yea thats his point
No I don t think it is He s referring to a perceived unusual unprofessionality in Germany compared to his experiences with the Brazilian league And I corrected that assumption
Actually that was my point But anyway I don t even know if our 3rd division has the 4th referee It was just a joke
We do have actually
As a child I used always take a linesman s flag to games and dream that maybe one day This might happen to me
Get your boob touched
Andy Gray is sitting in Dubai having a laugh

Thank you edge
I remember something similar happening in a different match recently anyone remember what it was
Are you thinking of this http www theguardian com football 2015 aug 27 michael oliver crowd arsenal ladies linesman
That s so fricking cute though they have a little referee family If their kids are gonna be referees too that s gonna be weird but still fricking cute
Lucy Oliver for anyone interested
Hot damn I d let her blow my whistle
It s boob touched ref
Yup I reckon she s pretty well known in Germany cause she s one of the only women reffing matches in edit top men s leagues Wiki page here
She s good I like her
She s excellent Shame she s not allowed to officiate BuLi matches we need every decent ref we can get
Yeah sadly her fitness results arent high enough for the BL cause she is a pretty good ref some of the BL refs are so awful
She s really good A true shame but I think she ll be allowed d soon
Probably the only ref that s not universally hated in our stadium
She has that Klopp esque look
Love shit like this
That s what budget cuts would do to anyone p
Similar thing happened this weekend in Woking vs Barrow Linesman was knocked out when the ball hit him in the face After a 15 minute delay the fourth official ran the line and a fan took over as fourth official
The legend that was Jimmy Hill ran the line at Highbury for Arsenal v Liverpool in 1972 after a tannoy call http www arsenal com news news archive tv pundit jimmy hill runs the line
Ughh I always turn up late to Sunday league games to avoid getting the linesman job nobody listens to the poor cunt
Are you too shit to start then
I m in the fine establishment of Saturday league my friend

God I just had flashbacks to when I liked KSI and co
Man those RTD1 series were fucking class
that ivory coast one was hype so stoked when he finally done it
Black men Black men run faster then you ve ever run before Seems silly now but I remember dying watching that the first time
That s because we were rooting for him to make D1 or whatever because he constantly and hilariously failed the when he finally achieved it it made it that much sweeter
Oh man that was a great video Doumbia scored against ya watcha gonna dooooooooooooo
Yea those were the days Sucks he does not do them anymore
It s a shame that the more popular he got the less FIFA videos he created Fair play to him for his success though
Yeah that s what happens with youtubers as the money rolls in its hard for them to stick to their old stuff
I always find people on youtube who have like around 10k subs and once they get around 60 100k I just leave because I usually see them just becoming so generic and overproduced even with niche interests Lionheartx10 is a total war commentator and I subscribed at 3k I left at around 95k because he started advertising shit and had sponsors it wasn t nice to see
Can you blame them If you were in their position and were offered sponsorships and stuff would you decline those offers Probably not For many popular YouTubers their channel is their living so they have to take every opportunity for earning money
They re providing you with entertainment for free They should get paid for doing something that takes a lot of their time to create Who cares if they say this video brought to you by or use this discount code at It s not selling out its called making a living
I think his point is it loses its intimacy at that point which is fair to say He s not saying they shouldn t just that it doesn t interest him when it gets to that stage
watch PoM or Heir then maybe even Diplex
I watch PoM he hasn t changed a lot if ever since I came across him about 4 years ago used to watch Diplex but he vanished never really liked heir
Diplex always posts just random games and mods nowadays seem like he s doing it more for his own entertainment than a story for example
Must have a look then he vanished for about 5 months he was in the army or something
FIFA is pretty boring now anyway I understand why he stopped and his old videos were gold anyway
Well the gameplay was never really the entertaining thing about KSI But his brilliantly bad editing combined with his personality was so good
idk how far back you watched you used to watch but the gameplay was definitely entertaining
Well in my opinion the gameplay was made entertaining by him commentating and editing over it But opinions differ of course
I think he s talking about way before KSI got big when he just used to upload goal comps Had some good goals in there
For some reason i don t find FIFA entertaining unless i am playing it myself
If you have a childish sense of humour id recommend good ol georges road to to glory series from fifa 13 Its the only one that has enough content besides gameplay to make it genuinely entertaining
It was hour long streams that he d do and finally get a toty only to realise said toty goes for nothing and KSI proceeds to cry
his gta videos with the sidemen are hilarious definately check it out
The ones without him are hilarious as well
EMINEKEEEE
BEASTTTTT
Theyre just so outrageously fake You can tell the fame got to KSIs head too
Eh Some are almost beyond obviously fake but some are pretty genuine and funny now He s not at funny as he was back in the FIFA 13 and before days but he s not the sequel to Hitler like some think
It s funny if you ever see one of the interviews he s done where he s not being KSI then he comes across as this very down to earth sensible guy kinda odd to see him like that tbh
He suffers from the same thing I have with PewDiePie in that I don t like KSI the character but JJ the guy is fine Except that I actually watch some KSI from time to time and avoid PewDiePie like a Plague because it s not my cup of tea
There are a few you tubers who do a pretty solid job as far as having personality and being genuine about it
Personally Im a fan of FIFARalle He seems like a nice and genuine guy Castro can also be a bit exaggerated in his reactions but I feel like he his personality is genuine and he comes off as a really cool guy
Can t stand Castro personally He may be genuine but he s genuinely obnoxious Spencer FC is a pretty good presenter and entertaining and I like his content and personality far more Ralle is great Love his streams as well as his youtube series
For the life of me I can t remember his name but there was a guy english chap who used to have a Fifa channel The only thing I can remember is he used to have a segment called Teatime or some shit he always drank tea Any idea who that is
ChrisMD
Not the one Im after the one Im thinking about was quite the awkward looking chap Matter of fact he used the word chap quite alot Edit literally just googled How to slurp tea fifa iRaider2k11 seems to have been his name http youtu be NYzP8E wTGw
Fake in what way
The reaction to packs and stuff like that
Ah yea Kids love it though
The other sidemen do better pack openings nowadays imo especially TBJZL and Zerkaa They re way more genuine no fake over the top reactions
There seems to be a rather fast black man headed straight for goal
Why do people find pride in putting people down KSI stopped posting as much FIFA content but he s living the life now If you don t find his content enjoyable now that s fair No need to be an ass about it
How is he putting KSI down He s just saying
He implies that watching KSI is worth of cringe or something
Yeah this is interesting If the people who hate KSI now were in his position they d take the money no question Though self admittedly he s not good at FIFA anymore Everybody got better over time and honestly I buy that more than him selling out
He was never the best FIFA player though He was ridiculous online but pretty much did poorly against other top FIFA youtubers

You dont have to Just say Premier League EVERYONE knows what youre talking about No need to abbreviate it
Yeah used to always watch him then I turned 16
weird how you use and then I turned like you re all grown up but if I was talking to you outside people would assume I m your dad or a nonce
Don t help when you ve been arrested for grooming though does it mate
The point was that at even 16 which is still a kid became too old to watch his videos 16 is not grown up thats the joke
I always found him fucking retarded I don t know why people think screaming is funny it s cringy as fuck
I like KSI
Fair enough I don t really care I just find him annoying as fuck
deleted
Don t say that you tit
I hope he plays well for WHU because I never want to see him in Fenerbahce jersey again
Haha all the comments from Turkey have been terrible Is he really that shite Bare in mind we had Carlton Cole for a long time when you answer
He s possibly one of the worst players I have ever seen play for one of the three biggest teams in Turkey There have been jokes in Turkey that his transfer to West Ham will be cancelled when they find out in his medical he has no brain He s really really dumb footballing wise I don t know him personally
Haha brilliant
He said tears streaming down his cheeks
everything has been a bit competent and predictable of late no way to celebrate the final year in our home which has cradled so many basket cases and walking liabilities
for all my love of carlton cole I always wanted him to be twice as fast nigerian potentially pushing 40 and with more baggage than easyjet
Carlton Cole actually has Nigerian heritage
don t we all mate don t we all
judging by his instagram and twitter he is not very intelligent in his personal life too
Any truth to the rumors that he was born in 1978 Seems like a load of shit but then again I don t know anything about him
Don t reckon he s 38 but fairplay if you re still that fast at that age
Yeah you re right after you turn 35 in the Prem they take you out behind the barn and put you down Or send you to MLS
In Gerrard s case they did both
WTF haha hilarious
bahahahahahaha 404 brain not found
Not just shitty The guy gets a tap in pass while he is one meter in front of the goal but he tries to pull off some majestic flick or something skyrocketing the ball He didn t get play time because he played like shit and when he plays he doesn t look motivated at all so people got tired of him and started booing him Then he leaves the pitch while our coach couldn t get him in line If he is motivated and plays well he ll tear apart any physical league But I think he considered himself to be the absolute star Just make your freaking goals and if you don t get in the starting 11 work harder Any money we get for him at this point is a good deal for us Fernandao is more or less the same type of player but quite a lot cheaper and Brazilian half our team is Portuguese or Brazilian at this point so that works out pretty well
Fernandao and Emenike are completely different players Fernandao can literally win any aerial challenge be it a long pass from the goalkeeper or scoring from a corner but I don t remember Emenike scoring even one headed goal Emenike likes wide open spaces he can run into but Fernandao is pretty slow on and off the ball he is truly a target man Frankly their only similarity is having a lot of strength but that s about it
fener fans dont know much about football so its expected he considers them similar i wonder if they even watch their own matches at times
and the match that he tried to leave was against Besiktas so I think Bilic saw our agony and wanted to end it
Didn t the two have a bit of a spat
No he had a spat with Emre
Yeah but really who hasn t
True but I think this was his magnum opus because Emre sweared him in Croatian Like he knows Croatian curse words in case he has a spat with a Croat
A professional cunt
Nice I fucking hate Emre
He was linked to us in the summer and we were told he d be too shit so there s that
70 odd goals in 160 games sounds okay to me I trust Bilic for now
My team plays in second tier in Turkish leauge and our both strikers are better than him imo He s more suited to be an athlete probably runner
He s only insurance against our injuries Unless he takes the league by storm we be moving on in the summer The owners have said Batshuayi is our target We re not going to drop 8m on a 30 year old We ll need every penny we have for bigger deals
According to our president if he plays 10 games you have to buy him for 10m
The club ITK ExWHUEmployee who originally reported that Emineke was coming wrote this tonight The deal does not include a final purchase fee despite what is being reported because we couldn t get his agent to agree to it which has meant the deal has dragged on I can also confirm that there is no such deal for us to pay 11m euros for him if he plays 10 games
Just FYI that source he referenced is usually right on everything Very credible source can we say the same for your president
I just looked it up he said if he plays 10 games they will get to buy him for 11m Fuck
Yeah We have no plans on keeping him We just are planning on sending Jelavic to China so we need the cover til Sakho and Carrol get back later this month Sorry but we are splashing the cash big this summer on a striker to pair with the two we have
I heard he apparently underwent some shamanic ritual to alleviate a curse
Looking forward to seeing Paul Merson attempt his name on Saturday
Emmanuel Adebayor Eminem Benteke
let s just go with Steve
Ste will do
As one sweaty beast exits another must enter John 3 17
The lord giveth Emenike and the lord taketh away Ramires
I was thinking Ibarbo instead of Ramires
We got Pato for him so it s all good
love a random african prem proven sucks the surprise out of things could be a sakho could be a savio pull the lever and collect a prize
For every Michael Essiaen there is 10 Ali Dias
I seem to remember some weird story where someone who claimed to be George Weah phoned Southampton to say Dia was the next big thing Which they then used to sign him without even watching 1 game
Yeah his friend from Zuni called Souness saying he was Weah s cousin had played for PSG and had 13 international caps Souness was convinced and signed him to a one month contract After his only match where he was subbed on and then back off Le Tissier famously said He ran around the pitch like Bambi on ice it was very embarrassing to watch He was released after two weeks
Timoth e fucking Atouba
100 Wish we still had alfred ndiaye
This should be interesting
Should be 4th choice
I seriously have no idea what to think of this At the very least he seems to be built like a tank so he could cause problems that way Not heard many good things otherwise but I ll have an open mind until I ve seen him a few times
EMENIKE KSI voice
sadly he may never grace the bpl in fut he is not in this years fut and his loan is only until the end of the season so he will likely be back at al ain in time for next fifa meaning he won t be in fifa 17 either
He wasn t Al Ain s player He was on loan from Fenerbahce
thought it was the other way round my mistake
Mid season transfer cards are a thing
not when he isn t in the game
Thank God for that
Surprising news I didn t realise that we were after him
Who is this guy
some chap who s fast on FIFA
He isnt fast in real life though He is like a shitty drogba gets by on athleticism mostly
as in strength cunt is huge
I see you don t play FIFA
Correct
Basically he s fast Fucking lightning fast
Not to mention fucking ripped as well
He completes the trio of built blockheads Moses Emenike Antonio
Why would a top half prem team buy this mess of a player I do not know
Bit premature to call us a top half team
As a sub more than likely
If he s better than Jelavic i ll consider it a success
Shouldn t be too hard
He s no Mladen Petri but he ll do
Watched him for Nigerian a few times and completely baffled about how he goes about things He seems more intersted in showing his strength than actually playing football I m convinced he thinks a football is a front for a strongman contest Can t finish or pass for shit
BEAST FC
Bollocks does this mean we are in pole position for Yilmaz now
Yilmaz has already passed his best period of his career Declining player imho
Only if you swap Shaquiri Been right cunts about it
I really dont want him lot of money for a 29 year old with no experience outside Turkey
Emenike has experience outside turkey
He spent quite some time in Russia
Yea
Yilmaz
Yilmaz is staying put Was in Gala squad tonight I think He said he isn t moving now but I guess anything can happen on deadline day
Emenike and Doumbia in the Premier League FUT players rejoice
I support Fenerbahce I think Emenike will do well at WHU if they play him Maybe 7 8 goals in the second half
I thought this was r soccercirclejerk when I read the comments
LMAO
YAY So happy for him as a fellow Nigerian Very strong on the ball and can finish Good signing
Absolute gold He really upset you guys didn t he
I m being positive man you should try it out someday
You don t know what we ve been through man I can t be positive about him sorry
That s not optimism that s ignorance or delusion Optimism would be that he might be suit the prem better or that he could do better in this system or would play better playing with and against better players
only positive comment in this whole thread hahah
His problems in Turkey was mostly mental attitude If he changes his attitude he could do well in the Prem this is a good opportunity for him His technique isn t good but his pace and strength could help him
Its as if a hundred thousand FIFA players cried out in pain and were suddenly silenced
Emenike s scoring record over the course of his career 2009 2011 Karab kspor 51 apps 30 goals 2011 2013 Spartak Moscow 42 apps 21 goals 2013 present Fenerbah e 55 apps 16 goals 2015 2016 Al Ain loan 15 apps 9 goals
RIP Fifa Ultimate Team
Doumbia and Eminike in every prem squad
Please As if they d take out Remy
Is this a loan deal or permanent
Loan
I had so many stickers of this guy from the 2014 World Cup sticker book
Football Manager scholar reporting in here He has 19 pace but average technical attributes I m sorry I cannot provide a report from the dimension of reality but apparently knowledge of a video game is just as good
OMG comments on this thread shows the average age of Reddit user on r soccer who fuckin watches teenage twat screaming at FIFA game XD
Remember people he will be behind Sakho Carroll potentially Valencia its a loan deal if he lights it up great no biggy if not our transfer kitty for next season will be the club s biggest by some margin
LOL
Bilic knows what he s doing all that can be said
Quality signing for West Ham been waiting for this one for a while
considering the comments coming from Turkish fans can t be considered a quality signing Think he ll just play as a back up striker
but but muh FIFA 15 stats Surely my opinion that I ve acquired from a video game is worth more than that of the people who have actually seen him play IRL
That was quick
deleted
I d be very surprised if he got 10 goals
He s not a replacement for Enner Valencia He s just an extra striker Our issue is that when Sakho is out we don t have a replacement for him Carroll is too slow and Valencia is too small
What about the Croatian Shearer
I think the terms on the Pringles competition he won to play premier League football expire soon
Wish he can rock at West Ham but want him to not ruin our games at FIFA
He won t be in FUT this year at least
why not
I m pretty sure they don t add players in the January window if they weren t in the game already

Juan Iturbe
Likewise
Saw him play this weekend got outclassed by League 2 defenders before getting subbed off Sounds like you did a good job not getting him
Kondogbia and Jackson Kucka and bacca for 30 million euros less have been far superior
Bertolacci though
Him and cerci are part of the worst 11 in serie a IMO
Bertolacci isn t playing bad He is one of our best passers
Still needs to work his ass more to be more important for you His passes wil be determinant for milan
Wtf Then obviously you don t watch much serie a
United fans should be happy they missed out on Pedro
I think he d actually be better for United He s a really bad fit for Chelsea s system s but I think he d fit United s system really well
He ll be a bad fit everywhere He makes good runs into the box off the ball but thats about what he brings to the table He s wasteful as fuck on the ball
Because wingers bring the ball up for Chelsea and that s what Pedro struggles with
He can t pass or shoot properly either
Christ where do arsenal fans begin Not long ago some fans were calling for Wengers head for missing out on the likes of Christopher Samba
I remember this Absolute shit show
He was an absolute beast for a few years before he disappeared into Russia
Lvg
United will finish above Spurs in the table at the end of the season
alright
They also have the funds to spend 50 mil on a 20 year old striker
Micah Richards
He s been truly abysmal There were a few rumours late last night Sunderland had enquired about him again Garde said it s not happening unfortunately I reckon if you stay up he ll end up at you next year
Yeah I heard that we had bid 10m for him Which is obviously bollocks Really hope we don t sign him
Steven Defour Instead of him we loaned Guardado Which has worked out incredibly well so to say
I know we weren t heavy favorites but as of right now I m glad we didn t sign Depay I still think he can blossom though
Also helps that Douglas Costa turned out better than we all expected I think
Costa turned out to be insane
Same with Darmian for me not quite sure if he s good enough
Darmian is a bit different we didn t get anyone at his position So it s still an ongoing issue but it was far more urgent to have a decent replacement of Robb ry than it is for Lahm so I guess we re OK
Darmian was quality before Alexis destroyed him Causing LVG to lose faith in him He ll get better imo
I was heavily downvoted here in the summer for saying how happy I was the rumours about us signing Pedro for insane money wasn t true Still stand by it
He was linked with Valencia
Not this window but Scott Allan Bet money he scores against us next season though
Scott Allan he s one of our own
TIL Scott Allan is Palestinian
That explains why Nir Biton is keeping him out the midfield
Iturbe Draxler Ranocchia
I would agree apart from Draxler He could have been a great player to help during squad rotations
Draxler has been an incredible disappointment at Wolfsburg He could have done well at Juve except I wouldn t want to pay 35 million for a bench player Having Draxler there also limits the possibilities for the future Berardi becomes a thing of the past Cuadrado would never have came kickstarted our winning ways
Berardi is very nearly a thing of the past already His co ownership was resolved He s owned entirely by Sassuolo now but we retain the right to by him back until the end of 2016
Vermaelon
Depay currently both Coman and Costa have been wonderful
Dani Alves With him Aurier probably would ve never broke out
Aurier is absolutely amazing anytime I ve seen him play Such a great buy for PSG
Falcao for Madrid
That one s a lot more complicated given that if he went somewhere else he may not have gotten injured and been able to keep up his form
Dempsey would ve meant we didn t have Henderson
Juan Cuadrado
Cuadrado has actually been great this season
I ve watched a lot of Juve and I really haven t been that impressed especially for a system like Barca s
I can t speak for Barca but I have been satisfied with him Why did he leave you unimpressed
I haven t been impressed with him in possession I think he makes a lot of rash decisions especially with his shots which are generally awful and unproductive and I don t think he s particularly great with his positioning
He has questionable decision making
He could have been MOTM for the Inter game Forced a penalty and a red card His decision making has been spot on in 2016
That s a rather small sample size considering his decision making was questionable basically every month prior to January of 2016 Edit A word
That comes with any player that you try to incorporate into a new system People tend to forget each manager has different tactics for each position and the role that they want filled on a squad At Fiorentina Cuadrado was given free reign on the right wing However at Juve he s got defensive responsibilities and is expected to deliver crosses into the box as well as take on defenders and test the keeper from distance
But he doesn t cross particularly well he doesn t defend particularly well and his shots are incredibly ineffective He s everywhere that s really about the only positive trait I ve seen in him with Juve which is important in a 3 5 2 but there s a ton of room for improvement
Danilo of course
Honestly I m so thankful that Madrid snatched him up Imagine if we let go of Alves and spent 30m on Danilo We would ve been fucked Sergi Roberto probably wouldn t have gotten playing time and I doubt Vidal would ve been bought either
Ranocchia
M Villa for Arsenal
u sleepnaught He had a bad temper and also had injury problems u Macc14 Don t think he would want to play 3rd choice to Coquelin and El Nenny
WTF happened with his career He was touted as the next coming
I d easily have him over Arteta and Flamini right now
We bid for Depay 18 months ago and also he isn t a player but LVG rejected us for Utd and I m so fucking glad that happened
It is still early days for Depay look at Lamela in his first year in England
Lamela was injured for 9 months in his first year tbf
But he still looked out his depth when he did play Now he looks like a great player Two years make a world of difference in a young player
I d still rather have not bought Depay for 25 million I d rather Son and Chadli right now
It was 20 million by the way not 25 With the bonusses it s gonna be 25
Some reports suggest it could even be 17m We definitely got him for a pretty fair price
He is definilely worth the money long term
Long term so why are you idiots downvoting for saying I wouldn t have him over Chadli and Son right now This sub is an embarrassment
Does that mean you are also a idiot
the price that has been confirmed is 27 5
A few reports emerged after our first CL clash from an agent of the club that it was 17m I don t think the club ever commented on it but it was definitely reported and that was PSV s original quoted price to us and Tottenham Not out of the realm of possibility
The official PSV media manager tweeted that it was 27 5 milion And you also had the bbc saying it was 35 which was just ridiculous its best to just stick to the most reliable sources
he was shite for 2 years and still isn t playing as expected for someone as expensive as he was
Injured for the last 7 months of his 1st season Topped our assists in his second season and has been brilliant this season Not been worth the 30 million but I d definitely rather not have bought Depay for 25 million regardless of Lamela
Depay is still very young and raw hoping he goes on to become great but the jury is still out for sure
Falcao recently
Adriano swap for Drogba back when we had Scolari would have been a disaster
Jesus I forgot about that I think scolari might have actually been murdered
Falcao
Amr Zaki We were gonna sign him 09 10 season but he turned us down because we had two Algerians and an Israeli in the team Plus he s done utter shite since then so fuck him
If we end up w Berahino I will welcome him with open arms whatever that s worth But if we miss out on him I won t be too torn up given his price tag
Balotelli and Falcao last year Those were the most wanted targets among our fanbase
They were never our targets
You guys were linked heavily with balo when he was with us
Just rumours like with Gourcuff We were never interested in either but media always linked them to us Besides since we have a very good and long scouting procedure we rarely identify the wrong player to sign
you ve signed still a plenty of mediocre players
Abel Hernandez He pretty much said he was too good for the Portuguese League and decided to go to Hull instead Promptly flopped got relegated and no one gives a shit about him now Saved a cool 8 or 9m Euros there EDIT Leroy Fer was another We were going for him after we sold Axel Witsel if I remember correctly he declined to come to Portugal and pissed off to play for relegation candidates in England
really Why would you decline Benfica for a relegation candidate in the EPL
Money innit Probably also thought he was too good to play in Portugal
They also priced out Sevilla for Gaston Ramirez PL money is insane
Marega
Rather have Marega than Boats
Rather have none of them but oh well Can t have everything
Mangala
John Stones
he was never for sale
Doesn t mean he can t be glad they didn t sign him Stones has regressed over the last 6 months and Everton would snatch at the chance to get the price that Chelsea were prepared to pay in the Summer only nobody would pay that kind of money for him right now
POGBA Would not fit
Players we at the least enquired for Falcao Pedro I still think Depay is going to become world class
I don t know what people see in Depay Martial doesn t have a great return this season but it s obvious he has bags of talent Depay on the other hand seems as thick as shit on the ball He s just a good athlete with an over rated shot
Pretty much everyone this window
Kaka
Teixeira
Pedro Oh wait cuadrado Oh wait Falcao Oh wait
Jackson Martinez and Kondobiglia or however you spell his name
Bale back when he first started making waves He s a great player but lacks the technique to have been anything more than a buffed up jordi alba in our system
He d break your system but I can t even imagine how monstrous he d be off the ball with the likes of Iniesta and Messi threading it through
That fucking smugness coming off this
Okay a very buff jordi alba
That s better
Alan Shearer Thank God he was fucking dearer
Why wouldn t you want him
I m not saying you re wrong but can you explain this one
He s probably referring to the fact that Man United signed Solskjaer when we weren t able to get a deal for Shearer The rest is history
And every Norwegian thanks you for that Solskj r is a god to a lot of us and was the reason everyone blindly supported United back in the late 90 s early 2000 s

I looked up the record out of curiosity Pele 92 Hat Tricks
It s hard to make a fair comparison though as the majority of Pele s goals were in the Brazillian state championships in which teams vary massively in quality
Also he has hundreds of goals from friendlies that are counted
Exactly There s no point pretending that Pele was anything other than one of the greatest ever but it is strange how others are held to different standards regarding statistics at least
I don t think we would need to pretend that he wasn t the greatest ever I think the gap in quality from then until now would make its case just fine
messi is better
Messi is much closer than Ronaldo and any one else since Madonna for sure It s hard comparison to make though totally different eras Pele not playing in more competitive leagues etc
I was trying to being a material girl No that was obviously a mistake though it amuses me and I m not sure I want to change it
The Brazilian leagues were just as competitive as the European ones at the time Pele played in them Maybe there s some stat inflation by the lower part of some of those leagues but it wasn t like today where the Brazilian league was basically a feeder one for the European leagues
That s probably true of the national leage not sure what it was actually called then but the majority of games Pele played were in the state championships which were of varying quality International football is possibly a better comparison but I think comparing football across eras is a bit pointless anyway
Definitely right about the cross eras thing There s no answer to who was better between Pele and Maradona never mind those guys and the current generation because of the different eras thing but there s no denying Pele was one of if not the best of his generation The guy scored goals for fun whether it was in friendlies national state or international games He destroyed pretty much anyone that was put in front of him
Don t forget those he scored in his garden
if you look at Pele s stat closely his friendlies stats are very similar to his actual game stats both are around 0 98 goal game it is safe to assume that Pele just scored enough goals to win the game like most other strikers rather than cristiano s sick mentality of pushing up his stat by slaughtering weaker opponents
Obligatory
Pay attention kids Thanks u TetraDax
How many in friendlies He played a tons of those
526 goals from friendlies and tour games with the Brazilian army
what a coincidence because I ve scored about 525 with my Sunday league team in friendlies
But could you do it while playing with the Sixth Coast Guard in army tours with complete amateurs
the impressive part is that Pele s goal ratio for friendlies and official matches are pretty much the same around 0 95 goal per match which suggests he probably played the official like friendlies both were too easy for him and he just scored enough to win the match His NT record is 0 84 goal per match as we all know teams are more defensive in worldwide tournament and this is still a super impressive number
Just to clarify I wasn t degrading Pel s goal scoring ability in general let alone with Brazil He s one of the greatest players who have ever touched a football But I just feel like all those goals from army friendlies shouldn t even count in the first place when people say he s the best because he scored 1200 goals
And only one of those hat tricks was during his days at Manchester United I don t know what that speaks more of the drop off of competition in Liga or Ronaldo s scoring ability has gone through the roof since he moved
deleted
Almost 60 now
I don t know if you are joking but he has 33 hat tricks for Barcelona I have no Idea how many he has for Argentina but I highly doubt it s more than 5
Like him or not that is an astounding accomplishment
Ask yourself how many of his hat tricks were complete with one or more penalty
Is he the only player in the world to take penalties It s still an incredible accomplishment what a dumb way to try and discredit it
I ve been going to Charlton since 1985 I saw Jim Melrose hit three against Everton in 1987 The next one was Garry Nelson in 1993 Carl Leaburn astonishingly bagged three in a game a few years after Super Clive hit two hat ticks in 1998 I remember Lisbie bagging three against Liverpool in 2005 maybe I might have missed one or two But at most that s half a dozen across an entire club In 30 years
Still amazes me he only had 1 hat trick for us Wonder what would have been if he stayed and developed in a similiar fashion Need to get into CL so we can have him return a 2nd time at Old Trafford and convince him to move back too
Sir Alex always used to take him off when he was on a brace He d probably have bagged a few for us had that not been the case a lot of the time
on a hattrick
That s the one
The Man U team he played had a different philosophy than today s RM also Ronaldo was a different player and was more focused on team performance rather than individual
I see it the other way around
You see it wrongly
Yeah fuck opinions
No youre wrong and Im right
He also has pretty much the same trophy record as Gary Cahill since his transfer which says a lot about Real really
Maradona only won 6 major club trophies in his entire career 8 total if you include the super cups It s not just about the player how many goals he makes or how gorgeous those goals are It s a team sport How often does the player who wins the Golden Boot also get the trophies that season
maradona won a uefa cup which is today s europa league
Ah my mistake thanks
I don t disagree My point is that Real s dreadful mismanagement of players under Perez has meant they don t have the team achievements to match the phenomenal individual successes I mean this is team that got rid of Makelele because they didn t want to pay him more than a fraction of some of their other players for fuck s sake
That or Real are competing against a far stronger domestic roster
That s very likely true but Real have spent an immense amount of money on players over the last 15 20 years If they d focused more on building a coherent balanced team and less on shirt sales perhaps they d have competed with Barca better
I still insist Ronaldo is your cheapest player
Oh poor Madrid I feel so sorry for you Have you been following football for more than a year What about the 100s of million invested since 2009 A success in commercial terms maybe but little to show for it on the field
I ve been following football all my life We invested money in 2009 to bring Cristiano Benzema etc Some players worked and others didn t How much we invested is meaningless because it brings the club money there s a reason we make so much money
Not sure any team competes with Barca better these last 10 years it s been a freak generation
Your downvotes sicken me I literally cannot comprehend how anyone can disagree with what you ve stated Real are a circus team Team chemistry seems to be a secondary goal behind a circus gathering of insanely good players
A circus team really because we ve had a bad year with a few fuck ups I find that funny coming from a Milan fan What about Barcelona Neymar is being investigated for tax fraud assets frozen in Brazil Messi is going to trial Mascherano admitted being guilty in a tax fraud case Sandro Rosell and Bartomeu have been indicted over Neymar s case Had to give an orgy to sign Neymar etc Bayern and the majority of big clubs have a lot of shit going on too
All teams have a lot of shit going on The point is those teams have still won a lot while your team has wanked over individual statistics Did you see Perez s reaction to Bale getting subbed in that 10 2 A team that plays its best players for 90 minutes against beaten opposition not building the strongest platform for success
We have won a lot too we just haven t constantly won titles this past decade We won the Champions League in 1999 00 2001 02 2013 14 How long is it going to take Chelsea to win three You re talking about a club that has achieved 10 times more than Chelsea and is superior to Chelsea in every single way
That s not what he means by circus mate Not really a good or bad thing either tbh The biggest problem I see with Real Madrid is not the transfer policy but not giving managers their chance to build a team Maybe that will change under Zidane
You got rid of Makelele a player who in part invented the modern holding midfield and signed Beckham That alone should condemn a team And you re talking about one season I m talking about 10 or more of under achievement You ve won 1 more league than Valencia and done absolutely fuck all in the Europe other than 2014
It s because they re a bunch of 14 year old who derive their knowledge of football from Fifa Imagine if someone was to tell them that most of their team s historic success was due to them being propped up by Franco s dictatorship
Or a lot about Chelsea The board and the club have ran practically the most successful team in England during that time frame
That s sort of the point Chelsea have made the most until this season at least of relatively less talented players whereas Real s focus on galaticos has won them not as much
If we had to face against Barca for most our trophies every year we wouldnt have been as successful
Chelsea have done as well if not better in the Europe over the same period of time I think if Madrid had as balance a team as Chelsea over that period they might have done better Also who s we Are you Josh McEachran
Well if Chelsea had been playing against arguably the best team of all time then I m sure you guys wouldn t have won any league titles Barcelona have been just a little bit better every time last season we were just two points off We have been more consistent than Chelsea in the Champions League and in the league We haven t dropped to 15th or been eliminated by a 10 man PSG have we We have a balanced squad we re just not playing a balanced starting XI
By what measure have Madrid been more consistent than Chelsea in the Champions league in this time period Both won it once each Chelsea in the latter stages more before 2012 vice versa after Pretty equal Also did you not notice the until this season part Chelsea have been utter shite this season and no one s pretending otherwise
I didn t say we d done better only that that both had consistently achieved similar finishes The only seasons where Madrid finished a lot higher was 2013 given that when each team won it the other finished in the semi final Madrid edge it but they ve also had a far more talented side than Chelsea for the most part
Oh they have numerous failed big signings I m referring to players like the aforementioned Cahill Ramires Mikel Malouda ect Excellent players in their own way but not Madrid Barcelona Bayern signings
Yeah but most big clubs move towards big signings We had a great youth set up and the golden generation was our backbone to winning more so that signings in the last decade Signings were used to sustain that Chelsea have won 4 league titles since 2000 Madrid have won 5 Chelsea have won 1 champions league since 2000 Madrid have won 2 So I disagree with your statement that the galacticos has not won Madrid as much as Chelsea Also market value global reach and profile wise the Galacticos has really really helped Madrid
If you see my original comment I was referring to the period since Ronaldo signed what we might term the second galatico era In that era Atletico have achieved the same as Real domestically My point is that for all Ronaldo s incredible records it hasn t translated into a great deal of success which I blame in large part on mismanagement and instability at Real
I m not actually saying that Chelsea is a better run club than Madrid They ve had a revolving door policy on managers for years and years and the transfer policy is a joke on which I d rather not get started What I m saying is they ve had a more stable and balanced squad and first XI a lot of the time think Cech Terry Cole Lampard Drogba while some managers have been given the authority to shape the team as they see fit If Madrid had this plus great managerial stability the ought to have won more
Yeah but come on as every one else said you cannot discount the fact that they are up against this barcelona side That s a huge factor I m sure no other club in the world would have won more than Madrid have in the same league as Barcelona and so I m not sure you should discount that Ronaldo is the centerpiece of all Madrid have achieved The year that Atleti won the league was the year they won a champions league which is by no means a bad end
Still stingy about the extra time goal
I really don t understand why many Chelsea fans constantly bring up the goal whilst failing to mention the amazing Ramires goal before it i e the goal that actually decided the tie
Because he talked about Torres
I didn t really mean here In general I see it mentioned a lot more than the Ramires goal Don t get me wrong that Torres goal was a brilliant moment but it didn t mean as much in the grand scheme of thing
that goal didn t really matter though did it you were winning at the time
It definitely did matter we were a man down with our other CB off injured facing attack after attack from Barca that final goal allowed us to breathe and killed off the game
i d say it says more about barca tbh
I wouldn t deny the brilliance of Barcelona But Real have achieved as much against them as Atletico in the same period despite investing so much more in the team That is my point
Legend
That s like 39 match balls
38 Madrid hatricks in 6 and a half years Fucking insanely stupid stat
Ask yourself how many of his hat tricks were complete with one or more penalty
Alien
That s absurd
But how many against big teams
DareToDownvote
Too bad he cant win anything
Yeah but can he do it on a warm dry night in Madr oh
All those goals and only 1 cl and 1 league during his time at madrid in the most expensive squad of all time Let that sink in should give you an idea of the types of teams the majority of these hat trick have been scored against
Helps Madrid end a 12 year drought in the Champions League by being their top scorer in the competition and requesting to play in the final even though he was injured and unfit All these goals and he only won the two most important titles against arguably the best Barcelona of all time hurr durr Do you enjoy being the bottom comment in all Ronaldo threads today or are you just baiting Poor effort either way
Pffff look at you being logical and shit
At least he s a fair point something that can t be said the same about you
Wow so you think with the amount of money real has spent on their squad 1 league and 1 cl in 7 years is a good return on investment Again top scorer in CL doesn t mean anything to me if he is scoring 5 against malmo and 4 against shaktar in the group stage with multiple goals coming from penalties
He currently holds the record for most goals ever in the CL
Sure but it s just a matter of time before Messi surpass him
Sure he should ve missed on purpose
I misread and thought you re talking about his CL goals from 2013 14 season But as I said it doesn t really matter because Messi will be No 1 anyway
Penalties and tap ins don t count
Neither does your opinion
You d think with the flair I have people would catch sarcasm
which led to only 1 cl final with madrid which he performed poorly in despite being in the most expensive squad of all time
I don t understand how anyone even takes this argument seriously You realise that of he has the most CL goals of all time and still only won 1 CL with Real then it implies that his other teammates are at fault Ronaldo isn t a defender If he s scoring that many and Real are still failing then the problem is elsewhere
Cristiano has the most CL goals of all time sure but Messi will eventually become the new leader as the latter is younger than the Portuguese I don t really think it s the teammates fault why Real Madrid doesn t win titles and it s down to Cristiano They ve a lot of talent that is wasted by trying to get Cristiano to score goals If anything the team will be better when he leaves And as a anti Madridista I m very afraid when that happened
Except thats not true I remember even in one of the recent CL games against PSG his teammates set him up with several good chances and he didn t convert just to give one example I don t know what it is maybe the pressure gets to him in the big games
He was injured
Poor excuse why playing in the first place then
Ask Perez because at this point I m sure not all the decisions when it comes to Real matches are taken by the manager It reminds me of years ago when Messi was played against Bayern despite clearly being unfit I don t think I ve ever seen him play as badly as he did that day
i m pretty sure 5 of those are against sevilla because he has achieved the odd feat of scoring at least one hat trick against them every season since 2010 11 he still has a shot at making it 6 seasons in a row in about a month
and 2 copa del rey 1 supercup 1 uefa super cup 1 club world cup and whole bunch of individual honors still an amazing featGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
That s a no brainer for West Brom
BBC Sport reporter saying that they ve reiterated he s not for sale Lol
I m actually hoping he stands by that haha He might be a good signing but 21m is a mental amount to risk
Rumor has it he s not selling because he thinks he s worth more but because he doesn t want to give Pulis spending money
Even when you re heading down
It s embarassing how much some of our fans care about how much we spend The club are finally willing to invest decent money into premier league players and we have people crying that we are now spending too much as if it s coming out of their pocket We are on course to get relegated the only concern should be whether the player improve us or not and Berahino clearly would
well its probably because the money isnt infinite money spent on Berahino is money that could be used better elsewhere e g on a defender
And 21m isn t all the money that we have Loads moaned when we bought Shelvey and Townsend as well A defender isn t going to keep us up a CM and a goal scorer gives us a very good chance
bad defense is a complex problem and im not saying you shouldn t address it or anything but in the middle of the season i think it s easier to get an impact player that can score and especially if you lose four games in a row 1 0 one could argue that with a goal scored you would ve taken a point as well
Maybe some of your fans are worried about debt You know blowing 20mil on mutliple flops with big contracts could end up crushing your club for the next 50 years that sort of thing
good point
In fairness we kind of can t afford to sell him as he s the only one who can score goals and isn t injured If Morrison were fit and it was earlier in the window though then if we d come out with that statement I d have hung myself
But he s not playing He hasn t started a game since October so I m not sure how he can be that vital to you
He started yesterday and scored twice He s also played 18 games this season in the league albeit 10 off the bench is our top scorer in the league and cup and Morrison is injured resulting in no creativity in the squad and Saido is renown for scoring from absolutely nothing
He s not started in the league since October The fact he s your best goalscorer and is still stuck on the bench not being used is even more reason to sell him and get someone Pulis actually will use
He s not started in the league as we had Morrison so didn t need him he wasn t fit for the past 2 league games so didn t start them Morrison is out for another 6 weeks so we kind of need him now
To me it sounds like you don t need Morrison If he is coming off the bench and scoring more goals than your 1st team choice maybe your 1st team choice is wrong I d be starting him ahead of Morrison Then again 21m is stupid money and you should snap their arm off
Morrison is a midfielder and is our joint top scorer in the league Also the reason we re still in the FA Cup
Pulis would take the money and run if it were up to him This will 100 be rejected because of Peace who will have a number in mind and refuse anything below that even if it means losing him for less in the future Pulis was annoyed not to have got rid in the summer He ll be even more annoyed come Tuesday if Berahino is still here
Ravel Morrison

You re beautiful
That s James Blunt isn t it
No Chris Blunt

Depends how its structured really it won t be 21m flat I imagine the club also have doubts over selling someone to a significant rival for relegation Berahino is good enough to keep a club up almost alone if his heads right Not sure Berahino will be too keen either given there s talk of another Spurs bid
Is there a reason for that Seems pretty unusual Big money deals without any kind of incentives structure is incredibly rare Still I can t see it being rejected if thats the case though that may well be one more team to count out the relegation race EDIT Actually it seems like it will be rejected Incredible
The reason being clubs would rather have cash in hand to go and spend elsewhere than have part of the fee locked up behind incentives and bonuses
Straight up apparently TAKE IT AND RUN PEACE
Sky sports have said it is straight up full amount
iirc Newcastle have always paid in full on purchase orders from Ashley
Sure but I can t help but feel Berahino himself can do better
Like what Tottenham you cheeky basterd
Yeah although I don t think Levy will pay that much for him
you offered 22 m pounds in the summer you silly man
Yeah but I don t see him offering this again right now Berahino isn t even in the first team for them and his contract is running out
His value has decreased since then
Without a shadow of a doubt West Brom don t need Berahino or his goals Peace would be crazy to reject such an insane price
He s their top scorer this season in both the league and cup so they might very well need his goals
He s scored thrice in the league One was a 1 yard tap in and another was a deflected shot he knew nothing about The club absolutely do not need him He won t be missed one single bit
Newcastles January window not sure if Mike Ashley or Perez
Why would Ayoze be bidding for us
More sensible than Joe Kinnear
I m imagining Kinnear trying to pronounce Ayoze now
Jazzy Pez Dispenser
Alonso Poached Egg
Kebab Perez
I feel like paying so much for players must put Mike Ashley in physical pain
They have spent like 90 million pounds so far The spending power of a club contending for the Champions League and they re fighting relegation
What I can see they have spent 29m in january
Spent 50m in the summer and if this goes through it will be 100m for the season Not even that big a dent in our finances either We ve made 100m profit over the last 5 seasons on it s own from transfers and with big TV deal coming in we re laughing if we stay up
One can only imagine what those 90 millions could have done if invested in the squad after we finished 5th
TAKE IT AND RUN JEREMY YOU TWAT
Egghead ay sure thinks he can get another 2 million
Is he holding a Nokia 8800
Looks like a 6300 Great phone
Maybe
Looks like a 6300 to me
Please do
Lmao that picture they used of Berahino scoring against Newcastle
There s never a shortage of stock photos of players scoring against us There must be a 1000 in the Coloccini looking on despondently as the ball once again nestles in the net folder
you re not a native english person but chose Bristol City why do you put yourself through this pain
masochism is my middle name
You don t know nestles but you know and can apply masochism in a sentence Interesting
well i had some trouble finding that term https i imgur com XQpmwgk png
you had me at sodomy
i forgot the word
Maybe he moved to Bristol
long story short basically went on a trip through the UK and I ended up without any money left in Bristol was 19 at the time I met some people students that let me stay at their place for some money and they lived very close to the stadium so i tried to get a job there and I did get a job for a month and a half I went to some games and had the time of my life until i got back to the netherlands and i have been following the club since
Always good to hear good things about Bristol on r soccer it s a really underrated city in England
expensive as fuck though
oh okay still confuses me in a football context though like the ball enjoy sbieng in the net
In the context of football it s pretty much a way of saying that a team scored like when the ball hits the net and then settles down in the goal
Yes it s a verb I guess you could say it comes from animals making a nest probably It basically means to come to rest in a comfortable spot
right allright that explains nestles logo fuck im stupid
You certainly aren t stupid I don t know what language you speak but I can at least assume you speak 2 languages at a very good standard and that s to be admired
yes it explains their logo im retarded https s media cache ak0 pinimg com originals 3b 3b 74 3b3b74f4e74e9fcc0c39aa910a0a86d8 jpg
Surely that s a bit much
As everyone has said in every single PL transfer thread It s a inflated January market we need to adjust our expectations I m calling it the Lewis Grabban effect whatever you think they re worth add 5 7m
So my mate Jeff is worth 5 7 million quid Amazing Should let him know really he needs to stop playing five a side in case he gets injured
Cheeky cunt F x 1 x 5 6 7 if x 0 happy now
So what you re now saying is that given you re adding 5 7 to a player s value in fact everyone s value goes down by 2 million
its a range of 5 to 7 so change it to 5 6 7
Yeah I see your sneaky edit bro Despicable My mate Jeff will be crushed
Fuck Jeff anyway he always asks you to cover him on a pint and never returns the favor
You actually have no idea how close to the truth that is
Mate we all have a friend like that Reddit is just a portal to other universes and we are all each other in mirrored lives I am you and you are me

If I were Berahino I would have difficulties making this decision His situation at West Brom is not fine but joining a team in the relegation battle is a huge risk to take
Newcastle would let him leave if a big club came in for him in the future I imagine his agent will look for a relegation release clause or something No brainer for him
Charlie Austin would have wanted that agent
Why Charlie Austin rejected plenty of Lower PL club offers he was happy getting paid a lot at QPR before moving for free in the summer and having his pick of clubs As it turned out Saints popped up and cut that short but no one ever reported Austin was upset to be staying at QPR in September
Pretty sure rumour has it that we put a bid in that was rejected by Austin
All the North East journo s said that no one had a bid accepted and Newcastle were prepared to offer the most This was about a week before the deadline
Yes he did He personally rejected Palace
Source No one had a bid accepted in the summer Newcastle bid the highest at 12m an no one else who go above 10m
Also and I know some might scoff Berahino must have Euro 2016 in the back of his mind As with Charlie Austin if he hits 15 goals between now and then he ll be in contention
A big club came in for him in the summer though and he wanted the move In 6 months he s gone from within a hairs breadth of joining a top 6 side looking set to finish in the top four to potentially joining a side scrapping to escape relegation Pretty shit situation for him to be fair
Bang in a 13 3m relegation clause score several goals get relegated Tottenham pay clause for his dream move
He really hates the owner so I m sure he wants to leave
what about Spurs Didn t they also make offers
Weren t accepted IIRC
Don t think they ve made a bid for him this window
What in the fuck is going on absolute mad window
I love how you are throwing the kitchen sink at trying to survive and we re just sitting over here chilling not spending even enough to buy a ham sandwich
We ll give you Gouffran for nowt if you want that might help you a bit
Shhh I think I know how this works Gouffran is an amazing winger 10 10 really has something specials 25mil please
Berahino tricked Ashley into spending the money yesterday haha I do like Berahino though
Cashl y
a h
I told Ashley to spend money during the transfer window and he actually did it haha the madman
If Jeremy Peace doesn t accept that then he must be mental insane amount of money
It s an NUFC club record Owen was 17 5m in 2005 and Shearer was 15m in 1995
I m all for it if it goes towards erasing even the smallest amount of Michael Owen from our history books
If Newcastle pay 21m for Berahino they will have spent more on him than they did on me Michael Owen
Really like splurging on strikers don t you In hindsight Shearer was a bargain
I mean Shearer was kind of worth it considering he went on to be club and league record top scorer but then again Michael Owen
In hindsight it was an absolute bargain though at the time he was an aging striker with a potentially dodgy knee so it was a bit barmy despite his goals record Owen was the stupidest transfer ever
Shearer was only 26 when he transferred to Newcastle
Aging not old
Everyone is aging
How much did the FA Fifa paid to Newcastle for the injury in 2006
Around 8m 10m We used the money the sign Obafemi Martins
Adjusting for British transfer inflation the 15 million Shearer was purchased for would be about 67 million today That s a lot to spend and not win a single trophy I used Tompkins model for Premier League inflation
Shearer was not a bargain Great transfer Yes Bargain no way The price was so insane people didn t believe the tabloid headlines when the news broke With your sort of logic Andy Cole moving to Manchester United a few months earlier for less than half the fee was a bargain too
We ve gone from the stingiest bastards around refusing to replace class players who we sold to become back ups at better clubs than ours and now we ve started paying over the odds for players who ve seemingly had a falling out at their clubs Not sure which way I prefer but if it helps us stay up I couldn t give a fuck
In fairness he will score the goals to keep you up if you get him
Based on the 6 months he was good like a year and a half ago
He s our top scorer and has been in and out the team He scores goals he would most likely score the goals to keep you up
The money being thrown about at barely above average English players is astonishing
Shelvey Townsend and now Berahino Newcastle are mental
This just looks like Steve McLaren making a Steve McLaren team The parts probably aren t worth their individual fee s but putting them in a team will make them worth what they ve paid
Shelvey won us three points on his own a couple of weeks ago if those three points keep us up with that sweet sweet TV money we d have underpaid for him
tbf a 20 21 year old scoring 20 goals in one season for an uncreative team like WBA is pretty good
He isn t barely above average though If he was foreign you wouldn t have a problem with his transfer fee
Barely above average is definitely selling him short but he s no way worth 20mill whether he s English or foreign Saw on Twitter they apparently want 24m for him You must admit that is pretty ridiculous
If 10m is acceptable for borini 22m for berahino is daylight robbery
It s not ridiculous considering the money at stake for both clubs if they re relegated
A fair point Just obscene that someone deems a player of his level to be worth that much Sign of the times I guess but it s absolute madness Sometimes think I m stuck valuing players the same way they would have been 3 5 years ago
He s good but 21m good I question that When Austin went for 4m and whose asking price at most previously was 15m I d question the value of this transfer
And think actually aren t against these signings and look at you like that s something which should be the norm These fees are more inflated than the ones in early 00s Serie A were
Deadline day is right around the corner and it s gonna be a treat
If Newcastle pick Berahino ahead of Doumbia an accomnplished goal scorer even in European competition who costs literally half the price then they are mad Berahino is talented but come on him and West Brom have broken up their relationship long time ago and you would think they would actually be able to get the fee down to a decent price instead of starting to bid with an already mad fee
We want two strikers apparently out of a combination of Berahino Doumbia Remy and Gomis Riverie looks set to join Lille apparently
They won t get the price down if anything Peace will be wanting it to go up
We ve basically already signed Doumbia but we want Berahino too apparently If we don t get Berahino we were rumoured to be after Gomis but apparently Swansea have blocked the move
Berahino was one of the top scorers in the league last year and he s young Seydou Doumbia is old and only proven himself in Russia which is of far worse quality than the epl He moved to Roma and looked terrible Buying Doumbia would be a mistake
Doumbia is proven at a champions league level
I was hoping we d go in for him We desperately need a striker but if we do sign Imbula that s gonna be a lot of our budget
Everyone is spending loads of money this window except us
Honestly is there any point for you guys though you wont make up the points to survive and there is no point investing on prem quality players because none will come without relegation release clauses if they re smart Better to regroup and prepare for the championship
If he were to go there he would be an even bigger twat than I thought he was At least wanting Spurs or Liverpool is the step up This is shite
Another player with attitude problems he ll fit right in
It ll be like Dyer and Bowyer all over again
Mitrovic and Berahino kicking off on the final day as they go down can see it
Ah whey at least our players are bothered about getting relegated your lot don t look it Obsession the new fragrance from Sunderland AFC
BANTER
How does this make any sense Can they spend all this money without getting into problem with the FFP
The club is loaded they just have no intentions of anything other than staying in the league
Newcastle s is technically one of the best run clubs in the country they make massive profits it s just never been fully reinvested Fairly sure they dont have much debt either so they can spend loads
We have debt it s just owed to Ashley
I think we ve made profits for like 5 years in a row
They re the 17th richest football club in the world They ve just been acting like they re the 17 000th
Take the money and run
As a Baggies fan 21 million is an absolute farce in terms of his ability and attitude So yes sell up Wouldn t care to see the back of him given we can invest in some dedicated hungry talent
No way is he even worth 15 million how the heck is he worth 21 million Anyway it s not my money so do what you want to do Mr Ashley
Newcastle s defence needs strengthening more than their attack Mitrovic hasn t done anything really but they re one injury away from having to play Taylor or Lascelles
we all know we need a LB some want that a CB but just a LB would be great
If we get a LB though then we might be able to use Dummett as cover for CB but that depends on if the coaching staff believe he can play there
Misallocation of resources IMO Coloccini is dodgy as well and aging
Colo has been one of our best performers in the last few months having said that he blows hot and cold but he does seem to have found a decent partnership with Mbemba You re right about the ageing though he might have one more full season left in him but we will 100 need to sign at least one new CB in the summer along with a new LB and more cover
Supposedly the logic was all the CBs we were after that were better than Colo were too expensive Every CB signed this summer seemed really expensive and extending Colo was better than being ripped off
There have been about 10 games this season where if we had someone who could take chances it wouldn t have mattered that we let one or two goals in that s presumably the logic why they re going after a striker
Talk of Lucas Orban from Valencia to play left back and then to convert Dummett to an out and out centre back I m not a fan of Dummett but he has been much better when ever he has played in the centre
Wouldn t be surprised if this was rejected as well tbh It s a good offer don t get me wrong but we kinda need Berahino right now with our injuries and thin squad not to mention Rondon hasn t quite settled yet and Lambert can t hit a barn door He s our only natural goalscorer Not to mention Peace is apparently holding out for at least 25m and doesn t want to sell to anyone below us but who could overtake us in the table I think he might just keep Berahino until his contract expires and get whatever we can from the tribunal If we were to sell we d need replacements lined up ASAP Matt Phillips and Diego Rolan have been linked for ages EDIT also remember just a few days ago when people were saying we d be lucky to get 10m for him lol
Looks like you re right mate
Don t know why nobody seems to rate this guy He is quality if he was at United or Liverpool everyone would talk about how he is the future of the England team
pls reject pls reject pls reject
Surely he s coming now right Not sure whether to be happy or sad
Tad overpriced but can t see WBA passing up such an offer Newcastle going hard this window
Lol Funny thing is after yesterday I don t think we can let him go unless we can 100 bring in someone who can score goals like he can I don t think Peace would sell but I d fucking take that
Saido will find a way to kill him if he doesn t go along with the deal
What a time to be alive lads lasses
What the fuck
And they are about to sign Doumbia right Looks like they will have some freaking pacey strikers

Totti and Lahm are the last of the Mohicans
De Rossi
Tru
Why Lahm he got his big break with his loan to Stuttgart and made a name for himself there
He was still owned and grew up in Bayern s youth
Iniesta and Messi aren t Edit So I m downvoted just would like to know why Either I didn t understand the reference to Totti Lahm and Terry or I wonder what s the difference between Lahm and Iniesta Same age in their club since 12 y old The difference I can see digging more is Iniesta isn t born in Barcelona contrary to the other three Does that warrant being downvoted without answers I don t know
Edit You ve risen like the phoenix
You right
Messi was born in Barcelona
So was totti n terry apparently
Quite remarkable since Hiddink officially recommended giving him a new contract He said Terry was still fit enough to have an impact he was also important on creating a positive competitive atmosphere Besides a new long term manager could still have plans for him
He played every single Chelsea game last season and he was fucking incredible This makes no sense Why would you not beg your best player who has so many fans to stick around
Club treats legends like shit it s nothing new considering how lamps went and Drogba did first time round
I agree about this being a shitty way to have him leave but why did Drogba leave in a bad way I thought it was perfect
I also agree he left on perfect terms but that was more lucky circumstance him carrying us in the final and us winning the league with him but I m pretty sure we made no effort to keep him on both times Surely that champions league final game was enough to suggest another year or 2 on his contract
Well they sure did right by Cech
Not a big fan of Terry for a few reasons but his experience and mentality would be invaluable at the club Reckon he deserves more The young fellas at the clubs could learn so much from him
Chelsea is pissing me off this season
That s how I feel most of the seasons
This is a fucking disgrace We don t do testimonials and we re letting our talisman leave the club AND WE RESIGN IVANOVIC
What do you mean surely chelsea will have a testimonial for Terry
they should invite bridge for the laugh
He can captain the opposition Bring Anton Ferdinand in too
And Big Ron to manage Terry s side
The club has a no testimonial policy it was mentioned in another thread god knows why
I think the club would make a huge connection with its fans if it decided to start one right now Have one for Lamps and Terry It would really mean something to Chelsea supporters I reckon
That would be quite a fun charity match to have team Lampard vs team Terry
Because Chelsea only started in 2005 so players have only just been there long enough for them to even think about testimonials obviously s
Cough Plastic cough
I can t remember the last time we did one Lamps Didier and Cech didn t get them so I doubt it
But testimonials don t always happen right away do they I seem to recall quite a few players getting a testimonial after they retire completely rather than just leaving a particular club It might be a bit weird Cech having a testimonial with him at Arsenal now
It s usually 10 years at a club or retirement I think Theo is getting his for Arsenal
Oh I get the 10 year concept it s just I figured that the timing of the testimonial might be an issue So a player does 10 years at a club moves to another club retires a bit later Then they do the testimonial at his main club It would have to fit into the schedule of the club and the various players etc
Would be an even bigger disgrace if we let both Brana and Terry go in the same window Its bad enough we re getting rid of one leader Why would we get rid of both
But Terry has been playing better than Iva and he s clearly had a huge influence on Zouma and we just bought Miazga another young cb Why get rid of him instead of phasing him out in preparation for his retirement in a few years
The lessons he d impart on Zouma would be priceless Worth having him in the squad just for the experience he d bring to all the young lads
He s been working alongside Zouma for 3 years now If Zouma hasn t learned enough by now then he s a lost cause But fortunately enough its clear he has in fact left his mark and it shows in just how rock solid Zouma has been Add in the fact that Cahill and Ivanovic both share loads of experience and Mikel being the most senior player on our team with the composure and swagger of a truly world class player I don t really see any incentive to keep Terry for that very reason Sure I d love for Terry to stay and retire here but the next generation will learn a lot just from this current squad alone
Letting Ivanovic go for nothing in the summer would be monumentally stupid
Isn t it more likely Terry has indicated that he wants to leave
Not according to this https twitter com danlevene status 693880259209469952
That is very odd
I m fuming as are most Chelsea fans Complete disrespect to a club legend Pathetic by the club
Terry is the last of the allegedly problematic old guard If he s not good enough to start why would you take that risk Especially after Mou was forced out due to player power I d expect the club to sign a monster CB to replace him
Jesus this is disgraceful from Chelsea Legends can be phased out in a respectful way maintaining both party s dignity and keeping their strong influence Look at Giggs or Scholes for example
As long as you don t believe that player carries too much power Fergie kept Giggs and Scholes around because they were good soldiers and supported him Will Terry back the next manager especially if he s relegated to a limited role I can t see it
Terry would be the first person to speak up if he felt like he wasn t good enough to play anymore
Maybe but it s possible he might have wanted a new challenge or a change of scene
This is Mr Chelsea we re talking about
He s been at the club for ages though It s not unheard of for a player to want to change late on in his career Anyway it seems from his statement that he didn t want to leave but has been forced to
Moving in a different direction Yeah mediocrity Fucking hell give him a new contract
Has JT ever complained about being on bench when he was early this season I am sure he would like to play and I d understand if JT reject the contract because club explicitly told him that you are a back up player But what I dont understand it the club not even offering the contract I mean we clearly showed lack of leadership with Lamps Drogba Cech gone Even if we dont play JT he could still be around to influnece like Drogba did for our 14 15 campaign Absolutely disgraceful behavior towards quite arguably the most Chelsea loving legend
I mean with Cahill and zouma and the new American it makes sense
Christensen is more likely to be a regular next season than Miazga Point is though that even if Terry doesn t play he s influential behind the scenes and loved by the fans It s hard to see why they would let him go
I d still like to see JT stay and teach Stones a thing or two
deleted
Er what
John Tsones
JS
I oddly thought the same exact thing at first
Sorry guys brainfart I was up for 26 hours and failed my fucking test in the last 2 minutes today
Oh I didn t know his loan was two seasons Makes sense but I d have liked him back next season I guess we ll probably see a new transfer in summer then
I don t think it can be understated how much leadership is lost by getting rid of Terry Lampard Cech and Drogba in four straight seasons I understand that none of them maybe except for Cech would be worth their wages on the pitch but a season is long and exhausting both physically and mentally and the experience of those four will most likely be greatly missed
Cahill will have to seriously seize this opportunity and step up as Chelsea s new defensive leader
Thought he wanted to leave as well
He doesn t want to leave He wants to start at the EURO s and that s not going to happen if he doesn t play
No way he starts Jags and Smalling or Stones should be starting
Stones The guy isn t in form now It should be Jagielka and Smalling
Euros is still like 4 months away I m sure Stones will regain his for by then
So like I said Jags and Smalling or Stones and Smalling
We ll most likely sign a new centerback next year who ll start with Zouma So the only way to keep cahill happy is if he is given Terry s minutes as the next in line There were reports few days ago about Cahill was unhappy I can t see us keeping both Cahill and Terry happy if we sign a new starting quality centerback
Pretty sure Terry is being let go to make room for Stones Cahill will be back up next season
Even if that is the case this is still the stupidest decision theyve made even for this trainwreck of a season FFS we are going to have a 21 year old replace the spine of our defence with no transition at all John Terry arguably the greatest defender of the Premier League era Chelsea legend and he gets fuck all respect
Don t you see they re going to bring stones in and give him Terrys number that way he can mentor him by text so we don t actually need him to stay
The pressure on Stones would be even more insane if that s the case Not only would he have to cope with the ridiculous fee Chelsea will have to pay if they want him but also directly replace a club legend Don t see it going very well honestly
Bit rediculous how Chelsea won t let him decide when to retire he s one of the few one team players left and it must be heartbreaking for him to hear We ve decided after all your years of being with this club all your hard work we ve decided to tell you that you a critical first team player last year will not have your contract renewed Go away at the end of the season I guess Chelsea has been holding a grudge against him since the penalty
The man deserves a statue in front of the Bridge he should be able to stay as long as he wants
Can this be the statue
Absolutely a crucial first team player this year as well His performance was shoddy at the start but whose wasn t for us He has bounced back just as much as everyone else in the club
Im sure he sat down with them and part of it was his decision
I m sure they did but I m still disappointed John Terry s Chelsea days are numbered

Welcome to LA Galaxy John Terry
This is a fucking embarrassment No one encapsulates Chelsea more than our Captain and no one more deserves to end his career there more than JT
Terry to LA Galaxy confirmed
They have zero salary space left
Bit silly that the article makes out he hasn t won the Champions League just because he was suspended from the final Players have kicked a water bottle on the sideline and still had a Champions League win go down on their record Just a little niggle I had with the normally fantastic Guardian articles
He hasn t You have to play in the final to win it I m not sure if the bench even count as winning it unless they are subbed on
Finally he can make that dream move to West Yorkshire he missed out on 15 years ago
The board are trying to make it real hard to stay a Chelsea fan How can I support a club if I hate the higher ups and they get rid of an absolute legend through a phone call Fuck
Why because I feel a disconnect with the club Sometimes it s tough being a fan when it s run by a board like this one
Absolute Plastic Actually I am going to tag you as Chelsea Fan 2015 2016
So were the fans that went and made FCUM plastic No Same dissilusionment with the repulsive board and the business decisions they make
Thats different we were a club that wasn t owned and very successful alot of fans left and made FCUM cause of the stupid amount of debt the glazers put on the club which cause a lot of strain on the prices of tickets for fans etc of the club this is list a player leaving who is old and your saying your going to jump ship
He s saying that the board of United didn t make the club but rather using it to their advantage i e paying their own debts While with Chelsea it s entirely because of the board and the asshat owner that they got the position they re in today It s kinda ironic to say you will stop being a fan because of their decisions
Thank You unfortunately clubs have terrible boards stop supporting a club because of it is ridiculous Chelsea downvote brigade
Do whatever you want If the board ditches our legends without an ounce of respect ditches our most successful coach ever because of a bad run I have every right to be upset At the end of the day I don t live in London so if I can t get behind the players coach or board it s difficult to support them Call me what you want ps saying it s hard to support a team doesn t mean I m ditching them
The way you speak is just repulsive
This doesn t make any sense They ve already decided not to renew him even before bothering to negotiate Surely there is some price at which he would be worth it for another year Maybe they wouldn t come to an agreement but you never know if you don t try Bunch of crazy idiots on that board I guess
Going to US for his last paycheck
He ll do just as poorly as Gerrard or Lampard have done
Terry is on another level compared to those guys at this point of time
If they don t buy Stones chelsea are in big trouble Actually even if they buy Stones The guy needs at least another season before going to a bigger team
Leadership and experience has become incredibly undervalued
That s why it doesn t make sense A year under Terry would help Stones so much
Absolutely fucking furious What the fuck Just can t believe it
Ramires leaving was pretty saddening but this is on a whole other scale Absolutely unbelievable
Man JT sounds bitter and using the media to make his feelings knows Sure Chelsea are going to enjoy being manipulated Grabbing the popcorn this is going to be fun to watch
Would this be a decision that guus hiddink made or the chelsea board
Board Chelsea make no secrets about their contract policies for players over 30
That s even worse
Calling it now Chelsea will buy Varane
I could only see that happen if they still had Mou
Hahahahaha

At the time of the draw I honestly did not think we had much of a chance against Bayern Now I think we ll give them a serious run for their money
Score an early goal and try not to panic at the Allianz Boateng is injured so Pep probably won t play as high a line with Martinez and Badstuber Bayern is the polar opposite of Juve when it comes to attack almost everything comes from the wings Don t sell yourselves short you got into the final last year Edit Just scrolled down Martinez is also injured We re gonna get Porto d
Alaba probably won t be in midfield the players who have that position are thankfully still fit We ll probably utilize Kimmich or Rode as both of them can play a defensive midfield role If there is any silver lining its that
Yeah injuries giving playing time to underused players is the only upside of all of this A more varied distribution would be nice not just wingers last year and defender right now
Did u just give someone directions on how to beat ur team Guys I found the Bayern Munich mole
Told em to score more goals than the opposition and to not concede Totally caught me red handed selling Bayerns secret recipe
michael owen agrees
Paging Guidolin Pls follow bayerns secret recipe game plan
Could be wrong but I also don t think the guy you said that to is Allegri
Allegri is probably some guy here with one of those meat commission flairs
You told it to someone on reddit aswell definitely going to lose the game now
To be fair Alaba and Badstuber are pretty good themselves Whatever happened to Benatia though He was excellent with Roma
What about Benatia
Injured again but he should be back against Juventus
Oh for fucks sake here we go again
Oh man I wish you could make that happen But I m pretty pessimistic that you can succeed against them in the Allianz Arena
I ve said from the beginning I think Juve s got the best chance of any 2 seed to win their tie They re a really good team The only major issue I see for them is their dependence upon the 3 5 2 I think that ll struggle a lot a lot against Costa Robben and Bayern s fullbacks Without any wide attackers Lahm Alaba won t have any reason to stay back and will really be able to help stretch the defense
I think PSG has got the better chance
I hope you guys knock them out
That Pogba touch at the end to hit the post was insane
absolutely incredible player cant wait for him to develop a little more and start challenging for the ballon d or runner up spot

Kudos to Chievo for taking more shots than Inter and Roma
Haha
Tometek takes more shots than Inter
at least we conceded less
You came closer than them to a draw but you were still nowhere near a win
All the talk about Juve starting like shit and they re still going to win the Serie A for a 5th year Lol
Napoli is still ahead if they win against Empoli And Napoli are brilliant I can t see them losing or even drawing many matches
From what I ve seen from Juve these past weeks I don t think anyone in Serie A is stopping them
All good runs come to an end eventually One key injury and who knows what could happen An exciting race ahead
That s the difference between Napoli and Juve though We have like 20 players that could make the starting 11 of most top tier teams
You could say the same for Napoli And Juve have a far deeper squad
Yep Napoli losing Higuain would hurt them more than losing Dybala would hurt us
Especially because it looks like Morata is coming back into form
They should count themselves lucky we were not there to draw But honestly though bayern is still better than both juve and napoli but there is a good chance that both could beat them over 2 games
not napoli
It really was a shit start though 14th place at the lowest Chelsea esque And look where Chelsea still is right now They also won the league last year
They seem unstopable in Serie A and if Napoli gets away with the title it will be one of the major upsets of the year and an incredible achievement We are probably about to see a historical Juve in years to come
It s not like Napoli seem stoppable It s a clash of titans this year
Yeah even as an Inter fan it s exciting to see these two teams playing at such a high level
They could legit knock Guardiola out
Also when Juve was doing poorly a lot of top posts were mocking allegri and second season syndrome really berlusconi got sued for half a billion syndrome but now you barely see praise for him Name only comes up 3 times in this post
He is really doing a fantastic job atm I don t want him to leave the team any time soon
It s a credit to how great Guardiola has done that it would be such an achievement but I meant Bayern Munich obviously
Yup same as last yr when we beat dortmund and RM its always cuz the other team sucked not because Juve is good
Feb 23rd in Italy that first leg
I don t want to take away any thunder from Juventus but it is quite an achievement to get the flag of the Netherlands wrong way round for a verified twitter account
Where are you seeing that
Here
Rotated 90 degrees
Great season so far for juve especially how they started I think they have a very good chance against Bayern Allegri doesn t get enough credit for his tactical approach I was hoping we d have more of a cushion in the seria a but oh well Hopefully we can race them until the end
The ignorance towards Napoli is unreal they have been equally unstoppable People saying it would be a massive upset etc if Juventus don t win it need to go watch a few Napoli games They have the best striker in world football atm
Higuain is comfortably the best striker in Serie A Suarez is comfortably the best striker in the world
I wouldn t say comfortably Lewandowski Aubameyang do exist too
If you watch all four of them play and don t look at the stat sheets you could say pretty safely that Suarez is the best striker in the world
Higuain is there with Aubameyang tho
Lewandowski s great but Suarez offers everything he does and more
Like what
Being more consistent No one talked about Lewandowski before his now famous 5 goals in ten minutes
That s absolute bullshit the man has spent the past four years tormenting Bundesliga defenders You must have missed the time he scored 4 goals against Mourinho s Madrid in a CL semifinal Lewandowski is commonly talked about as one of the best Bundesliga strikers ever Pull your head out of you ass
Seriously Youre saying that nobody talked about lewwy before this season
At least not in a worldwide level and frequency we re seeing now
I dont think you have watched football for that long
http www uefa com uefachampionsleague season 2013 matches round 2000350 match 2009608 postmatch report
Sorry I started watching football after the 2014 World Cup
Oh don t worry I think that s longer than the majority of the people in here
And benzema
Suarez doesn t play for Napoli though
That s mostly because Napoli seem too dependent on Higuain but then again if you have a striker with 22 goals in 22 games you ll seem dependent on him no matter what With European games coming back most of the fans expect their results to drop given the more compact schedule while maybe most of them expect us to drop against Bayern and thus have more time between Serie A games I guess we ll see on 13th when we play them directly
This is why we decided to finish second in the group
Wrong They lost to Sevilla 10 wins ago It s their 12 consecutive win the league
Marchiso and Khedira are the reason for this imo Their influence in midfield has been absolutely solid
Khedira is quite good but Pogba and Dybala have been far more crucial Khedira was hurt for much of the early season
That s what I am hinting at Arrival of khedira and marchisio have been the turning point of the season But yes dybala and pogba have also stepped it up
Pogba stepping up is also a reflection of the return of Khedira and specially Marchisio Early in the season Pogba was basically playing by himself in midfield he had to do too much and coudn t handle it
I fully agree
He had Padoin to help him though he should have been grateful for that
That means either Bernat Alaba Badstuber Lahm or this if Bernat is not fit Alaba Badtsuber Lahm
I love that Pep s solution to losing a defender is to throw on a midfielder Obviously not that clear cut but still funny imo
For comparison PSG in on 13 consecutive wins and 18 games without losing record 17W 1D Last loss was against Real Madrid also the only one so far maybe another one tonight at this rate p
Juve is on 14 if you count Coppa Italia too
Then you must count CL to In that case they have only 10
And now both team are on 14 p
Is the bad taste in their mouth from the CL and the young players figuring it after Pirlo and Tevez leaving fueling this
12th
Game changer right here
Tie couldn t come soon enough despite the injuries
I preferred when they were the chelsea of serie a
And now imagine Chelsea winning the remaining 15 games in PL and becoming the Juve of the PL
Impressive And not even that unexpected imo
Has anyone noticed that almost every Morata goal is a tap in or an open net Credit to him his positional play is obviously good though
Watch his winner against City this year Far from a tap in
not a city fan but i went to see that match because tickets were still available on matchday that was a great goal came out of nowhere and pogba was awesome in that match 22 well spent

I feel sorry for you A goal is a goal Thats what a striker is for I guess being a plastic barca fan you got too used to wonder goals from the MSN
He didnt say tap in goals are bad tho He s praising Morata for his position choosing ability Calling him a plastic fan for that is just pathetic
you can t read sarcasm can you
or all of the tap ins that MSN pull off from their amazing positional play too
Didn t Suarez score a tap in in a UCL final last year v
Are Juve better than Maribor
JUVE MERDA

Bayern flair The bait is real
You know they re just as mad about the CL draw as we are if not more
I respect the shit out of Juventus especially after last season but with the draw I ve been wishing the worst upon all of your players and form Until the R16 is over I can t like any of the Juve players
I said this a bunch of times now just play Vidal and Coman they are guaranteed to score agaisnt us same with Mandzukic but then it ends 2 1 to you guys
serie a is not competitive juve are on track to win their 5th straight title and have won 12 games in a row
Because it s only been months since we were top of the table Clearly uncompetitive
even atletico wins la liga sometimes oh no weve been 2nd for a few months in a stretch of 60 months of dominance
So what should they do dont win games to make it competitive
yes that is exactly what they should do or maybe the other teams should get better or maybe tv money should be redestributed more fairly hmm thats an idea
No
We were far off from second for a long stretch You clearly don t follow Serie A
And yet you re still going to win the league this season Does it really matter that you had five bad games at the start of the season when you win it in the end
I appreciate your confidence but you are severely underestimating the strength of the teams within Serie A
So you don t think you ll win the league this season
If we keep current form up and Napoli falters we definitely should With how weird this season has been I wouldn t be entirely surprised if we didn t by a narrow margin To pretend that our win this season was illegitimate because of the lack of competition would be naive though
I don t think anyone is saying Juve winning this season would be illegitimate For many it s just a foregone conclusion already that Juve will win the league this season even after such a bad start
And this coming from a Barca fan The irony
Mate when you re repping a flair for a team that has won the treble 3 times in the past 10 years I don t think you should enter a conversation about how competitive teams are
twice in the last 10 years
Just because the team I like is very successful and the league my team is in is unbalanced doesn t mean I m unable to call other leagues unbalanced Me saying a league is unbalanced doesn t equal me saying La Liga is more balanced or better
Actually we were 4th until 2 weeks ago it s not our fault if the other teams love to choke And at least in Serie A we don t have the same teams in the first 6 places 9 years out of 10
hmm not sure what league youre referencing could it be the premier league notorious for being dominated by the big 4 or la liga which consists of barca real atletico and everyone else or maybe ligue 1 aka PSG and co
So if all the leagues are the same shit in terms of being uncompetitive then why do you have a problem with Serie A lol
cos ppl hold it up as some sort of bastion of equality but really its no better and might even be the worst of the lot no other league has had the same team win the last 4 titles
people routinely trash la liga bundesliga and ligue 1 for being uncompetitive nobody ever mentions the other 2 major leagues which are just as bad
People rag on Juventus walking the league all the time not sure how you ve never seen that before It s only the PL which a lot of people seem to think is super competitive when it s not really
Then what league is competitive in the sense that top teams change every year How are you complaining that everything is uncompetitive when you have no competitive situation to weigh it against
The Premier League in the other leagues the top 6 switches every year
lmao im not sure why you think that would irritate me the prem is obviously uncompetitive serie a is just no better
I don t want to irritate you it s just that most people who criticize other leagues for not being competitive are convinced that the PL is an ultra competitive league
But how is that even relevant to the issue he brought up Clearly he does not care about pl either
thats true and those people do irritate me its annoying when people point out how uncompetitive la liga ligue 1 and the bundesliga are but ignore the fact that juve have won the last 4 titles something thats happened in no other league or that for more than a decade only 3 teams have ever won the prem
I think Serie A is fairly more competitive than La Liga Ligue 1 or Bundesliga because of one reason even though Juventus has been dominating its financial power isn t as incomparable to its domestic rivals as it is for PSG Bayern Barca and Real Milan Inter Roma and on a smaller scale Napoli may not be title contenders right now but they are teams that have started investing recently after struggling for a bit and will eventually rise to the status of contenders The gap between PSG Bayern etc and the rest of the league is huge
Is asking for downvote a thing now
Honestly I don t know why you are being downvoted Serie A has been in a slump for almost 10 years and Inter s treble was honestly a blip This year it is starting to be competitive though A lot of good teams a whole lot of good tacticians and younger players getting the nod Every serious Serie A fan would admit that there is some serious restructuring to be done but they would also tell you that it is moving in the right direction
I mean it is fairly obvious why he is being down voted
Why It s completely true I ve been following Serie A for about 20 years and the way Italian football dropped its advantage on the floor should be a major regret for everyone Stadiums are old attendances and income are low the presidents are fossils that just won t let go the best players seek other leagues and the same teams are winning the league for years Juve has started a modernization that needs to spread to the whole league I still love Serie A more than any other competition but he s right 10 wins in a row is generally not a sign of health but a symptom of a disease I didn t see him stating that La Liga Ligue 1 the Bundesliga Premier League etc are void of problems either
No it s not true He is a troll trying to say the league isn t competitive This season it is definitely competitive from top to bottom Every league has the same top clubs winning all the time because that s how football works If we are 12th after 10 matches were shit and it s all our fault but if we win 12 in a row it s because the league is unhealthy and weak
I don t know if he s trolling don t know him I just don t think it s strictly incorrect The Milan clubs are down and there hasn t been a tight battle for top spot for quite a few years Only Juve have been able to compete in the Champions League This is not a normal situation I think Italian football is getting back up onto its feet but it has been down and there are some parametres where it is still lacking way behind there s no denying that
not a tight battle for top spot there was the year Milan almost took it and there was the year Roma started the season with 10 wins in a row but imploded near the end of the season
lol of course it s not competitive It s fuckin juventus the most crooked club in the history of football It s impossible for the other Serie A clubs to compete against Juventus when you guys control the Italian football If you have self respect you would stop support juventus i would feel ashamed if my club went to serie b because of bribering referees ASHAMED
Dude
Buddy if you actually think Juventus fixed matches or bribed referees then you really have no idea what Calciopoli was about You should read up on it instead of mouthing off It s actually very interesting reading if you do choose to read about it If you re looking for links reply to this post and I ll try to find something for you
If only we were as classy as Arsenal
Some people don t really get to choose who their childhood club is
I don t give a fuck I just hope Napoli wins Serie A because that means it will be a victory from football against corruption which is what Juventus represents
agreed cant think of a reason why any fans would want to support a club other than the epitome of purity and morality that classenal is
You are right mate Also the prem is the only competitive league in the world ever like nobody can come close the competiveness of the prem that s literally the best in the world by FAR even with Man U that have won it like 14 times out of the last 20 seasons
Well 3 different teams have won the past 3 Premier League seasons compared to Juve winning past 4 Serie A titles and Man United has finished 7th and 4th in the past two seasons so they aren t really dominating Plus Leicester is currently top of the table Can t compare the current competitiveness of the PL with Serie A
That s luck You can extend the same thing and say that only 3 different teams have won the last TEN YEARS in the Premier League Chelsea City United Guess what If you keep it nice and extended at 10 years the same thing is true in Italy Just because Juve went on a run doesn t mean the league is less competitive than the EPL The same is also true in la Liga The same is also true in the Bundesliga And I m pretty sure it s the same in France as well Currently Napoli is top of the table in Italy 10 years ago they got promoted to Serie A Juventus finished 7th in consecutive seasons before this run of 4 titles in 2010 and 2011 Milan finished 10th last season 4 years ago they were champions See There really isn t that much difference The only difference is that in England it goes back and forth more than it does in Italy But the numbers are the same over 10 years
Yeah if you keep expanding horizons the result will be different good job for pointing that out The state of the league 10 years ago is not too relevant to the state of the league right now In fact Juve s dominance is hidden by the Calciopoli If you look on from the year 2000 Juve won in 01 02 02 03 04 05 05 06 those two got cancelled due to Calciopoli and once they recovered from the scandal they have since gone on to win 4 titles in a row and will most likely win this year too The fact of the matter is that in the recent past the Premier League as in the title race has been more competitive than the Serie A 4 league titles in a row and the defending champions being on a 12 game winning streak showcases that very well You are of course biased towards the league you follow which is understandable But it doesn t change the fact that the winner of Serie A has become quite predictable
You re picking and choosing the time period that lends itself to your argument though that s my point You picked 3 years because that s what fits best with your argument and I showed that that is a fallacious way of looking at it Sure the last 3 years have seen Juventus dominate but the last 10 years have not Also the state of the league 10 years ago is absolutely relevant You wouldn t have any issue with Juventus dominating now if it wasn t for a history of dominance in the league so right there your logic is contradictory Juve has historically always focused on the league Our league numbers are comparable to other major teams Madrid has won their league 32 33 times as well Porto and Benfica have won 28 and 33 respectively Rangers and Celtic have won 40 each Manchester United has won some 14 out of the 23 seasons of the Premier League that ever occurred which is a much stronger record than Juve Madrid Benfica or Bayern Munich yet you seem to hold up just the past 3 years of the EPL as your example So yeah I believe you re arguing for the sake of arguing picking numbers that suit your argument and ignoring what I ve said because it s inconvenient
Oh fine instead of 3 years I ll use 4 years Come on Who do you think you re kidding You re very clearly just picking what works for you I can just as easily say No football runs in longer cycles and decide that 16 years is most appropriate during which time Juventus Roma Lazio Inter and Milan have all won During that same time there have only been 4 winners of the EPL Chelsea Arsenal City and United Now what Get outta here with that nonsense You re talking about the leagues right now because again you re trying to make a sensationalized point based on a period of time that agrees with your point Look at any of the major leagues there is always one team that wins the most Bayern Juventus Real Madrid Manchester United Obviously when Juventus has won for the past 4 years its easy to say that based on recent history it s easy to tell who will win what complete rot Just because Juve has won the past 4 years doesn t mean Napoli can t win it this year There are 15 match days left ffs Grow up
How about instead of attacking him based on an argument that he didn t even make you actually address what he s saying The guy says that Serie A has balance issues which it does and everyone takes that to mean he thinks every league but the Premiership sucks Where the fuck did he even say that Your combo of ad hominem AND strawmanning is great you re arguing like a child
How else is he supposed get upvotes from the hive then
Exactly And in the same sentence too cannot believe he s been upvoted
The Reddit trope of misunderstanding logical fallacies or using them hypocritically needs to go
Reddit just needs to stop whining whenever people disagree and try to actually facilitate real conversation while understanding that nobody is required by rules to not be pedantic or shallow or sarcastic or anything else Just deal with it
Its so silly how Redditors love to point at each other and scream ad hominem and straw man So what He s clearly being sarcastic are we really at the stage where everyone needs to say s or they ll be accused of ad hominem and straw man Also ridiculous that you follow that up by calling him a child Get real He made a valid point in a sarcastic manner that s it Serie A has balance issues no Juventus fan is going to sit here and tell you that the league has been super competitive for the last 4 years But pointing fingers at the team that s won and insinuating that it s our problem that the rest of the league hasn t been good enough is ridiculous It s not like we ve been some European powerhouse winning the treble 2 3 times in the past 10 years We made the final of the CL once during a period that the entire league practically fell apart we lost the 4th CL spot and clubs were going bankrupt left and right The other clubs in Serie A need to get their act together and they ve started doing that Juve is second behind a scary looking Napoli right now and the league is more competitive today than it has been in ten years That is improvement
i was just joking mate
Hilarious
Yeah attack was a bit of a strong word sorry It s just that I find a lot whenever someone makes a semi controversial or unpopular opinion on this subreddit people don t try and actually dispute it they just make arguments based on things the person didn t even say or refute what the person is saying based on their crest Of course you re not being entirely serious but when people are being serious it s fucking annoying as hell
lol if u think i give a fuck about the prems competitiveness ur badly mistaken the premier league is uncompetitive la liga is notoriously uncompetitive ligue 1 is a joke and serie a is no better
Yeah we should just scrap the top flight of the top 5 leagues Why even bother playing right
its incredible how u lot seem to read my mind when i say serie a is uncompetitive what i actually meant was fuck football what a shit sport
You only care about big leagues like League 1 or League 2 right
Ligue deux Come on Racing club lens or Le Havre since their coach is American and mahrez is from there
mate u got me there but i guess somebody has to support their local club instead of gloryhunting for the biggest team in their country
Well FC Porto is in fact my local team
Remember when people told you serie A was going to be awesome this year
Napoli still leads by 2 points
And it is
Lmaoing at Juve fans thinking they have a chance against Bayern just because they are 12 games unbeaten most of the teams they ve played are shitty bankrupt teams that can t be arsed to defend
over this run they ve beaten Milan Fiorentina Lazio Roma and Inter in the cup Thats not too bad of a list some very solid Italian teamsGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
Sir Roberto Mancini strikes again
In Glasgow that ll get you a 20 game suspension
Clearly Glasgow s full of pussies
Part of me still miss him
The part of me that missed him is slowly dying
I mean you guys started the year well and have fallen off a bit since christmas but Juve and probably also Napoli have a better squad than you at the minute so I m not sure there s really too much to be done The result against Milan was bad I ll grant you but it s hardly time to sack him already Maybe I m biased and you probably have a better handle on what s going on with your club but it seems a little rash to me
I never said I would sack him but his flaws are finally showing 22 games into the season he still doesn t have a starting XI Rotating and changing formations every time is not beneficial for the players We won t gain momentun when one player has 2 good games and then sits on the bench Also his ideas of defensive midfield are pure bullshit Melo Medel Kondogbia in 4 3 3 And then he complains when one of the strikers don t score one of the only chances No striker has 100 conversion rate and its his fault that he sets it up so we only get a few chances per game to score Not to mention his subs 2 0 behind sub in Melo for Peri i Sure damage control Nah we still play attacking but now with Melo But like I said I don t think sacking him would achieve much but it has definitely become frustrating over time
I remember some of those same things from his first few years at City He approaches games with an emphasis on defending and will make substitutions to that effect regularly which can get irritating He s very demanding in this respect and it wouldn t surprise me if his rotation is simply a result of him not being satisfied with performances that might otherwise seem reasonable Once he s had a bit more time to shape the squad to his liking hopefully things will start clicking That s how it went for us
I loved his passion
Manchester City legend forever There was no better man to take City from a loser mentality to winners His fire was incredible
Same
Wasn t this guy complaining about another manager the other week for calling him names
I think giving opposition fans the finger is considerably more acceptable than a manager calling another manager a poof
What a poof Disclaimer Sarri joke
http i imgur com XWz7rCE jpg
Well he fits right in as an Interista thats for sure Mercenary I ll tell him where he can stick that finger
lad
Kinda hypocritical after critics against Sarri
Big difference between saying fuck you and a homophobic slur
Is there really in principle I m not condoning what Sarri said but I mean acting inappropriately is bad no matter how
There s a difference between being a dick and being a discriminating dick
True mancini is both And he s also an hypocritical prick pathetic excuse of a coach Really never one team has been more suited to a coach And vice versa
I don t like Mancini either but you talk as if teams had an identity and a personality Teams change owners players coaches all sort of staff members yet you attack a team as if it was a coherent person with a distinct personality If that was the case what would Roma s profile be may I ask
As a Roma supporter I hate inter because the supporters are affiliated to lazio s supporters Also because of countless of reason I can t list because i can t remember most of them but i know i hate them for reasons Mancini is a hypocritical tool much like inter s board the old one more like therefore I think they deserve each other Don t get me wrong i can t stand milan and mihajlovich either but right now the way inter is playing and because of mancini i hate them more It s simply called being a fan Can t help it P s I also hate milano the city
How do you feel about Verona mate
Noi Odiamo il Verona

We re neutral as a whole They aren t our neighbours they don t seem to hate us they gave us Iturbe but that s not their problem
i m not italian but i don t think it was meant to be homophobic
was he also not being homophobic when he said Football has become a sport for fags We suffered twice as many fouls but we had more yellow cards It s a contact sport in Italy and but the whistle is blown a lot more than in England because of the interpretation by homosexuals
It was tho Frocio is a homophobic word regardless of what Sarri thinks of the word
Exactly the level of class and respect I d expect from Inter No one should be surprised
What a wasteman
As much as that s how we interisti feel that s not cool Show some class Mancio
Banter
What a small small man
He should be suspended for this I kinda want Miha would be just as a bitch as Mancini was against Sarri
overreaction much its a massive derby emotions will run high
Yeah Sarri overreacted and Mancini was a total cunt about it
I m not talking about that
You were talking about Mancini flipping Milan fans right Its the same situation that happend with Sarri
Isn t what Sarri said homophobic I don t know what he said and I don t know Italian So I don t know if what he said might mean something else
In english is homophobic but that word in italian is used all the time The offended people either don t know or conveniently choose to forget it Still the only knob here is mancini
alpha as fuk
I hope he gets fired he s a garbage coach

I don t understand this situation anymore Pulis doesn t use him I know he used him against a League 1 club yesterday and yet the Chairman or whoever won t sell for 21m TWENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS FOR A RESERVE PLAYER
Maybe they are worried about him going to a relegation rival but would accept that sort of offer from a different club
WBA will be fine imo I guess it s possible for them to get dragged into a relegation battle but I just can t see it happening
Don t see Pulis getting them relegated They have the best defensive organisation of any of the teams in the lower half bar palace There are too many worse teams than them
They rejected Stoke s bid didn t they And Stoke are gunna finish top 10 probably
There was an article a week or two ago saying they want 30mil for him now Followed shortly after by one saying he wasn t for sale at all this window
Maybe the West Brom chairman is an avid Football Manager player because Berahino a god on FM 16 Or maybe not
Exactly plus it s an admirable stance that the player can t tell the club what to do WBA should be commended for taking a stance and sticking to it
i mean up to a point yes they shouldn t be pushed around but if they are going to be rejecting these kinds of bids because they re adamant he isn t going anywhere he should really be playing shouldn t he At this point it s going from admirable stance to just plain stubbornness
And then the price for the player dips drastically
If a player doesn t want to play for you and you don t want to use him in matches you have no business blocking their transfer Especially for 21m
It s not admirable in the slightest They neither want to use him nor sell for a very good price Is the plan just to ruin him
I m amazed that so many people are apparently in favour of players being able to boss their clubs around ignore their contracts lay down the law and get everything their own way
The only explanation is that Peace is going to sack Pulis in the summer and he doesn t want to give him the spending money
Then sell him and withhold the transfer money
Unless he wants new manager to use him
TSF confirmed as much in his column
He s not been fully fit recently that s why hasn t played so much If he keeps West Brom in PL he is definitely worth keeping even if he s sold for 10m in the summer
He hasn t started a league game since October though plus WBA will stay up with or without him they only need 3 or 4 more wins and they re better than most if not all of the sides below them
Apart from that can t Berahino go to the PFA for some sort of unfair treatment He s been offered a contract from a different team yet West Brom would rather leave him rot
why he has a contract with WBA he has no right to sign a contract from someone else
Only rational reason what I can think of is that they have several bids for the player and expect to get a bit more in this transfer window
Why does Mike tight ship Ashley willing to spend that much on him as well as Shelvey Has he had a change of heart with transfer policy or what
If they feel like they can get more for him why shouldn t they hold out
He s got 18 months left on his contract they must know won t get 21m in the summer surely They could also save some money by getting him off the wage bill
Apparently they don t want to sell him to a relegation rival Makes sense I suppose
I really don t think WBA will get dragged into the relegation battle but I guess you can never be too cautious with that
21m is a huge amount that is over paying already If they think they can get more then its a risk of not getting anything For Berahino who isn t even playing much thats massive
I m shocked they got offered that much
They rejected more than that in the summer supposedly They aren t going to get much more for a player who has barely played this season and has 18 months left on their contract
He ll just go for even less as his contract runs out especially in the summer when prices are lower January means inflated prices so now when he s not playing much would be a reasonable time to sell IMO Not a West Brom fan but that s my interpretation if they wait until the summer Spurs might come in but for a figure far lower
But why
Wouldn t you much rather 10m in the summer
Ego Rather ironic when you think about it
Nah this is the FM logic Cunty young player tries to force a move so you make him rot in the reserves
Then when he retires hire him as a scout and send him to North Korea for 10 years straight
fucking lol I hadn t thought of that
You re a special kind of evil
I do this quite a lot
Holding him hostage it seems
I wish I could be held hostage for thousands of pounds a week
You re from Colchester you would do it for chips
they literally said not for sale ofcourse after a huge amount they will give in but if they rejected Tottenhams bids of 21m pounds in the summer then surely this wont do it either
But wasn t that when he was in good form and didn t have as many attitude problems seen by the public
either way not for sale means he is not going anywhere regardless of price they feel they need him this season so they wont let him go
They need him this season but they re not playing him Do they need his presence on the bench or something
i have no clue mate im just citing the source
deleted
Yeah but if there s someone who is back up to injured players who wants to leave and you get a 21m offer for him you bloody sell him
Didn t we bid closer to 25m in the end
Absolutely ludicrous Should be taking anything over 20m and running
should be taking anything over 15 really
The only thing more crazy than bidding 21m is rejecting it
We re only accepting offers of 20m
West Brom you absolute bunch of tits they will never get an offer as high as that for him again
deleted
How would not having Berahino affect West Brom s survival hopes if he hardly plays and hardly scores in the first place
but he doesn t play i d understand if he was your top scoring star player he cant make a difference to relegation if they wont play him
He is our top scoring player
Wouldn t 21M be more useful than a reserve player effectively to fight against relegation
But at the moment it doesn t look like he s going to be playing if that situation arises
That s it Walk away Ashley never thought I d be asking him to not spend money
West Brom will be lucky to get a higher offer than that
They were lucky to get an offer that high at this point
After this would any young English talent fancy going to West Brom
Seems to me it s all about egos now
I don t have an ego pls sign
Said this before this situation is solely personal now There is no way West Brom would turn down 21m by now from a player who is stranded in reserves Seems like they want to let Berahino to rot in reserves until he is free agent Awful situation for promising young player Even his attitude cant justify his treatment at this point
I think they ve learnt not to sign Aidy Ward as an agent
Saido fired Aidy Ward as his agent and make THE CLUB his agent stupidest move I ve seen a footballer make in football Good agents are power hungry assholes plain and simple Aidy Ward got his player the move he wanted Berahino s gonna be stuck in the Hawthorns forever thanks to Jeremy Peace
Exactly all depends on perspective We all complain about Aidy Ward and the whole Sterling fiasco but Sterling is the one who is happy right now and Ward works for Sterling Berahino did the right thing in the public and WBA s eyes by getting rid of an agent who is notorious for getting the best for his players at all costs and now look where he is
Except that Aidy Ward actually did get Sterling his move I wonder if Berahino firing him was actually a bad move on his part at this point
Thing is he s gotten Sterling his move at the consequence of marginalising Berahino to the point where Liverpool and other teams were not interested in him anymore Now he s not playing any games for West Brom whilst with any other agent he d probably be playing for one of the top Premier League teams right now
Ward is no longer his agent nor was he when Spurs Newcastle Stoke bid for him
Baffling that they re not accepting that
I thought Saido was being an idiot but this is just stupid and petty from West Brom You have a player who the manager says is lucky to even be on the bench yet you don t want to sell him Its like the whole purpose is to keep him on the bench as long as possible because you don t like him Sell the player so he can move on with his career this is very very stupid for 21m too which is an excellent price for him
I have backed Peace very well and will continue to back him as he has done fantastic things for this club but reject that offer is down right stupid 21 million is a fantastic sum of money for a player who we don t want and doesn t want to be here
Is spiting Berahino really worth 21 million
any other day of calendar year no side facing relegation on last day of transfer window yes
I m not sure why but it had completely gone over my head that today was the final day of the transfer window The 21 million bid makes much more sense now
It s tomorrow
Earth s round etc etc
mad
Wasting a potential good talent just cash in
I don t understand He isn t first choice there despite being their best striker and he wants to leave Every transfer window his price will likely go down He is a good player but he isn t even playing regularly Just sell him and get good money Perhaps they are worried about relegation and don t want to strengthen a rival but they wouldn t sell him to Spurs in the summer either
The only explanation for this is that the club is using this as a statement that they don t put up with transfer bullshit They said they re not selling him and they mean it People can say they don t want to sell to a relegation rival or that they need the squad depth but that s just poor planning on their part Why didn t you scout out players to replace him with in the event you got a good offer It s always lip service
madness from newcastle even more idiotic from west brom
Actually absurd from West Brom Take the fucking money you clowns
Jeremy Peace is a fucking idiot
That seems stupid Pulis obviously doesn t want him and Berahino clearly wants to move What do they think his market value actually is
This has nothing to do with business anymore
The whole Berahino West Brom situation just seems bizarre Surely if they are going to keep on acting this way his value is only going to go down and you arent going to get a desperate club fighting relegation willing to overpay for him in the summer
Idiots
You re mental Peace take the cash
Pulis won t play him but won t sell him good times
Bloody idiots Then again I m not sure I d trust Pulis with that money given his way of tactical thinking
West Brom are fucking nuts I d bite Toon s hand off for that if I were them
Then you guys should sell us Mahrez or Vardy Cashley s clearly willing to get the cheque book out Should we say 750m
Make it a cool Billion and we ll talk
Jeremy Peace is an idiot I would have sold him this window for 15m or higher 21m is an outrageous bid
Not too surprising he is talented and they aren t going to do much with the money on deadline day just keep him and use him when necessary
I suppose seeing as they re both in a relegation battle west brom s rejection makes a little more sense Still can t see them getting that in the summer
How are we in a relegation battle
It s a tight season and you re only 7 points from safety 2 wins and one draw One bad run of from and you re down there You never know and the last thing you want to do is give a talented striker to a team who could go on a good run any day now while you may have a bad run
That was quick
I hate you albion I love you and I hate you Why must you hurt me with your decisions WHY
If I remember correctly Ashley only pays in cash maybe they were hoping to add a sell on fee to get a sizable cash injection a few years down the line
That s more dumb
Can t see getting any better offer for him
This is absolutely mental You want to be rid of him you don t play him and at that price it s well worth it At this point he s probably worth 10 15 Maybe A striker who doesn t play and possibly has major attitude problems Only reason I can fathom is that they don t have time to replace him and don t have quality depth
I think West Brom is hoping this turns out like Arsenal s bid for Luis Suarez A want away striker is slowly convinced to stay for at least the time being Berahino is only 23 and he still could feature for the side if he s given time
Daft
Jeremy Peace seriously needs to wake up and smell the coffee
Thank you I just don t see the lad doing well at NUFC
Probably the upfront fee wasn t high enough
Been confirmed the up front fee was 21m We don t deal in instalments only cold hard untraceable notes It s the cockney way
Cockney Mafia Ashley and Co s policy to only deal in cash

Ashley is a cockney
That was the upfront fee
no he is not for sale they said im not sure what everyone think that means but to me it sounds like we wont sell him this window
Couple more mill and they ll get him Just trying to milk Newcastle although risky move
Keep him forever Peace Good luck with that I could give a fuck less at this point cause his talent can t be worth dealing with you And that s from a Daniel Levy fan
It s because we made a 70m bid obviously s

Can t disagree with that though If Berahino keeps you up comfortably then he s already paid more then 21m back in the guaranteed new revenue
deleted
Think you meant Jeremy Peace Pulis has no control over this
Rumours are that it s not 21m cash and includes clauses relating to Newcastle staying in the prem Might be able to see why the owner wouldnt want to bank on Newcastle s survival when he could get more stable cash from another club
Based on Ashley s policy of cash upfront I doubt there s many conditions in there He s done pretty good at balancing the books and having us in debt to no one but himself
We re in a lot more debt to him after this transfer window thoughGet your team crest from soccerbot News results and discussion about the beautiful game Follow the rules of our community Read the FAQ and wiki Our submission guidelines Create a match thread icons bars Discover related subreddits Submit a banner picture Question Message the mods Follow us on Twitter Read r Soccer Watch r Soccer Banners New signing Artem Kravets scores the winning goal for VfB Stuttgart against HSV to help them secure their 3rd win in a row 2 1 A Rossi goal is not enough for Levante as Sevilla win 3 1 and take all three points Valencia coach Gary Nevile is booed by the Mestalla after a 0 1 loss to Sporting Gij n Newcastle have signed Ivory Coast striker Seydou Doumbia on loan from Roma Pep Guardiola to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City boss next season
A couple of months ago Pep called Kimmich his son Kimmich stated in an interview that that slightly irritated him and his family Now this D
no big deal he only said something like My Mum and Dad called me up and said what s up that Pep is calling me his son Edit and I don t exactly call him Pep Papa
hahahah
haha
ha
h
ha
hah
I thought that was jokingly said Sometimes Pep exaggerate things but it seems he likes Kimmich very much
It would be pretty funny if Pep just decided to talk a bunch of shite like this to fuck with Kimmich
I remember he referred to Keita and Mascherano as his little girls once
Really Where were you when Brendan Rodgers used to call Sterling a beautiful boy and rub Sterling s head very slowly

Huh When did he coach Vardy What opportunity did he have to get contact with Vardy
He didn t He called him young Vardy on the tele a few weeks days back That lad obviously thinks that it s a meme now
I apologise profusely please don t judge me based on that shitty joke not good at making jokes anyway apologies everyone I ll leave it up so I get my deserved shame
masochist eh
I read that in Tommy Wiseau s voice don t ask me why
Add it to the list u return 0

I would love to see Neuer put in a shift at centerback
it would be pretty cool to see a normal fixture but every single player played very out of position like if we were to play you in this form have gini as goalie mitro ayoze as CBs mbemba as the lone striker you could use de gea in midfield fellaini as a LB martial the RB rooney CB etc it would be fun to watch
We can do that in one of those charity matches Will sure attract more audience Neuer at leftback Thiago as a goalkeeper
It would be a good training ground exercise for players to learn their counterparts roles Both for when they attack to know how to confuse their defender or when they track back how to predict and understand their defensive counterparts actions
I d prefer striker
Sounds like a bit of back room grooming
Here you go for the Neuer part https twitter com iMiaSanMia status 693880907762122756
I thought about it for few seconds after I heard Javi was injured seriously
Apparently he has forgotten that Ulreich is injured too
at one point everyone would lose track Who remembers 15 names in a different language anyway
sweet boy
To be honest I don t think Bayern should go for another CB They have Bernat back who can play as a LB while Alaba is slotted into the CB with Badstuber
Was this stated in English or translated May make the difference And part of me hopes that Neuer bit was more than a joke
Translated why would Pep speak in English to German journalists
He resorts to English when the German word escapes him Also the twitter account you ve sourced also fails to say what journalists he s speaking to
Honey sweet Glazed We need to know Pep
Looks like Peps been taking lessons from our man Brendan in complimenting
Hmm so those rumors about Pep might be true
Don t be ridiculous
I heard from some Spanish friends that Pep you could say plays for the other team
Barcelona
u return 0 Hey u should at this to the list XD
gay
underage
nice name
He s 20
I don t think anyone got what I was implying I was not referring to Kimmich lol I was implying xxx dragonslayer325 was underage because of his stupid post also his username if un ironic is definitely an indication of underager haha
Oh yeah that s probably true
deleted
again that is not what I was referring to see this post I did
