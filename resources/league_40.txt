PROJECT Poro
Looking so cool Is there a Project Poro ward Didn t see it on the page
No but if people really enjoy the PROJECT Poro icon I d certainly fight to get one made
Yes
Would this fight include snowballs
We don t have those in southern California
Business trip north
You do now
im in MN please take all this snow
Pls and thank you

what else can you fight to get made
Quick question If I buy one of the discounted Legendary skins say Alien Invader Heimer will I get a free mystery skin
Yes any Legendary skin can start the snowball
YES
Does baron have a santa hat on PBE like last year
Santa hat or riot
The Snowball Legendary Skin looks hilarious I can t wait for a reddit post showing someone getting 3 of them
Reddit pls
DO I SEE ICONS FOR IP IS THIS REAL LIFE
Yes although you can only send the snowball icons to friends can t buy for yourself
Tfw no friends
I can t wait for I need a friend with 400IP posts I ll be one of the people to make one
I gotchu if you re EUW
Add your smurf account and gift to your main account problem solved
Was already planning to do that
The blue minion icon is 1500 ip
My new soloq strat Snow Day Bard Penguin ward skin to kill my enemies with cuteness
Alternatively Dragon Trainer Tristana Penguin ward skin
Alternatively Snowday Bard and Riggle ward skin
Alternatively Dragon Trainer Tristana Riggle ward skin
I will buy Snow Day Bard and die of starvation I MUST HAVE THAT SKIN
15RP for mystery icon That can t be right Edit Looks like they fixed the typo its now 150RP
Yeah lol that would be free Peobably 150 RP
u wizardcrab So does the legendary snowball thing work for the legacy Twisted Fate and Heimer skins while they are on sale If so I will definitely pick up the heimer one Would have grabbed Trist too but the dates don t overlap
I guess they do Probably shouldn t have overlapped those sales with Legendary Snowball mistake on my part benefit on yours I suppose
3 awesome thanks
Good Guys u WizardCrab Giving all the good summoners of the rift a discounted attempt at legendary snowball
Thanks a lot mystery chest for already giving me both of these skins And Firefighter Trist is one of the legendaries left that I actually want
The reign of Pingu draws near
He s not even out and he already has a 150 winrate what the fuck
THE LEGENDS WERE TRUE
I summon Exodia the Forbidden One
Exodia Impossible Nobody has ever summoned him before
Why Because he s so rare
No it s because this game makes no sense Nobody could figure it out
Rarer than the rarest of pepes
Indeedplease note pepezodia may not actually be rare
I THOUGHT THOSE WERE JUST KIDS TALES
that syndra skin looks sick
Dem some nice legs Bard and Gnar also look great IMO
Aren t they always
I d prefer her to have white hair like in the original skin but I will probably get it anyway
I m already happy with my Justicar skin but I m definitely picking up Syndra s new one I d go for Gnar s too if I owned him honestly
This is really cool but no snow map
Howling Abyss serves as the new snow map
Blame the community for that one
It doesn t say anyone know if the older snowday legacy skins will be available for individual sale things like toy soldier GP or festive maokai
They will
What s your favorite Legendary skin
Snow Day Bard Oh wait you said Legendary Snow Day Bard isn t legendary In that case I d have to say Snow Day Bard Snow Day Bard Snow Da Damn you know I m having a hard time talking about my favorite anything without responding with Snow Day Bard Favorite color Snow Day Bard Favorite season Snow Day Bard I think my favorite Mexican restaurant right now is Snow Day Bard I just want it soooo bad
This resonates with me on a spiritual level
Is there by any chance a png with higher resolution of the Snow Day Syndra from the promo page This one I would love to make a wallpaper out of that positioning
Sorry that s as high res at it gets
Is there a wallpaper to go along with this majestic Bard picture
any idea why there is no Winter Wonder Orianna plus is dragon train tristana eligible for this whole legendary mysteryskin kerfuffle
Winter Wonder Orianna will be available with all of the other Legacy Snowdown skins at the beginning of the event individually and in a bundle DT Trist is indeed eligible once Legendary Snowball starts later in the month
Yes but you will have to wait until December 23rd to buy her
I wonder if there s a chance she ll show op on the special shop if you play a lot of trist
Legendary Snowball seems kinda weird So I should buy 50 worth of RP now but only buy the Legendary skins when the deal starts on the 23rd of next month
Does the free mystery gift apply for gifting a legendary skin If so who would get the mystery skin
Whoever gets the Legendary also gets the mystery skin
hmmm but what if the mystery skin unlocks an untimate
Can someone explain to me what the snowdownshop is
It will be a separate little thing you click into in the client that has personalized deals for you that Riot some how cooks up only you will have these sales other folks won t have the same sales
Thank you very much for clearing it up for me
Wait are we going to be able to buy skins individually instead of in a bundle
For sure All of these skins are available individually
Glad to hear that Was worried there for a minute
deleted
Yes that s what they said and that s how the legacy sales worked the past years
Yup i think she ll be 975
Are those arts for new Snow Day skins parts of group splash art
You da man thank you 3
Wow thanks
I hope so but it doesn t look that way apart from the user specific shop sales sigh
Can we take a second to appreciate how amazing and unique each event page has been for the last couple of months
Finally Riot listened we can do something with our IP at an Event I m also really looking forward to that Snowdown Shop and I m hoping for some sweet sales D
Just so you know the Snowball icons for IP aren t specifically meant to be an IP sink or anything They re only 100 IP after all They re more of a fun thing anyone can do that only takes a game or two to earn enough to be able to participate And they re sooooo cute
Yea I actually meant it s nice to get something at all for free IP ofc it s not a huge IP sink but that s fine for me And I also like that you can buy that one Icon with IP aswell I like having at least one Icon for each event the way it was before all icons started costing RP Are you planning on doing more quests to earn Icons at future events again
Winter is coming and so am i
No Poro balls for Syndra
It would be cruel to hurl 6 Poros to violently crush someone Even Syndra can t bring herself to do that
Bards throws penguins that explode into enemies
Penguins Not poros Huge difference there
this looks COOL and all but i was really hoping for a summoners rift map this year but i was probably expecting too much
A lot of people complained about the clarity with the last one so they probably listened
The Snowdown map had issues with visibility and etc
Cho rupture never forget
Santa bard best skin 2015
Poro King
Oh my god that Syndra skin shall be mine
Question do i need to buy a Legendary to start that or can i just go for misterys and it could start from that too
You can from gifts but self purchase mystery skins won t be active at the same time Also the mystery skin received from buying a Legendary skin might just have double the normal chance of getting a Legendary out of it but you didn t hear it from me
Will Snowday Orianna be available to purchase as well as all of the other old winter skins or was that a one time deal last year
So if you buy Dragon Trainer Tristana legendary skin you will get a free mistery gift I was going to buy her anyway
First I was happy because I thought the Snowdown Showdown comes back but only the Poro King Mode
Will legendary skins like Primetime Draven or Surprise Party Fiddlesticks count for the Legendary Snowball event Those skins are listed as legendary under the store but they re priced lower than the usual legendary skins 975 rp vs 1820 rp
Yes They re Legendary With all the rights and benefits conferred thereby
in the euw store they aren t labeld legendary O o
It says our Snowdown shop is in the league store how do we access it
Just does DJ Sona count as legendary
I m pretty disappointed about old winter skins available only through bundles except for Snow day skins but overall there are good sales RIP wallet
I think wizardcrab already answered that they ll all be available individually
I think so too
Will Bad Santa Veigar be available outside of the bundle
Noxus Poppy on sale Poppy rework Happiness
The penguins are competing with the poros to see whos cuter AND THE PENGUINS ARE WINNING
I just want an Ashe skin for this snowdown
That penguin ward Hgnnnn take my money Riot
Holy crap I ll probably buy a legendary skin just to try the snowball and get immediately disappointed that I didn t got another one
We can buy icons with IP We did it Reddit right
If you still have an Icon from the previous Snowdown does it also give you a Poro with a tophat that follows you like last year
I can finally get the singed skin
Watch Riot forget to put the santa hat on Baron again
Does anybody know the prices of the bundles if you already own the champs the usually give that price but they didnt this time
This Christmas dump all your money on RP so you can get tons of snow themed skins half a dozen ward skins that you ll quickly forget about and icons that change the appearance of a specific environmental creature that appears on a single map
You know nothing Jon Snowdown
I thought this was the year my well endowed poro idea was finally gonna take off
Why no Mistletoe LeBlanc
no 1v1 game mode then
LEGENDARY SNOWBALL I m waiting for the Reddit posts of someone buying 1 legendary and ending up with 3
Still no Christmas Eve skin Come on riot step up your game
Kennen deserves a new skin
This and bonus RP at the same time Rip my wallet Rito
Bonus RP ends on the 7th which is the same day that the legacy vault opens so you may want to stock up on Bonus RP beforehand so you can prepare for stuff like the bundles and Your Snowstorm Shop which won t be active till slightly later into the month
Legacy vault opens a bit after the 7th But yeah the idea is we wanted to get out the info on all of the many Snowdown deals and offers while Extra Bonus RP was still running this way you guys can make informed decisions on purchasing RP while that promo is running
Wouldn t bonus RP technically reduce the money you spend
It makes you want to buy even more At least for me O
Sweet That ward is adorable I really do miss the Showdown mode from a few years ago though Thing was a blast
No Poro Rider Sejuani I m sad I didn t know that skin would be legacy when it came out so I didn t buy it then
She ll be there All past Snowdown skins will be available as well The top section only features the Snow Day skins because that s the theme this year
Ah sweet Thanks
Hey u WizardCrab will the non seasonal legacy skins such as Mr Mundoverse Butcher Urgot Noxus Poppy and the dozens of others going on sale between 12 16 and 1 7 also be in the shop for full price the entire duration or will only the 6 skins be available on sale each day
Full price the whole duration until 1 7 except the 1 day that each goes on sale for 50
thanks
It s in a bundle
God damn 15RP icons It better be a mistake because that shit seems really good I wish the mystery wards would be cheaper or at least the wards I wanna buy some so bad but they are so expensive
Mystery Icons are 150 RP
Welp rest in pixels
Can t spell RIP without RP
So looks like there is no winter map again I miss the winter map from S1 S2
If i gift myself a legendary skin through another account who will get the bonus chest then
The account receiving the gift
oh shit you cant legendary mystery gift yourself that s fucked up
Curious about the Snowdown shop I wonder whether I will be able to grab Dunkmaster Darius with a nice discount Amazing idea with the upcoming bard skin and this shop thing Last time I was tempted to buy more than 600 Rp was with the Sugar Rush event
This is pretty cool but I hope they announce a snowy Summoner s Rift like they did in Season 3
Where s Winter Wonder Lulu
Im slightly upset we cant buy a PROJECT Poro Ward Skin
Hm i remember some of the old skins getting a certain border for being legacy skins when they came back will new legacy skins such as the certain snow skins Sivir Lulu or Challenger Ahri be getting the same
You spelled battle cast wrong on the battle cast poro icon BATLLE CAST
Will a Legendary skin from a mystery gift without actually buying a legendary also trigger that mystery skin chain u WizardCrab
damn it riot stop it i need to buy christmas presents not awesome skins and wards and icons STOP IT
GET HYPE
my festival kassadin skin is safe from the masses
Are the IP win boosts from the snowballs stackable Also can you throw more than 4 snowballs at 1 person
rip christmas skins
Do we have to buy the Poro snowball icons again so we can use them as a skin in the game
Is the bonus RP happening in OCE Just wondering
I misread this as Snowden is coming I want to take this opportunity to point out that Snowden is not needed in LoL We have Doublelift for that
Will the showdown legacy bundled champions also be available individually
no urf
I will start fasting today RIP breakfast lunch dinner snacks
Aw Toy Soldier Gangplank is bundledThe buyers must have some serious cash if they actually have hope of signing a good roster as most of the good players are probably bought out already
I ll buy the rest they can stay with me at my parents house and all I ask is 60 of all stream revenue
I would be taking a big risk doing this all I ask is a small salary for myself
Nicely referenced
Gotta have that small salary on the side
60 of stream revenue from streamers that won t get over 200 isn t really something to brag home about
Will they all get turns fucking your mother aswell
Well if they manage to get Cabo Dexter Diamond Shook Froggen Tabzz Forgiven Hjarnan in case he leaves Gosu Kasing it seems a pretty solid lineup
Considering it seems EU players are getting paid peanuts it might not be hard
RIP r ElementsGG was a good time with you
I still hold out hope where will my flair turn to now CLG eu is long since crushed
Don t know about you but I will simply follow wherever our lord and saviour Froggen goes p hopefully not NA tho
Just use a Froggen flair like me
ill follow Froggen and Tabbz i hope he gets a team Even tho i follow Froggen for the most time i really hope Tabbz gets to play in a good team too
Apparently it is NA
Agree
Anivia of course
I know that feel bro what will happen with our flairs Gravity in my case
yeah we had our highs and lows but it was fun after all D
I guess hope most of us will probably find each other on another sub soon
Welp time watch Doublelift s stream for the Froggen leaks
TSM FROGGEN s
I mean tsm picked up doublelift now its time for the random role swaps TSM Froggen playing support incoming
Froggen Blitz OP
Support Anivia IS the best right now
Froggen is mid bjerg jungle
All I want for christmas this year is froggen in a decent team where the infrastructure is working already
Froggen don t need infrastructure Oh wait that s Wickd I m thinking of
because that will boost him into a non passive play making player who carrys his team right hes still living in s2 he has mechanics and never uses them
http www goldper10 com article 2034 rumors of froggens decline have been greatly exaggerated html
The stats are backwards You realize if your getting gold while your teams consistently down on team gold its because there taking objectives and your farming mid
Are you even watching the games The only games elements won were the ones that he was rampaging on ahri and stuff or he was doing so and they still lost
S A L T Mad he s better than xPeke LMFAO
in your opinion xpeke didnt need to make plays this split cause the other lanes could different is froggens needed to carry and he cant
Sadly hes going to na
NA has some decent looking teams and is investing in lots of infrastructure I know it goes against the dank NA sucks memes but there are many worse choices of places to go
You re right but some people just don t like watching NA
I hope this time Froggen end up on a team that can go to S6 worlds at least
it s an even season
Froggen undefeated in S6 Confirmed
Froggen is gonna get Kabum confirmed
Froggen San Francisco Giants confirmed
Yeah not sure why they chose to disband instead of playing to their strengths
rumor is that the purchasers of the gambit spot are picking up Cabochard and kasing which can be the start of a decent team that froggen can easily fit into If it is true for me the preferred lineup would be Cabo Shook Froggen Hjarnan and Kasing
great so cabo and kasing will be on every eu team
cabo says yes to every team
Except Roccat
Yep out of all these rumor one of them has got to be true right xD unless of course theirs a cloning device we don t know about
Ask the chinese
Found svenskeren bois
That s racist
They just started a major cloning project for meat production I think it was referring to that and not to the fact that many Asian people look similar to western people
Nice save
So cabo and kasing are on gambit fnatic roccat
And H2k
and tsm
Well to be honest everybody is on TSM according to the fan rumors
I hear TSM pays so well they manage to get kasing yellowstar and even peekaboo
Don t forget Adrian
and my axe
There hasn t been anything substantial supporting Cabo and Kasing on Fnatic It s just commonly accepted speculation
apparently
Don t forget Forg1ven although he didn t mention him this time p
Cabochard is literally on every single EU LCS team by now We ve heard rumours of superteam Roccat then Elements then H2k then Fnatic now the purchasers of Gambit spot
FNCROCELH2k5pointfuking5k Cabochard
yes
Replace Hjarnan with Forg1ven and that is a team I want to see
Hj rnan is a solid ADC in his own right and Forg1ven is likely going to H2k
Rumored line up has nukeduck on that roster you hinted as mid Roccat would feature steve diamond betsy jebus edward cryngeworthy i know And froggen as of said by himself and knowledgeable ppl in the scene is 90 going to NA my guess is to the team that would buy either top or gv spots
Imagine the fight for 1 place between this team and H2K Holy shit
and Origen ofcourse
With Shook on the team they will fight for 1 one day and 10 the next
2 spot after OG crush everybody
Why do people consider Shook over Dexter Dexter was EASILY one of the better players on Elements last split I would say he is a worse version of Svenskeren Even when his team was getting merked he was at least trying to make something happen on the map Shook could only ever perform on one champion Lee Sin and he was notorious for being very inconsistent a tilt monger
I guess it he easier to be hyped for potential greatess than guaranteed averageness
He was very inconsistente but his highest highs i would say were unmatched so under good managent and leadership he could turn great worth the shot imo meanwhile dexter is consistently average
Now now his Riven wasn t bad
Shooks elise was mechanically insane
Froggen is going in NA And your lineup is nuckeduck in mid
I think diamond and nukeduck will be on that team and not froggen and shook
implying knowledge of what team a pro player fits into never change reddit
Cabo Dexter Shook Froggen Forgiven Kasing sounds better
Perhaps he goes to TSM and becomes a full time streamer while waiting for a better oppertunity
Why would he stream for TSM What s preventing him from streaming by himself
The TSM stamp just gives a whole lot of extra viewers Also he would have a place to stay and perhaps benefits if those are awarded to streamers
TSM would be taking a cut of his earnings and the brand does not garner extra viewership Look at the Rainman he gets less than 100 viewers whenever he streams
ya no shit jwaow wants to keep playing i doubt he would find another lcs team
FNC Froggen new support
I guess Froggen to NA just became more of a reality
So far it seems like the only NA mids will be Pobelter and Shiptur
Well that s what money does I guess
That s right Why risk bringing up NA Challenger talent Innox Youngbin Arcsecond when you can just buy safe bets like Froggen or GBM
I still have a kinda hard time seeing Innox being praised as young talent now as opposed to all the hate he was getting on Winterfox with Krepo Snoopeh and Yellowpete as their toplaner
I thought it was Evil Geniuses
Thats why NA sucks anyway when all the orgs rather spent money on imports than developing their region Traditionally with sports there will be league from elementary school to college so that talents will have places to develop and show their worth then the best players will be scouted onto a professional team For us We are skipping all the steps and only having the LCS how do you expect us to compete with others
Agreed the fear of a player not working out scares a lot of top level teams and new orgs from taking chances on players that could be stars given the proper infrastructure and training That s the price of auto relegation I suppose I know this is off topic but what s your feelings on the new LCS format Personally I think it s garbage and they should have copied the LSPL format just with less teams
Don t like the new format but figured Riot wanted to change with the new season s game length
Did I miss something What is the new LCS format o
Short term solutions over long term development
Froggen vs Alexich hype
Would be hilarious to see those two players play against each other in NA
I don t find it funny
Who cares the rivalry with his danish mid brethren is more interesting Bjergsen and Incarnati0n
NA LCS to be renamed DK LCS
i hope he stays in EU tho after the Korean exodus this season is looking more and more like a European exodus froggen has always been associated with EU would be a shame to lose him
Honestly if Froggen leaves too EU is dead Not because of the level but because it won t be interesting anymore
You re overreacting It s not like big EU names haven t gone to NA before Either they ll be back in a split or two or they ll be replaced by new talent
Who has gone to NA then went to a different region and is still relevant Heck not even relevant who is still at least middle of the pack Steelback Quantic people Maybe Vasilii or other LMQ people
Mor is on QG
Dexter Amazing
What big names have left EU prior And please don t say Bjergsen he wasn t a big name when he left Until this season no popular and good players have left for NA apart from Edward s stint in NA in season 3 Literally no season 5 team in NA had a EU player on their team that had done at least most of a split in EU before going It s not like big EU names haven t gone to NA before is just untrue The best example there is is Alex Ich and he was only going from one challenger team to another anyway since his chances in Europe were done
Bjergsen star player of his team and top 5 EU midlaner Amazing star player of his team two time week MVP and one of the best junglers of the 2014 EULCS Spring Split Incarnation The most hyped teamless player of 2014 and early 2015 in Europe up untill he got signed by Cloud 9 Dexter Played for a top 2 EU team at the time he went to play for CLG Krepo Snoopeh and Yellowpete three players of one of the two most popular line ups in Europe throughout season 2 and season 3 And then you ve already mentioned Alex Ich and Edward
I m not a TSM fan or even a bjerg fan Only salty EU fans say bjerg was nothing when he went to NA He was shitting on everyone in EU just held down by a bad team You try carrying Youngbuck Let me know how that works out for you
How much time until LCS starts If they don t sell in time we could have another Lemondogs season 4 situation
iirc it won t start until january
They still have like a month and 3 weeks LCS usually starts mid january
The Elements will destroy you
I really hope Froggen gets a good team next season
Guys I think I ve found out who the buyers are
Fresh memes Get them while they re still before they go dank
Wouldnt it be Get them before they go dank
Fuck me I m going to have to ninja edit that into my post
But wouldn t you want them to already be dank
Nothing surprising really Na Vi potential buyer
Na Vi said they wanna create challenger team
Why would you create a challenger team when you could just buy a spot in LCS
To test your enviroment coach analysts If you fuck up in CS you can change something during split and be hopeful for better results since competition is more forgiving
But team owner Jacob Maelk Toft Andersen hasn t responded to his multiple inquiries about the topic That s absolutely hilarious Not if you re Jwaow tho
not even suprised about this D
CLG Froggen Boys
I would love this
If CLG got Froggen they would probably put him in the jungle knowing CLG
Back to his root But he be on CLG NA this time instead of CLG EU
froggen forgiven in 1 team pls
I m starting to wonder if there even will be buyers for all these spots
Probably but between this and the need for a better format scheduling I m starting to think that expanding the leagues to 10 teams was a mistake
Why in EU it are GMB and Elements for sale 2 old esport orgs UOL H2K and GIA the new orgs seems to deliver G2 and FE have also full rosters
Damn I m not sure EU LCS will even be remotely recognizable anymore
If froggen goes to NA I m gonna fucking kill myself
RemindMe 420 days Did u TPinkman really kill himself after Froggen re joined CLG
rip u TPinkman
please no
Super team with Froggen round 2
Btw if you guys missed it Froggen said on stream few days ago that there s a good chance he s going to NA
EU WHYYYYYYYY WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME I mean at least Froggen and maybe Dexter will likely go to NA LCS which is basically made up of Korea Europe anyway
Damn EU and NA looking super different next split I think froggen and dexter are going to NA thats why dexter chose to play under NA residency so they can import another player kr cn eu
EU seems like it s falling to pieces I don t blame them if it was me I d just make as much money as I could with the small length career I d have
Its just the sad fact of Europe Too many things are going against EU Average income is way less than NA discretionary income even more so due to high taxes in many Euro countries If the UK was a U S state it would be 49th or 50th in disposable income The median income of Germany adjusted for cost of living would be dead last in the U S Also the fan base is fragmented by nationality and language to an extent not existent in the U S The few countries that can compete with the U S in these fields like Norway Luxembourg Switzerland etc are all tiny populations that can t offer the same net sums an NA team could If it werent for the residency rule in a few years if esports continues to grow EU would probably lose all of its top tier talent to NA EU really needs some large multinational companies that can afford to take a yearly loss to overpay a quality team or else they wont be able to compete in the future
But CS GO Europe orgs are the best iirc are you saying that NA CS GO orgs just aren t dishing out the competitive money that they do for LoL
Not to detract from your post but I was interested in the Better Life Index as I hadn t heard of it before and I noticed the link you had was just for average disposable income and on the overall OECD Better Life Index page the United States was actually ranked 7th behind multiple European Countries including Sweden Norway Switzerland and Denmark with the other two ranked above it being Australia and Canada as you can also see here Also these kind of rankings fluctuate depending on the institute doing the research According to several others US has the highest average gross income but not the highest disposable income in which it is beaten by 3 to 4 European countries You earn more and pay more before you can spend it Also 15 of your country has no medical insurance and 15 of Americans live in poverty http www heritage org index ranking http www movehub com blog disposable income world map The reason why the US is even in the top 5 in these kind of rankings is because it has a large number of super rich people skewing the average a lot upwards When we look at the median wealth it looks a lot different 2013 https i imgur com 1TzF6eN png It became even worse this year Americans median wealth is a mere 44 900 per adult half have more half have less That s only good enough for 27th place below Japan Canada Australia and most of Europe Luxembourg Belgium France Italy UK Switzerland Finland Norway Netherlands Ireland Spain Denmark Austria Greece Sweden Germany and Slovenia have more median wealth per adult in 2015 There are many reasons why middle class incomes are suffering including the decline of unions power the shift of jobs overseas and the increasing use of technology in the workplace but Americans still tend to think of their middle class as being the richest in the world It turns out in terms of wealth they rank fairly low among major industrialized countries Super rich Americans skew average wealth upwards The U S has 42 of the world s millionaires and 49 of those with more than 50 million in assets Home ownership rates are higher in many European countries than in the U S giving Joe European more assets to his name than his American counterpart Plus it s easier for Americans to borrow money which eats away at their net worth Plus the tax in other countries is also higher because of the free healthcare and development aid paid as you can see here or here
OG the last hope
Well now its highly likely were going to see Froggen in EU Along with maybe dexter
Millenium NaVi or Virtus Pro inc
WTF is up with this pre season
George R R Martin took time off to write the script
Dark times for EU LCS
I really hope that means we get Roccat for IEM
Which Roccat But at least I hope they will come up with a full roster soon
Froggen to NA confirmed
this makes me so sad Q Q
well man this makes me wonder dexter declaring NA residency rumors of froggen comming to NA maybe dexter froggen someone else from elements comming to NA
League of Selling Spots
Preseason please
Huh That s a thing
Theoretically what would happen if nobody purchased a team for sale What would riot do Make them field a team Do a tourny to see who gets the spot I feel that a CS team could potentially purchase the spot but if riot would just hold a tourny to see who gets it wouldnt that be cheaper With all of these spots for sale in both regions what would happen if one of them does not get sold it time
NiP come back please
This is worrying for the LCS and LoL esports in general At this rate will Korea NA and EU even have enough teams to compete in a league format

Froggen s real chance to make a power rangers super team
man what a sad and disappointing conclusion to the Forced EG and Alliance break up Two of the biggest Brands in Esports not being allowed in LCS sucks and what a failure it was watching Elements and Winterfox try to come out of that
So what happened to alliance again
Whoever bought Dig s spot must be really kicking themselves after seeing all these spots go up for sale right after
They didn t buy dig s spot they bought dig
Most of the teams that disband are build around a single roster without any substence or organisation If we want eSports to grow we need more stable organisations who can weed out these lackluster once
Good grief LCS is going to be unrecognizable once all these sales are done
I m not entirely sure on the rules does this mean any one can buy a spot can enter the LCS if we won the bid
Mark Cuban now s your chance
Aaand Riot s LCS rulings close circuit prove themselves to be shit tier again Isn t this like the 4th team that s selling its spot for Spring 2016 This is so fucking ludicrous I keep getting more and more astonished at how people can support the way Riot handle LCS Just give the spot to Froggen co and let them build a new fucking team without an org behind them If they re good they ll be picked up Oh wait players earn jackshit from LCS and it s all about salary and sponsors because muh stability nice joke Riot Just have the loser of promotion tournament get the spot then Giving spots to whoever buys them is freakin bullshit I get so sad everytime I see how LoL competitive scene is ruined by Riot itself It could be an awesome esport if they actually gave any fuck about the scene to be more than a marketing tool If Riot doesn t want to invest in it to actually be good and REALLY competitive why can t they just let third part organizations do it themselves It worked wonders with Dota2 and CSGO Just keep Worlds and MAYBE MSI but with a decent format and 16 teams and let ESL Dreamhack whoever do the work There s no way it could end up worse than LCS
This could be interesting for Europe mostly just interested in seeing where Froggen goes though Can t see a good number of options for him to be on an elite team tbh
I don t think he needs an elite team A decent foundation and he can aim for any missing bits in spring split
fuckin lmao pre season drama
It s almost like they are trying to consolidate talent and make 1 super league
CLG Froggen Hotshot make it happen PLZ
With all of the Team Sales and Disbanding across all of the major leagues a thought occurred to me why cant there be hemispheric super leagues i know in some instances it could stifle some of the regional revenue made by the individual leagues but if you want to keep the league system and maintain a level of competitiveness while all of these exudouses are happening in the superior talent driven leagues in each hemisphere east korea west EU to the more lucrative leagues east china west NA then why dont we just have like what the football scene has you can have League of Legends Champions League West and East LCLW and LCLE invite the top 4 teams from the major leagues and 2 wild card spots for the smaller leagues West Latam Brazil OCE CIS East LMS SEA JPL TCL and have it take place during Winter so that you maintain having Spring and Summer with Worlds in the Fall make Worlds more of a global tourney like the World Cup and guaruntee 7 spots for the top team in all the small regions and make All Stars weighted again like it was in Season 3 where your placing provided either a bonus spot for your region or a pass from groups who knows if its raised to 20 instead of 16 that would mean 13 spots are open for the 5 major regions so 3rd 2nd and 1st at All Stars gets 3 spots and the other 2 only get 2 youll add meaning to the off season produce more competition give the smaller leagues needed exposure and make 2 leagues for off season you could even partner up with IEM to make something happen for the teams not involved with the Champions league and your invitation to LCLW E Depends on circuits placements in the domestic leagues yes i know fatigue is a thing but you can give them extra incentive for the LCLW E by doing crowdfunding for those leagues n not putting a cap on what can be earned
again another team disbands Honestly this is starting to become a worrying trend its kinda sad how teams in esports are so easily destroyed due to players leaving disbanding No team is safe No fan are safe that s why you cannot take eSports serious The only legit teams are TSM FNC SKT and C9
For some reason you chose to leave out CLG DIG TL
It s only the first wawe investor teams that are selling the established orgs are staying though SK might be done with LoL
It s actually a good trend IMO the ones that are billing out are the ones who can no longer compete with the paychecks NRG and IMT are good for the industry in the long run
In today s episode of the Daily No Shit
RIP EU LCS lol
Riot should just desolve the EU LCS and absorb the top 6 teams into the NA LCS and kick the bottom 4 teams out This will give us 12 top tier teams better matches and matches only on the weekend Everyone wins Except those bottom 4 in each region they d be screwed But at least Challenger series would be exciting again
No If they want to dissolve a LCS it shouldn t be the 2nd strongest regionLooks like two new masteries added in today s update but aren t on the tree yet Assassin Deal 1 5 increased damage when no allied champions are nearby Murderous Intent Deal 5 increased damage to champions until you gain a kill or assist
But not good enough
15 damage on 1000 damage if you get to that much So gooooooood
1 5 is not significant enough for him to be meta His problems are far too great still
why does reddit thinks that for something to be good it HAS to be meta like seriously saying X is better than Y doesnt make Y bad
Because in most cases in homogenous classes if you re not the best there s usually little reason to pick the champ ADCs before the rework and a ton of assassins occupy the same space Why pick X champ when Y champ does everything that X does but with less drawbacks Its not necessarily about being meta but rather bringing something unique so that you re actually a consideration
the meta only matters when you can play those metachamps at the same level as other champs
That s the assumption You have to compare things in a vacuum Like if you compare an equally skilled Rengar player to an equally skilled Khazix player most of the time the Rengar player will get more done Its the same for something like Yasuo over Zed
But where do they put it on the tree
We Christmas decorating now
I m just gonna assume that you re comment is setting up a karma train and jump on because that shit was genius Unfortunately Kha zix has trouble decorating with his claws so obviously it ll end up somewhere terrible on the tree for him
They both sound quite similar to bounty hunter and oppressor Maybe they ll be replacing those two
It s just make the strongest Assassin aka rengar even more stronger Riot need buff the champ himself and not around
It s a I want to get first blood mastery Once someone like riven gets first blood I think she is ok with losing a mastery point
It s honestly really strong for snowballers
It sounds ridiculous on Draven EDIT Draaaven
Drav n Draven s brother with fabulously long blonde hair and a swedish accent
Ty for the edit Dr Aven will be grateful
I can t believe people think this mastery is bad it s incredibly strong on champs that snowball from a First Blood
Strong on any lane bully I think Renekton Riven Swain Cait Brand and many more champs would seriously benefit from this
I m guessing it will be quite low in one of the mastery trees Something like tier 2 of cunning Just a little bit of something to try and help you snowball
it seems pretty amazing for champs who can take off with a 1 kill lead Pretty much any assassin stuff like riven fiora or irelia even someone like draven
yup red pots back and this time it won t cost you 350 gold XD
A good strategy is feeding hard so that nobody can get a kill around you then win at lategame with your 5 extra damage Source I have a PhD in Mastery appreciation
I guess it will go on cd when you get kill assist
I m pretty sure it will go away completely And it s strong as it is It s an early snowball mastery that helps you to get started
thats what I was thinking
Might be good on supports that harass in lane Like Thresh or Morg
Draven buff Let me just stack to a few hundred and kill someone By that time I ll have a lot of gold anyways so 5 bonus damage coupled with Q amplification is dumb Draven will also kill people level 1 again with this mastery
I m imagining taking it on lane bullies and just pushing people out of lane all day You have 5 health You really want to stick around Go ahead and recall while I keep farming
They already do that 5 isn t too much besides the ol lane bullies are kinda in a bad spot right now because tank masteries are too good It was made for them to snowball with
Seems like it from the description Although I sincerely doubt if it is ever worth using
Seriously boss let us rough u coreylulu up a little bit teach him a lesson
Reddit frowns upon posting your own content too often and recommend only doing it onces for every 10 submissions He would be well over that if he submitted his own PBE patch notes
u corylulu
It s u corylulu not u coreylulu
can we have a screenshot where they are in the tree
its been like that for at least the last 5 patches that s just a tooltip change I climbed from d5 to d3 with rumble jungle but it s completely garbage this season runeglaive less ap and costs 400 more and zhonyas less armour and costs 500 more rylais liandrys cost 200 more each also his build is just so expensive now and he feels rly weak because of it and not just jungle
Yep Just a tooltip fix damage is exactly the same on PBE vs Live
The only problem I see about him being in the jungle is that just like fiddlesticks runeglaive is far from a good item to buy on him IMO which I find very sad since he looks like alot of fun in the jungle
Devourer rageblade nashors Overheat your way to victory
And he s quite good in the jungle if this change is true
He s always had a healthy clear with Q for AoE and W for sustain and he can really take advantage of overheating His ganks are ok brings damage but only brings soft CC If he gets counterjungled by an early game duelist he can get wrecked Nonetheless this change will really bump his clear speed up dramatically
Tested myself alone and I ve cleared every jungle camp with machete and i had like half of my health He s pretty good now
I ve been jungling with Rumble since last season and he is quite decent at it especially when magus was around The mana regen aoe sustain item will give you better results than machete for early game if you don t run attack speed runes
Nid buffs a couple months ago we d have the pitchforks out and full screaming What a time
Funny how they buff her spear the most annoying part of her kit to enemies and nerf her pounce which is telegraphed and puts her in harms way Doesn t really make sense Edit revert her pounce buff
They don t nerf pounce They just reverted a PBE buff on Pounce
I was sad when they removed the pounce damage but increased spear If she had that pounce she d have an even more insane and healthier clear Stacking traps in a line before monsters spawn free pounces
But 1 shotting carries was fun
The late damage stays the same so they basically just revert some of the early game spear damage nerfs Late game the nerf didn t matter anyway Shit buff would prefer the pounce buff instead
They only buffed early levels on spear Max level damage still the same at 130
The spear buff is just to help her clear I think 20 damage level one are not that big of a deal on the skill she s going to max anyway
I just wish Riot would stop listening to backlash and grow a pair with balancing for once They wanted Nid to focus on Human to Proc Cougar to fight yet here they are still buffing the Javelin damage It s just like how they wanted to mini rework Lee and with pretty much the same playstyle people flipped their shit Before that was the Katarina rework where they wanted her to be less Ultimate reliant and every single balance change for her has made her more and more ult reliant Riot please can we start doing what we said we d do with champion balancing and such I really don t want to live in fear of 1 5k damage spears on a 4s CD again
I think they want her to keep her niche as a poking champ They didn t nerf Cougar Its a revert to a previous buff A champ can t be to good at everything so they have to decide where to take power from to stuff it into spears
That s the thing though Riot wanted to move Nidalee from purely poke to a poke and brawl playstyle when they gave her that rework a ways back Their explicit design intentions was for her Human form to proc The Hunt with slightly lowered damage and for her Cougar form to capitalize and do the real fighting If Nid is having trouble in the jungle clearing which is what an early damage buff would imply why not buff the form she spends most of her time clearing the jungle with Every buff to Javelin no matter how small pushes Nid one step closer to her old 1 5k 4s spears from hell and nobody wants that
Yeah but one step is not a leap like you imply Small buffs don t have to push her overboard and she won t like old nid
The max rank damage is the same they just reverted it for the early levels As far as I m concerned that change is completely okay
To be completely fair that Katarina rework was an absolute atrocity It removed all damage on E nerfed Q damage on throw but buffed on hit and made W ratio based on total AD They wanted her to build hybrid AD while still having her kit based around her need to use abilities and channel ult meaning that virtually no build would give katarina maximum effectiveness because you need to build AD with new scalings and new q but the kit punishes you for E ing because of how you can t shunpo to the same target twice It was just all around poorly done and I still don t think kat needs a rework nonetheless When Tiensi himself says the rework is bad with all his experience on kat I think it should be noted that it was questionable at BEST
The rework was a good idea I repeat a good idea but it s been handled like absolute shit ever since The idea of making Kat less ult reliant was sorely needed but goddamn don t make every single buff she ever received after the rework go towards her Ult with the nerfs to her baseline abilities New gunblade at least feels really really good on her now I guess that s something
Are you talking about the 2012 rework or the 2015 proposed rework because I was talking about the 2015 one
And malzahar nerds I m so confused right now
Nidalee buffs Poppy splash art as a desktop background am i even playing the same game
New Zhonya s VFX
WHERE S MY GIANT LOW FPS RING RIOT
literally just bard ult finally tho
Jesus at last that effect was the crappiest looking thing ever now it looks great Just wish it was as solid gold looking as the old one it looks more like a veil in the new VFX
I hate that sound effect Where s the kick at the start It just quietly fades in
To be fair that kick is the sound of clicking an item It was never actually part of the Zhonya s audio
oooh that s fancy
Shame on you that flair and did not try it on soraka Seriously though try it I want to see if she still has a special zhonya EDIT holy shit it was fixed in 5 13 Rip
Nid buffs and malz nerfs What season is this
4672
Buff to Thunderlord s Decree after already everyone and their mother started using it Interesting
and the tooltip says gives 10 ap while it gives 20 dont be suprised if you see it 30 next patch and tooltip stays 10
It actually has a 10 AP ratio The in game ratio says otherwise but the damage is actually calculated with the 10 ratio At least thats what a Rioter told me
Also there is a fervor nerf on pbe only stacks on champion I welcome our thunderoverlords
I don t understand it The stacks don t even last enough to just continue stacking until ten because in lane you re barely stacking it
Thunderlord s Decree Bonus AD ratio increased to 30 from 20 Jayce mains come Unite
the ratio was never 20 its bugged with AP its the opposite this moment its 10 AD 20 AP the tool tip is bugged or just the of ad ap
Still they rlly could buff the AP ratio too 3
Thunderlord s Decree is the way to go on AP s I dont see why they need any reason to buff it for AP s
Lol Malz nerf I like how Riot works with nerfs though Quinn is such a good example Why tone down the skill a little when you can nerf it in almost every way possible I m surprised they didn t throw a range nerf on it as well for shits and giggles
Fun Fact The last time Malzahar was nerfed was in patch V1 0 0 120 which was released on June 22 2011 Since then he has recieved nothing but bug fixes and buffs
I may be a bit biased as a former Malzahar main but he s been pretty damn balanced He can drop a LOT of damage fast but he has no mobility it s all over time and half of it is cleanseable giving him a large chunk of counterplay Hell a lot of the frustration with fighting Malz is that you just never see him played anywhere The surprise factor of WTF Why does this fucking hurt gets a lot of them Though to be fair that HP damage really could stand those nerfs and still be just as effective especially when you have enough AP that it s ticking for 15 20 Max HP per second for 5 seconds
He s consistently had high win rates and is pretty hard to zone because he can drop two skills and then stand clear while the wave farms itself
Malz has a dedicated playerbase which inflates his winrates It s just like how LB has lower winrates because EVERYONE wants to play an assassin and just kill whatever moves The tank juggernaught metas have also been kind to him since he excels at stopping a lone dive and shredding a tankline s health Malz isn t the only champion that has an incredibly safe laning phase And he s incredibly susceptible to 2v1s thanks to immobility and lack of raw burst He has to focus someone down or he gets nothing Malz is strong don t get me wrong When you can 100 0 an ulting Mundo in 1 rotation you re strong But he s that weird balanced strong where there s a lot you can do to beat it both in and outside of the game It s not like ADCs in an assassin meta where they just blow you up It s not like Brand right now where he just outbullies you Malz will make laning hell and then try to either remove soemone from the game every fight or more importantly keep his ADC alive with his massive single target DoT suppression a super peel
True And to be fair Talon definitely has highs and lows as meta shifts and items change League of Cleavers Talon would rip you apart League of Warmogs RIP Talon The fact that he actually has lower single target burst than other assassins probably does miracles for Talon to keep people from complaining about him
Yeah Malzahar is one of the best 1v1ers in the game His team fighting relies on his q and e and any one brave enough to dive with get their health shred
Maybe because most Malzahar players are mains and a lot of mains know their champ well Most noob malazahrs dont know how to combo well and use their ult in the wrong moments the thing is malzahar punishes players out of position and gets punished the same as well you gotta know how to position well with Malzahar or you will die If Malzahar doesn t land his combo silence the enemy or make good use of his w and ult then he can t do shit Edit Also the QSS buffs fucked him up
He gets high win rates because most people who play him are experienced
He s also had few major counters in lane ever since LB got her silence taken away You can somewhat safely pick Malz into just about any matchup and still survive lane He s a safe pick
Both If you add up 3 dots together it does a lot of damage fast but its still over time
They do DoT mage and fast damage aren t mutually exclusive you know Cassiopeia does a LOT of damage really fast But you wouldn t call it burst you d call it over time Same with Malzahar His DoTs hurt no doubt But it s not a slow burn like Swain it s a fast burn like Cass He s designed to kill in the duration of his ultimate 2 5s not to just burst from 3 spells and leave
That Malz nerf is less impactful than you think it is You typically max W last and early damage is unchanged so that nerf won t be seen until you reach late game a state where Malz is already weaker If they re gonna nerf him this is the way to do it
Maxing W second is quite strong though against all these tanks Even champion gg says it has a higher winrate than Q second Probably depends on playstyle though Like I don t even buy a RoA so I get an earlier damage spike with higher AP items and I don t even use my Q to poke just to silence if needed Basically I just stand at the backline and wait for their frontline to engage then melt him so it becames a 5v4 This nerf makes Malz lose 10 max hp on his W thats like ridiculous for someone like me
As a fellow long time Malzahar main I guess I d have to agree that it s the least obnoxious nerf they could make Still against a tanky target it works out to a nerf of anywhere from 200 300 hundred points of damage after magic resistance assuming full duration which almost never happens in big lategame teamfights where CC the Malzahar is everybody s favorite game But I agree that this nerf won t really be felt until 25 minutes into the game since it only affects later ranks It does however push Malzahar a little further away from his niche role as a mage who can actually tank bust which is unfortunate given how much play Mundo is seeing right now Yes his Q remains by far his strongest lategame skill but this nerf makes it less risky for tanky initiators to dive straight at him Much like my other main Fiddlesticks who was recently gutted I actually wasn t aware that Malzahar needed to be nerfed It seems that his greatest crime is having a high win rate which is a natural byproduct of having a devoted playerbase
It s due to the new masteries that actually give him some good damage increase Overall the nerf is pointless unless you re doing a ult combo with it which doesn t happen too often in teamfights
I suppose it would be too reasonable to point out Riot s remarks about preseason being a time for experimentation with the new masteries and suggest that they tweak any problematic masteries before directly tinkering with champions
With regards to the Quinn nerfs the skill is going to keep all its utility with a slightly higher mana cost The nerfs might not be as heavy handed as they look
They re not Quinn s damage comes off of her valor mark procs and once you build ER there s no need to worry about mana cost its a Nerf to her oppressive early game in lane which as an ADC main is rediculous You cannot lose trades If you play Quinn right in lane now
Lets be honest dude Malz is strong as fuck I ve never seen my teammates survive through lane against him and in the end the nerf isn t going to hurt
oh boy Rumble in the jungle inc edit wtf thunderlords buffs
to ads
The day has come the best lore in game is no more
RIP Whomper RIP Blomgrun
All hail Blomgrum
Blomgrum is our Lord and Saviour Probably Ao Shin will be reworked into Blomgrum the Almighty Destroyer
Before anyone loses their shit keep in mind that these short lore entries are client only we ll most likely see a much longer lore entry for Poppy when her rework is released
too late RITO LORE DARK MYSTERIOUS PAST ETC BLAH BLAH YADDA YADDA SHITPOSTING LOUDLY
Thank god Anivia nerfs reverted
usually when they revert nerfs is only because they are thinking of something different it would be ridicolous if TF will receive nerfs and Anivia won t and I m saying that as a happy Anivia abuser
But those nerfs were way to hard 1 sec less time to proc your e If you got bad luck they walk out of your ult you e they flash away and the ability procs more then a second later so no crit In comparison are the tf s nerfs only minor stuff And they both buffed and nerfed the early and late game at the same time
They nerfed TF S first maxed ability and Ulti range hard How is that minor stuff
TF ult being buffed at rank 3 is a joke He ll get so hurt by the nerfed range at rank 1 and 2 and that 500 extra range at rank 3 is beyond useless compared to that Anivia nerfs weren t that bad imo also considering it s a while she s being very strong
Her ult range breaks at 1000 units instead of 1200 units still though
R U M B L E I N T H E J U N G L E
Cya later quinn
Homestart This unit has greatly increased Movement Speed Teleporting removes this speed Is this referring to the new 20 minute homeguard If so wow what a lame nerf
Seeing as it s called Homestart i think it s more so for the start of the game to make it different from the homeguard
I think it s just the speed buff we have when we spawn it would be sucha massive nerf if it was on 20 minutes homeguards rip heca rip kennen rip rammus
I wonder if they plan on re adding homeguards as an enchantment while keeping homestart as what champs get now with some stat changes of course
Thatd only make sense considering homefuards were core on sone champs
No more tp to turret Homestart invade then
I don t think Assassin is going to help kha very much
The source on Anivia s Q R revert is a tweet about sion burning down a forest Cool
Time for people to complain about Quinn nerfs even though she desperately needs them
She needs nerfs not being gutted This is the first time she s even been remotely viable at a competitive level Right now her Q is going to go from godlike to trash tier People just want a happy medium between the two
It s still a 2 second disable that gets down to a 4 2 second cooldown Her performance is absolutely absurd right now It will take more than this to gut her
God tier to trash lol not even close buddy Why do people overreact to tiny nerfs such as this one
I don t mind the Q changes because it really is doing way too much damage for how strong the utility is and how low the cooldown is on that utility But the base damage nerf is sad because it ll make her jungle clear noticeably worse
Nerfing multiple parts of her main ability is NOT the way to go about it
Time to bring out the ol jungle Rumble
Skarners Passive Nerf is still there
So few people still play him so Riot s just trying to sweep him under the rug until they can figure out what they want to do with him Again
Waiting on one of the TF nerfs to be reverted
Malz nerfs What
That malzahar nerf
Hmm
They finally got to Malzahar after all this time Damn you Deathfire Touch
Nidalee buff is just because her early clear sucks so much dick
Not for Rush tho
There is absolutely nothing wrong with her clear at any phase of the game you have 0 idea what you re talking about
It probably has something to do with that 38 win rate she has
Nid has lots of problems but unhealthy clears is not one of them Especially since the last patch nerfed jungle mr and red buff movement speed
Meanwhile brand points and clicks you for half your hp level 1
Surely 20 mana will solve that s
Deathfire touch was heavily nerfed though His dmage should be much lowee next patch
If these Quinn changes go through they ll be her very first set of nerfs since release how exciting
and they don t look too gutting just a light power shaving from her laning harass which she desperately needed
I like how the thread above this is saying how this will gut her and that s she s already useless lategame Either these guys don t play Quinn or suck on Quinn
Actually her winrate takes a dive after 35 mins She s not useless late but her job becomes a lot harder
Homestart This unit has greatly increased Movement Speed Teleporting removes this speed Hmm will this be like the bonus movement speed you get from when you start the game and will it be from 0 to 20 min
seeing it says start probably means is only the speed you get at the begining of the game
its me or thunderlord still bugged it says it gives 20 of your ad ratio but it gives 10 says 10 ap but gives 20
Its bugged i would rlly be glad if they would make it 30 20 Ad Ap ratio 3
I dont like these masteries mostly because it means some of the current ones will be gone
I don t think that s the right way to buff Nida Riot should consider reverting previous nerfs to her kit W vision and Q delay and try to add less raw power And I hate the fact that they only look at her jungle role when balancing her I wish they would revert her passive procing on jungle creeps and give us our laning nidalee back
The change I would love to see going with the actual theme would be able to proc Spellblade with spear smaller scaling on range That would allow jungle and lane nid to have much more strategic decision making
Whaaat They did not even touch lane Nidalee She s been viable in every sense including laning ever since they made cougar accessible at level 1 instead of 6 They even said in one of the patch notes a long time ago that the jungle change wasn t exclusively to turn her into a jungler and that lane Nidalee could also use the change to do side camps or blue buff faster
nidalee in lane is not that good anymore not viable for compatitive especialy after the hp nerfs and folow nerfs they did more or less force her to jungle
Still hoping they revert the unit collision nerf on Hecarim Honestly I can think of 20 different ways I d rather have him nerfed that ll remove so much of the fun of playing him Creep block for days
Keep in mind that the homestart nerf mentioned is not the same as homeguard If u moobeat could confirm I m pretty sure it s the initial speed boost you get at the beginning of the game A nerf to the already slower homeguards would be silly
No Tahm Kench changes yet damn
M M Malzahar nerfs But he s so immobile and so exploitable Don t make it harder for me to kill Mundo and Malphite please
Still waiting for Kha zix buffs
When that day comes Khalex Ich will show NA True fear
Why the Malz nerfs didn t Riot say they were trying to push him to PLAYABILITY
ah the yearly rumble jungle patch wonder why they are doing this this time around they already introduced it twice and got rid of it the patch after in both cases
Would rather have had the pounce buff than the spear buff better for jungle clear
If you know how to clear the jungle there s literally nothing wrong with the speed
Is rumble jungle inc
RIP Blomgrun
Does baron have a santa hat like last year I HAVEN T SEEN ANY POST ABOUT IT
Oh look more thunderlord buffs It was already crazy strong before any changes
Rumble in the jungle calling it now
Riot better nerf the bird still too strong for little work
I read poppy s quote in Solid Snake s voice Sounded so legit in my head
Zed is already retarded with the Thunderlord mastery now they increase the AD ratio on it Time to permaban zed again

Thank you Mr bot
bleep bloop
Stinger Akali Frozen Shen Swamp Master Kennen All Have the same picture as Imperial Lux Thanks for the list
No poro rider sejuani
Where s that Kog main that had all the skins except Sonoran
I think he got it already it came out in a pack little bit ago
How he regrets spending so much now that it will be on sale
Ha I was just thinking of that guy
They actually were able to get it in a Void skin bundle that came out earlier
Ahri called challenger again
The name was changed in the PBE so in live was always challenger
Noxus Poppy I will destroy you the League of Legends champion skin What a time to be alive
I d like to have a moment of silence for my bank account
EXILED MORG
Just a reminder Many of the legendary skins are not on par with the more current ones make sure you check them out before buying if you aren t sure what you re getting Many have no new particle effects and any created before Gentleman Cho don t even have new voiceovers Obviously this is a really low price but make sure you know that these aren t really comparable to Brolaf or Dragon Trainer Trist
Alien Invader Donger is worth just for the reference alone The free Mystery gift is just icing on the cake
You don t get a skin if you buy the skin it needs to be gifted irc
If you acquire a Legendary skin in any way while the Legendary Snowball is going on you get a Mystery Gift This includes self bought and gifted skins
Nunu bot not on sale damn Rito must really value the laugh
Nunu bot isn t a legacy skin so it won t be on sale here no It may be on sale in the snowdown store though but we don t have enough details on how that will work yet
HOLY moly I just went to look up Brolaf and Nunu Bot in the shop since I wasn t sure if they are buyable or not and realized I actually even own Nunu Bot o O I m pretty sure it was a Mystery Gift but I just can t remember Too bad he s so out of meta right now
Nunu may be out of meta but that laugh makes playing him worth it H4H4H4H4H4H4
My 1720 RP will soon become 0 after this
more like 17200
I wish
REST IN FUCKING PIECES WALLET
deleted
It s not that great of a skin IMO
It s a very pretty one I would only choose it because it s a serious one that looks like she s gonna go at battle Midnight Ahri is another good one
Ahri main probably he probably wanted all of Ahri s skins
When did prom queen Annie become legacy
As a part of this event from earlier in the year
what about noxus hunter anivia
Thanks for the info
What about Ragdoll Poppy Pls Rito it s the only one I need
She s guaranteed to be in a Bundle probably not available for single sale Unless you get lucky with a personalized shop sale
All show skins are able to be individually purchased according to u WizardCrab
All Poppy skins will be released on the store once her VU hits live for a certain amount of time
what do I have to do to get all star akali everytime I see a legacy skin sale I search for her but to no avail the pain
iirc that skin comes out during the world cup every 4 years along with the other world cup skins if I am thinking of the right skin
looks like im waiting 3 years until i can complete my akali collection
Maybe just maybe they will also put her on sale for the Euro 2016 cup We can only hope my friend
She s only on sale every time there s a World Cup so wait a few more years Sorry
rip all of my waifu dreams
Tear fully stacked 750 750
ANGLER JAX HYPEEEE
Will these come out tomorrow
As mentioned in the title this promotion lasts December 16th through Jan 7th
Will we get a mystery box by buying a legendary skin on sale
For the few legacy legendary skin sales that overlap dates yes
Thanks Now I don t know if I should wait for a better looking TF skin or just get this one because of the mystery box
I m sad firefighter trist is coming back out again I have it and I always felt special because nobody else had it
I can t decide on the firefighter or dragon trainer
Wohoo first snowdown for me My wallet is ready
no Bad santa veigar
I assume all the legacy Snowdown skins will also be returning for the duration of the event be it in single or in bundles
You think this includes Silent Night Sona Or is that skin different
Yep she ll be back in the shop for purchase
Do you know if that skin ll be for sale individually or is it a bundle thing I m sorry to keep asking so many questions
Yes Silent Night Sona will be available for individual purchase
WOOHOO You just made my day thank you so much
I got it from mystery gift couple of weeks ago I dont like it wish I could give it to you
I know he s available in a bundle not sure about by himself though
Time to grab that legendary corki skin and annie also 3
Recon or Badger Teeomo
I prefer badger
Holy cow all of those legendary skins are half price Good time to get that TF skin I ve been eye balling
Be warned its not so magnificent
Which tf skin do you recommend Edit But the TF skin is 1820 which means we get a mystery box for free
Underworld i think is the best
Underworld and Cutpurse are the two best for the price Underworld has voice processing custom cards on W and custom particles on all of his spells attacks Cutpurse has custom cards on his W and is only 750 Plus no hat making it unique
Nice info thanks Will just save for when Cutpurse TF is on sale then
I think Underworld is not an option
I use underworld But it s a little bit late for that
RIP me
Does anyone know the dates that the recent skins are going to be going on sale I want to get Dragon Trainer Lulu
Do you mean tristana
No
Defender or iron Solari Leona
Iron Solari IMO
Ye I like that one more too but Defender is cheaper and legacy Ew will probably end up getting Iron Solari on sale
Iron Solari is better cause the ult alone let alone a better look overall
True And Iron solari vs Pool Party
Tough choice I have both and btw Project is 1 and would say it comes down to personal preference Solari emphasizes her badass tanky character while Pool Party is a bit more light hearted and demure Pool party also has the recall animation and the parasol zenith blade I stuck with Solari cause personal pref and then Project cause it s a similar style but fancier All things considered she has a good line of skins to choose from
I like Defender because it looks tankier
pool party obviously 8
Lollipoppy
I need second Ahri skin right RIGHT
RIP my fucking Scooby Doo wallet
Challenger Ahri D
where is lollipoppy i cant find her
Lollipoppy is a Harrowing Legacy skin and was just on sale Nov 5th 16th
HEXTECH SION FUCK YES
Ctrl F Nunu Sasquatch Nunu Gee the only nunu skin I own and its on sale GIVE ME NUNU BOT SALE RITO
my wallet is crying
Winged or Viscero Xin
As an Ahri main half price Challenger Ahri pleases me 3
woo Phantom Karthus
RemindMe 24 days
Finally i can buy challenger Ahri The only skin im missing on all my 6 accounts
Welp now I m not sure to get what skin for vayne and xin now Should I get archlight or vindactor vayne Should I get Winged Hussar Secret Agent or Viscero Xin Zhao I m leaning towards the legacy skins cause they are legacy but the new ones look pretty dam nice as well
Ayyy I had swampmaster kennen on my main many years ago but I was a toxic kid so I got permabanned and lost Championship Riven all my legacy skins well deserved And I didn t buy it the last chances I had so I m glad to see the legacy vault opening up
why are blood moon kali high noon yas never on sale
Kalista has only been out for roughly a year so it s no surprise her Blood Moon skins hasn t gone on sale yet It should be on sale within a month or two Riot doesn t like to let skins sit over a year without selling
They are not legacy skins Also I am pretty sure high noon yasou was on sale in the last 2 months
i guess but they are never on sale even in the regular weekly sales so idk
High Noon Yasuo was last sold January 15th so yeah it s kinda been awhile since he rolled around Just hold onto some RP he should roll around sooner or later not many skins go more than a year without selling again
If you look at the champion sales page on the league wiki there s a link to a sales prediction spreadsheet My experience had been that it s surprisingly accurate I would check it out High Noon Yasuo should be on sale around March 2016 if I m not mistaken that s one I ve been waiting for too P
the prediction only goes up to 2014 its in the league forums right
I think that must be a different one the one I ve been checking is usually up to date on sales within a few days of them happening or so I m on mobile but I ll try to find it and post a link
Here s a link to the wiki http leagueoflegends wikia com wiki League of Legends Wiki Sale At the bottom of the page there s a related links section the spreadsheet is called champion sales prediction spreadsheet or something like that This one is up to date
3 Annie skins I love you Rito
Idk why but every time I see one of these I Ctrl F and type Championship Riven but am always let down
Get super drunk for the next world s pick em and choose then Probably your best shot at winning
Riot Legacy skins Riot We ll bring them back every month Riot
LOL CHALLENGER AHRI FOR 480 RP SAY WHAT
What its 487 Rp
Hm i remember some of the old skins getting a certain border for being legacy skins when they came back will new legacy skins such as the certain snow skins Sivir Lulu or Challenger Ahri be getting the same Edit Thanks for the answers everyone
probably not the borders were for the OG Limited skins not the newly Legacy You know skins that were promised to never return as compared to the ones that can return whenever Riot feels like
Ah makes sense thanks
Nope that promotion was for limited skins transitioning to legacy skins
deleted
You get the boarder IF you had the skin BEFORE the event
Ik this is fairly selfish of me but man I loved only the old player based on had these legacy skins shows how dedicated they are But now it seems to be none of these semi rare skins
So Um Did we have a harrowing event beyond a few walls of text Not that this isn t neat and all Just the explanation that the harrowing can occur on another date just made me think they delayed it by a bit not decided to just forgo letting me buy lollipoppy now that I know we get a rework soon
Whhaaattt thhee ffuuucckk No Reaper Soraka Fml
Yeah I immediately ctrl F d Reaper Soraka too
Am I the only one that thought firefighter trist was degraded to a 1350 skin and as such should bot be treated like a 1820 skin any moretfw your esports career becomes a meme
Link was actually one of the best American midlaners ever IMO it s a shame he ll only be remembered for the donezo manifesto
He could have been a lot greater but his dedication faltered at points and he was inconsistent
That s true but I am having a hard time thinking of 5 NA midlaners that were better than Link Care to help me
Reginald hai pobelterish Uhh Dade and faker boom NA talent baby WOO
Are you guys memeing or just dumb as bricks Mancloud bigfatlp pobelter shiptur scarra
I d replace Shiptur with Regi
and id call you mad for saying a guy who went 3 years trying to learn tf is a top 5 Na midlaner
Regi was one of the best NA mid laners during his time and played extremely well when subbing in for Bjerg
you re right 3 gp10 items tf was a god build and i know nothing about the game i started playing since late s1 I swear ill never find out where this new regi was one of the best NA mids s2 came from cause i dont remember anyone back then saying that I remember people saying bigfat was the best coming out of season1 and scarra being the best NA in season 2 But lord knows every since a couple months ago or so 1 year old accounts have been telling me Regi was a god in s2
Not everyone can play every champion
Shiphtur mancloud are debatable just for longevity s sake I didnt know enough about scarra to put him on the list but some of those are pretty accurate and I was just too tired bricks to really think
MandatoryCloud had been around since like Season 1 and his peak was far higher than Link s IMO
Shiphtur is debatable mancloud is not There was a period in like season 3 where mancloud and xmithie were a pretty fucking terrifying pair Scarra also definitely better than Link
I don t know about Scarra He fell off pretty hard once LCS started Season 2 Scarra was regarded as the best mid laner in NA at one point I feel that Link is debatable in the top 5 but I wouldn t fault anyone who thought so NA was never really known for having the best mid laners in the world NA had pretty great ADCs however throughout the years with Doublelift and Chaox representing the old school
Shiphtur comparison aside I have a serious question What has Link ever done to be considered one of the best NA mids He played on CLG sure but CLG didn t win anything during that time Link would get outfarmed every single game and have less impact on fights I m sure I m wrong about this but I don t remember a single period of Link s career where he was above average Mancloud jiji pobelter scarra reginald hai voyboy they ve all had periods where they were individually top tier and for most of their careers had some elite aspect of their play What does Link have other than being consistently mediocre
If you take a look at Mancloud before he was in XDG he held the LCS record for kills
Mancloud and Scarra should 100 be on the list but Shiphtur Hmmm I d say no
Seriously Shiphtur and Hai were the only mid laners from NA competing with Bjergsen and not getting absolutely dumpstered when Bjerg first came to NA
Same with shiphtur too IMO I don t think like ever had a split as good as shiphtur did in s4 spring
even if you do count for longevity mancloud was a fucking beast in season 3 and is definitely worthy to mention
Ok I ll give you that much
Not even close to debatable Link was never considered a top talent in NA other than before season 3 when he was highly regarded as a solo Q god
Scarra Mancloud Bigfatlp Hai Reginald
This might be the closest but Mancloud was good for how long 1 split I m not too sold on Scarra too but that may be because when I got into league he was already past his prime
Mancloud was a thing before LCS since you weren t around
Part of Season 1 all of season 2 all of season 3
In no order it s probably Regi Mancloud bigfat Hai and Scarra Link
POB Mancloud
Na born or na players
Born
Scarra mancloud and hai were all better S2 and S3 I m pretty sure jiji was as well in season 2
Honestly it s probably just Regi Hai and Jiji
Those are the obvious 3 mechanical skill I d say Pobelter Shiphtur and Mancloud were are better though
Pobelter Bjergsen Alex Ich GBM and Froggen
4 out of 5 are not really American midlaners
removed
Why do people have to be so idiotic out of nowhere Aren t there 2 interpretations possible from the question
he was obviously joking about NA having bad mids
Not so obvious to me sorry if that offends you
WITH NA MONEY THEY ARE
He could ve been so much better if he didn t have the attitude he showed in his donezo manifesto Like if CLG is a terrible environment why not join another team He was strong enough for it
I remember when c9 borrowed link and went 3 1 in group stages of All Star 2014 over OMG FNC and TPA losing only to SKT They had like what a week of practice together
A month
Not at all LOL Damn nostalgia makes redditors so delusional
I agree I rated him above Bjergsen admittedly with bias probably for one split Can t remember which one
What the hell
NA born or NA LCS If the former that s not saying much P
Roommates
I miss these guys Benny is such a likable guy

Saving this thanks
Lyricism at its finest
Oh god I forgot about that Thanks my life was happier before your reminded me
It s not me blame u Felekin
definitely wasn t me
definitely not blitzcrank
Adding him to the ignore list That should be enough
Shh bby is ok
Nice meme
But what about the NA talent Aren t they going to be given a chance frankly if the rumors are true and that Froggen and now perhaps Coco could go to NA though I highly doubt it then it s a dark day for young Americans indeed What s the point of even trying to get into the LCS not surprised Yusui called it a day and where is Rhux
Rhux has had loads of chances he obviously isn t good enough Yusui is a weird one really hyped up yet seemingly isn t willing to stick it out with a challenger team I hope the rumor about every LCS team being forced to have a B team for developing talent is true that would help a lot Short term players like Coco Froggen GBM etc coming in is awful for NA talent but I see it as a good thing long term NA talent will be able to play against them in solo q scrims every day and it ll raise their level
Yusui decided it wasn t worth the stress and just called it quits Probably a smart move on his part
He returned to the game and he wants to get back into competitive in a couple months
Yeah that s what I heard
NA talent is protected so we dont have an issue like Start Craft 2 The main issue is NA talent and numbers are to low to be a power house
The Taiwan League has a lower population and puts out decent teams I don t think it s entirely the fact NA has a low population server It s just easier to import instead of develop talent
or lower Froggen Coco GBM level of play I don t think the presence of a few impressive players who work hard even in solo q is enough to offset the large number of 1 trick pony gimmicky streamers in NA being the more present solo q players Until enough of the actual talent is willing to play often and seriously enough that less rounded players can t get into challenger so consistently the NA scene is going to have trouble
Lower Froggen s level of play Did you see Elements Just about any team would be an upgrade
We were speaking in regards to solo q or at least I was
I disagree Rhux was never given a chance he was always pushed from pillar to post and in fact he was one of the original victims of the foreign imports Remember he got replaced by Edward in Curse before he could get settled Flash forward to 2014 Goldenglue and himself got replaced in Team Coast for Miracle and Ringer Do you know who they are because I don t Put it this way 2 seasons from now there may not even be Na players in the Na Lcs Especially if the current crop of imports stick around to get declare their region as Na etc This is the thing maybe one or two players might benefit from playing against these players but let s stop overestimating how many that will benefit I want their to be a genuine international tournament the best Na players Vs the best Eu players Vs the best Chinese players Vs the best Korean players They should do that for all stars instead
Watching these off season challenger tournaments really makes me wish teams would try and foster talent It s not like NA is void of talent
i mean if it is 2nd tier mid laners taking spots from NA players yeah it sucks But it s coco
https youtu be 9Uc3V8NxKWw t 36s
Wait if CoCo goes to a foreign league who the fuck is gonna compete with faker if not CoCo and GBM Easyhoon better stay in Korea
Please not NA again seeing Coco retire after being stuck in CJ prison will be so sad
Chinese billionaire incoming
It s getting harder to be a CJ fan They dont manage to keep Coco and they can t get rid of Space The dissappointment is way too big right now
I can T fucking think right now I m so sad and mad at the same time Being Azubu Frost fan since season 2 ffs They weren t like this They ve had shy and madlife they re still there they are experienced CoCo was awesome I ranked him 3rd midlaner in Korea after faker and ezHoon Well I m not like the others though once a fan always a fan
IMO Coco is better than TheHoon Hoon has his champions but Coco could everything really well
Coco is definitely better than Easyhoon I hope that he will win some titles because he deserves that An amazing midlaner
Coco is probably my favorite mid laner perhaps after Faker since it s really hard not to love Faker I mean he randomly broke into a roll while walking across the biggest stage of league of legends like it was nothing that takes some balls Hopefully Coco goes to a good team I don t know about winning titles as there are tons of individual talents that deserve it who don t get the achievement but I do hope he finds a team that pays him well and is surrounded by talent that can compete Given that he s a pretty big name I d wager he can get both of those things but at the very least some money
I think coco s azir was disgusting af significantly more polished than easyhoon
Cocos Azir matches Easyhoons Azir may even better but then Azir is one of Cocos picks while it is THE pick for ezhoon
Coco was better or at least not worse than Easyhoon
Shh bby is ok
Too meta
Source of meme plz
Here
2nd after Faker tyvm
I just feel bad for MadLife
Group hug boys
On the bright side they have one of the biggest mid lane prospects waiting in the wings Outside of Faker and maybe Rookie there is no upgrade over Coco though
I am thouroughly impressed by Space how charismatic and devious has he got to be stay on the team Does he have the upper management s family as hostages Bribes Cookies
Coco was really the only hope I had as a CJ fan Space wasn t even bad this year the real problem was jungle support synergy and no one stepping up to carry with Coco I fucking love Shy and Madlife but they re way too inconsistent
So you re an SKT fan now xD
They are keeping Space CJ has officially surpassed CLG as the biggest meme in LoL esports
It was never really a question
Was he that bad this season I saw a few games where they lost and he wasn t the sole reason but aside from that I have no clue
He was kinda OK in spring but in summer he went back to being good old Space I should probably say that I really don t think that Space is a bad player he is just average in fact he is the epitome of average
The Cop of the LCK one might say I was a big Cop fan and despite the bad rap he got here was a consistent as fuck adc for NA
Yeah kinda like Cop Space is always going to farm like an average pro adc he will out farm someone who is bad at laning but he will always get out farmed by a elite adc or just someone good at laning He will never win or lose you the game he will just kinda of be there Regardless like I said I don t think Space is horrible you just cannot contend for top 3 in the LCK for as long as you have him
CJ finished 3rd in the regular season so saying that they can t contend for top 3 in LCK with Space is a little unfair
IMO Coco was the one doing the carrying on that team If anything CJ won t contend for top 3 without Coco
Yeah I agree with that Coco was the strongest member on the team last season by a mile
those games where he pulled out draven and proceeded to cash in them fat stacks
That s less like Cop and more like pre TiP Apollo It d be hilarious if he turned out to be a king of spring this year though
Sounds like when Steelback was on Fnatic
No come on Space is mediocre but not as the level of Steelback in Fnatic Fnatic had to put 4 members bot lane just to try to carry him to midgame at MSI
Steelback was below average even Vardags outlaned him
Consistently average is not a good consistency though p
He was consistently above average both statistically and with the eye test He was usually in the 2 4 slot for the relevent statistics The circle jerk of cop is unagressive killed his brand sort of like Tony Romo with the Dallas Cowboys is labeled a choker despite still having the most 4th quarter comebacks of any QB still playing I believe he still holds this though correct me if i am wrong
What is epitome
Pretty much the perfect example or summary of average in this case
Space was good in spring because Urgot was relatively meta and his urgot is pretty good
Agreed and if you realize that they just refused Coco world class midlaner to keep Space just okay ADC That s like giving up inhibitor while they got red buff
Space was good to average this year people just like to keep the meme of Space Prison alive Madlife was the weaker of the duo for most of the year
Space was better in spring Madlife better in summer
Wait so what happend with Susiekim tweet
IDK maybe she got wrong information from the journalist she was talking to or maybe they are still thinking about Space Anything is possible rosters seem to change from day to day during the off season maybe at one point Space was out but they just couldn t find a good upgrade
This is what I got told about 30 mins ago Space will stick around until they can get a good replacement
Are they bidding for some players or at least holding tryouts or are we gonna see Space in Champions Spring
If they cant find an upgrade korea is donezo Come on its Space and CJ lost 2 years with him
Fury Samsung is presumably a free agent after Samsung signed CoreJJ Ohq was also released left Naijin Both are elite ADCs
I am just guessing but since this is CJ we are talking about it wouldn t surprise me that they just don t want to get rid of players I mean they have been holding on to their legacy players for a very very long time
Space outlasted Link That itself is a feat
I m just as sad as everyone about CoCo and Ambition But with CoCo s vacancy does that mean CJ ENTUS BDD
As far as I know CJ they will probably revive RapidStar
as jungle
Shy CloudTemplar Rapidstar Space Madlife
With Woong as the ADC sub
lol its cj prolly not
CJ PROLLY MID
The veterans can guide him and get him comfortable on stage They have a talented guy on the bench lets hope they dont fck up and release him like they did with Trick who was decent and had room to grow
Well i hope so is a great player
Hopefully BDD is a beast and now that he is eligible to play I am excited
What do they mean by coco going to the world league Does that mean he s leaving Korea
He s going to represent Earth in the Intergalactic League Championship
So you re telling me that hypothetical scenario thorin always brings up about aliens coming and wanting to play our best players has come true I always knew this day would come
You were waiting your entire life to write this comment so that i could come along and respond Username checks out
and you don t even respond you monster
And since Faker will be representing the aliens we ll get to see more CoCo vs Faker HYPE
5 Fakers for the alien team
I always knew he was a lizard
Still trapped in Space Prison
Looks like WildTurtle can t represent Mars anymore
They translated it bit weirdly but probably meant to say Coco is going to play in other league other than LCK
Yea it says Foreign league not naming a specific one tho
Does this mean SPIRIT
Now that Coco is gone I d much rather see Spirit on a team with actual prospects Probably going to the IM team with all the money people keep talking about
Well CJ does have BDD who is along with Scout and soHwan one of the most promising rookies of 2016 in Korea Also they did not mention anything about Space Shy or Madlife There might still be some up and coming prospects coming our way Although i highly doubt CJ would replace Shy or Madlife considering how many fans they draw
Cj still has Ghost for ADC as well who is consistently in upper mid challenger Interestingly Space has been inactive in soloq for 14 days
Yeah Ghost is pretty damn good if his stream is anything to go by and if Space has been inactive on soloQ for 2 weeks i think it s safe to say he s out
really good prospect vs the pretty much undisputed number 2 mid laner in Korea Seems like another incredibly terrible call by CJ At this point I almost have to assume they have no control and people leave because they get tired of the incompetent management otherwise there s no reason a team like CJ has to build another new roster with no known good players
BDD seems promising but all we ve heard so far about him is from solo queue he s unproven on a professional level I don t know what CJ are planning I hope that they have something good but losing Coco is going to be hard to deal with
Well ofcourse Losing the 2nd best mid in Korea will be a huge setback for CJ but i think BDD s talent could develop him into a really strong player that can maybe even fill Coco s shoes
One of Origen s analysts also said that he was just dumpstering xPeke in scrims and no other midlaner was able to dominate him that hard in scrims It s not much but it s still something I haven t heard a mid lane prospect being hyped this hard in a while
Hojin s chill but I still dare to hope for Spirit to Tigers
Yeah I feel like replacing Hojin would be strange as the team had such an emphasis on their relationship Just on a theoretical level having a jungler as great as Spirit on a team with Smeb and Gorilla would be sick though
Spirit Chaser or the likes of Tom are free agents So now all we have to wait for is CJ to announce Watch as their new jungler
interesting to see Ambition on Samsung I wonder whether he will switch back to mid or stay as a jungler Still dont know if he will help Samsung to become better after last split
TBH they already have crown which is quite good so making Ambition go to mid again after him practicing jungle for a year sound quite bad even so I would really like that because I like the boy
Eve is a pretty legit carry jungler Unless Eve is going elsewhere I don t see how there is much room for Ambition
I hope they keep eve in the jungle i think hes good plus hes fun to watch
So far we know that the Samsung roster is Helper Ambition and CoreJJ assuming they keep Crown and Wraith that roster really isn t that good would in the lower end of LCK
No cuvee no carry
but im in love with the Coco
CJ Nutella
CJ t0m and CJ Eazyhoon
finally someone worthy of the space prison
Honestly don t want Tom Or easyhoon tbh I d rather let BDD play
So Ambition and Coco leave no word about what happened to Space though
Ha fool Space will be in CJ forever D
Tis expected as a CJ fan unfortunately
Ambition to Samsung Interesting
Coco is probably going to China Sighhh Can pre season end already I just want to know where everyone is endinf up where
I want to see ambition mid again my favorite mid laner of all time
Where CoCo is going is not announced yet Thanks
first Jin air now this rip LCK it was a good run
RIP KT CoCo
Coco why must you hurt me this way Well time for BDD to shine
The Space Prison lives on
I guess a lot of people had a feeling Coco would leave ah well BDD hype I guess
SPACE PRISON IS STILL REAL
Not like this
Which chinese team is Coco joining then
Snake only has 1 korean soo maybe them
I d hope he would join VG and mata would goto coach since VG are using former adc as mid Snake already has a good midlaner in U who does great with not many resources Snake doesn t really need another import zzr isn t bad he definitely is looking better than beast
If Coco is really retiring that s one of the saddest things i ve seen this offseason
Lol I thought it was Piglet on the picture and I was like OMG CJ PIGLET HYPEEE Well
It would be as bad as keeping Space so it s possible still
Space still on CJ The Monte meme can continue
CoCo finally managed to escape from Space Prison
Apparently Ambition is joining SSG as jungler alongside CoreJJ and Helper I liked CoreJJ so Im pumped to see him play in Korea but Ambition as a jungle Not sure about that
You do realize that Ambition has played jungle for a year right
Yeah but would you say that his Jungle was better than his Mid
Mhmm that s a hard one He was definitely one of the best mids in the world in s2 and early s3 but ever since then he has kinda been lackluster except some carry performances on Nidalee and LeBlanc in s4 His jungle was actually half decent IMO He was a very smart jungler but kept getting caught Maybe not the best mechanics but he could improve My point is he hasn t played mid for a year and he will probably not be good at it even if he tried to Samsung also has Crown who s pretty good actually
I hope CoCo or Hoon ends up with KT
Coco was fun to watch but I am hyped to see what BDD can bring to the table provided CJ go with him It ll be interesting to see who they bring in to jungle I m not sure if they still have a jungle sub
I d imagine Coco is getting paid big bucks to go to China I wonder which team he will join
ambition to samsung lol what
I really wonder why CJ keeps sticking with space is he related to the CJ s owner or coach idgi I mean he isn t bad per se but he isn t good either
havent you seen the pic on their official page Space is out
I I didn t know what to expect I m not even suprised at this point I ll still support them but without CoCo damn 2016 will be hard
Well painfull preseason for almost all teams
KT Dade KT Fury IM Mata IM Spirit IM Easyhoon IM OhQ IM Duke it will be a good mercato Pls pls pls pls pls
They had a rough year and I hope this change will bring them success and happiness GL guys
Time for our lord bDD to shine
CJ Easyhoon incoming boys
What the fuck is happening in Korea again
CJE EasyHoon and CJE TOM
Fuck I figured we d drop Ambition which we needed to do But CoCo was literally our entire team for a lot of games Hopefully this means we can pick up Spirit and a decent mid laner
BDD baby
Is he even 17 yet No one seems to know so this is all pretty confusing
I think he s Korean age 17
why do these koreans all look so badass on these kind of photos
CJ Entus crushes my heart once again they were supposed to pay whatever Coco wanted and get Deft and Spirit cry
Agreed and if you realize that Ambition has played jungle for a year right
Lilsusie on Twitter said Space left already is he still on CJ
CJ loves being in space prison
I hope this change is good
Space s sex tape rumour is real
Dark times Sad days CJ why you hurt my soul
What is this World League that they mention Can someone explain me
Been a fan for so long but I cant take it anymore it is time to switch flairs RIP MiG
I wish CJ the best but I go where CoCo goes
This season had so much potential for us And they still manage to fuck it up Hopefully they make further changes I would like to see Spirit and OHQ on this team along with someone like Duke or possibly even Save if he can still player anywhere near his old level haven t seen his play since last season
It sais Coco joining the world league at first I thought China but then I realized CN really only has CN KR players where NA has NA EU SA KR I don t believe any cn players as of yet So could make sense for CJ to call NA the world region since it has players from most other regions imported does this team coco is coming to NA
Wow Ambition going to Samsung Org and Coco going to chase another team Good Luck to Both of them
FNC Ambition the dream
Not a big deal honestly Ambition wasn t that great as jungler and fnatic already has a shotcaller
It was a joke
Pls no
World league
wow is samsung even trying
SPACE PRISON LIVES
Just get rid of Space alreadyHey new analyst guy should we play this champ Ya he s OP lol LOCK IN
We will play the top 5 highest winrate champions of op gg every time just practice them it s simple this way we have an extra 10 chances of wining Ban strategy is to ban the 6 following ones Analyst of the year season 6
Well given how some NA and EU teams have played in this past year you d think that this would be a good start lol
DID SOMEONE SAY RUNEGLAIVE KAYLE MID
Still better than Devourer Kayle mid
Pls don t
Well hey look on the bright side At least you guys got rid of that dude s
I have a question are you placing s because some people are too dumb to realize that your comment is sarcastic
Yeah basically People are terrible at interpreting sarcasm through text
What are you talking about In my experience people on the Internet are amazing at reading sarcasm
s
yeah best player on the team jajaja
Can she do it though
LOL They didn t ban Darius gg Instant lock
Hey new analyst guy can you play jungle or top
Honestly I think Fnatic made a huge mistake they are short of 2 or 3 players so they should be hiring players first and then analysts D
you don t even need to speak english good
Ja hallo fanatic Ich bins Max Arbeit please Sanks Ach ja und nihao

kek
I personally use the handwriting tool in google translator Korean it s unlinkable just choose Korean in google translator In the text box there s an option for handwriting Alternatively use a Korean keyboard
nuff i can speak alianzo too points given
I mean sure you can be the most formal as you can be or just say Yes Thanks
Cabo
I assume that s so you can live in Germany and read talk to analysts in other regions
yeah its just for analysis its much easier to analyse Korea China if you re familiar with the language
God damn it I was hoping my excellent knowledge of Serbian would help me get the job
the only clue out there is that there wont be only one korean so its either 2 or not at all
Hallo Fnatic Ich spreche the gut jerman
Chinese seems strange as I can t think of any imported Chinese players save for LMQ
Probably more about being able to study the chinese region easier not to talk to players
I can beat 3 beginner bots on Twisted Treeline in under 5 minutes Where do i sign
I ve been absent recently What s this meme about
This
Hi former Fnatic Analyst here Deilor is a fantastic person to work with and I have nothing but good things to say about Fnatic as an org I learned more in the 2 splits I worked with this team than I ve ever learned about anything in any space of time It s a great opportunity for anyone whatever level of experience they have I wish Fnatic only the best of luck for the next year
Any advice for the application process
Take it seriously Showcase your best work Do actual research and don t rush it Deilor is meticulous and will read all the applications thoroughly that aren t immediately troll or straight bad You should aim to take it as seriously as he does
Will do Thanks
thx for the tips As a balancing specialist and a long time league veteran I think I will apply
Why are you no longer an analyst for fnatic Did they decide to change their analysts or did you leave If it was your decision why did you do it
Reddit is not the place for this story Everything will come out soon but suffice to say Fnatic as an org their players the staff and myself are all on great terms There was no bad blood in our parting at all
Ok I understand you don t want to share this I asked out of curiosity But one last question is the salary for the effort and time spent worth the position Especially for someone out of Germany who will have to travel there
The fact that you even ask the question tells me you won t think it s worth it Deilor is the smartest and hardest working coach in Western LoL Their roster is going to be world class This is simply the best opportunity to learn and be involved in esports and you ll be living in the house where food and rent is paid for Money shouldn t even factor in to it But yes the money was worth it for me I don t know how much they ll pay new analysts
Can I just beat twisted treeline in 5 minutes against bots please This is too much work
https twitter com Thooorin status 671301168589578240
I don t get it Can someone explain p
Tsm s new strategic coach used to be an analyst on fnatic
Wow those 2 exercises Thats a lot of effort for a job app
Just to clarify we re more than happy for people to focus on one of the two exercises if they feel they have a specialism in that particular field
I m legitimately interested in applying but would like some insight into how these would be judged Obviously nobody could replicate the work and training that went into preparations for the match against KOO but I m hoping the exercise wouldn t be marked on how similar our report and strategy is to what is known in hindsight but on the quality of approach taken
Why not replicate it As far as I recall that series went the way it did due to personal misplays to a larger extent than failed analysis of their opponent In the end what FNC prepared for the series may easily have been very close to optimal
There were a couple of variables at the very least that weren t accounted for or respected by FNC
Well they ask you to prepare based on KOO s games before the semi final so you d have almost the same hindsight as if you were an analyst at the time Also your analysis would be compared to other applicants so they probably won t disregard your application if it is subpar to what their analysts at the time produced
What I mean is that Fnatic evidently went in with the wrong gameplan because they lost 3 0 We can t be expected to use less information than Fnatic had before the KOO games to come up with a strategy that would have had significantly better results We can state the facts analyse KOO s play know what they ll do before they do it and communicate that to the players in game but nobody would have predicted Huni got dumpstered by Smeb not even Huni himself We know now they should have taken a laneswap or put Huni on a champion that can sit back and farm better like Gnar while banning Fiora But before the game I d have said to let Smeb have Fiora and Huni takes Riven and destroys him just like he had already shown he could that tournament Game 1 was Hec vs Riven and Huni loses game 3 was Riven vs Hec and Huni loses hard Hindsight allows us to know what should have been done Going into the games Huni purposefully took the 1v1 s with the belief he would do well Fnatic s analysts who have been working around the clock trust in this So what I m asking here is whether my analysis that this was the right choice is compared to Fnatics original thoughts to put Huni against Smeb or against the hindsight the team and potential other applicants use to say this was the wrong choice
They re asking you to provide a pre match brief for a game The goal of this is that you ll be hired and be able to do the same thing for them in future So ask yourself how would you provide a pre match brief for future fnatic games Would you wait til the game was over and then tell them what they should have done differently If not then don t do that here either
It s obviously not compared to any hindsight It s compared to the information assumed to be at hand at the time It really shouldn t be very difficult to understand though
You re looking at this in a very hindsight ish oversimplification Huni went into a 1v1 From an analyst perspective how did they arrive at that conclusion In hindsight you can say that was really simple it was wrong but the actual point of this exercise is to look at the situation based on all the information they had at the time and evaluate how to proceed Did anything think that Smeb would crush Huni in a colossal fashion before the games Not really More importantly that analysis alone omits the entire rest of the game There are 8 other players on the teams aside from Huni and Smeb There are additional coaches and analysts behind KOO making ideas and decisions What is your analysis of the entire situation going into the games That s what they re asking for Huni v Smeb may have been an acceptable risk based on and and and Your entire post here even if it s just a casual post only focuses on Huni Huni Huni That s not analysis If random audience bullshit that is far far far removed from actual analysis What would a laneswap have done to Rekkstar vs Prayzilla To the jungle To the jungle support actions To the mid meta shift in support v assassin styles To buff control FNC is asking that the applicant demonstrate what information and what types of considerations goes into their analysis in a short timeframe I know your post is listing an intentionally simplified hypothetical The point is that regardless of what methodology FNC chooses to evaluate the application on all you have to do is submit a very good analysis Period So what if it doesn t match what the prior FNC analysts did Make your analysis and its presentation look better
Well if you propose a strategy which uses only the semi final games as evidence then they can clearly see you haven t done their challenge It assumes a hypothetical which is before the semis However if you propose an alternative strategy to one they used in the semis and it is based off KOO s earlier tournament games then Fnatic will think you ve done a good job Also they know you won t ahve the same depth of analysis as their at the time analysts it s a given and every other applicant will be in the same boat If you re still confused after all this then I m honestly struggling to see what point you are even making
They essentially laid out how a professional analytical report is done normally so there s no way you can bring in hindsight unless you stop analysing what is asked
Especially if you are young this is actually a pretty dam good opportunity to gain experience in evaluate data and come with recommendations for future career Companies are often looking at previous experience like this So good luck if you decide to apply
I d call myself young but going by the majority of the e sports scene 23 is getting on a bit
Same age as me then yeah compared to the e sport scene we are not young anymore But in the end the early twenties is fun when to partying but work and studying sucks They expect master experience hard to get at a young age
Tell me about it got the job I m in at the moment through a friend of the family after applying to places for months it s like a degree in physics isn t worth anything
Dude you need a master to even apply like what the hell or you can probably get a job but not the job you really want sadly
I have a Masters in a science field still cant find a job Either I dont have enough work exp or Im overqualified It never really gets better
I really like that you guys put that out there and it s really appealing as I was surprised how many requirements I fulfill Sadly being busy with my final paper while not having a clue how professional league analysis is supposed to be performed presented from your point of view make it a lot less appealing to put so much work into those tasks
Well part of a data analyst s role is also being creative in the problems that are tackled If you do not enjoy working self directed I would guess that the role is not for you
No it s not that It s just that being a busy student with no work experience in this field makes it questionable to put that much effort into this like I feel was necessary to fullfil my own expectations at this task Having no clue how a professional team expects its analysis makes it kinda tough to know where to lead the analysis if you know what I mean
Well if you put across that sentiment in your covering letter etc they would take it into account when considering you I d assume if you had the intuition for analysis they would give you a chance and teach you about presentation and other weaknesses you may have
I guess you may be right but right now it feels like some big at least I would put much into it effort admittedly totally resonable and justified for a really small chance at getting the job I think it is a big opportunity and I would love to take a shot but I am just sad that for me considering the final paper I am working on it is a totally bad timing to put that much work into it for such a small chance
Don t let your dreams be memes and go for it If it is something you are really interested in you ll regret not taking the shot later
You may be right it would be an awesome job for a guy like me with an inclination to analytical rational thinking still It would take valuable time from my final thesis which I actually need to finish my studies If it doesn t work out I might as well regret it even more I guess I need to sleep over it
Yea all I would say is if you really are passionate about this then you should sacrifice what free time you currently have and do this instead It s only for about a week you re going to have to work hard so try and see it like that rather than just give up before you ve even started
I m an accountant who deals with large amounts of raw data If I moved from my current job to another company or industry still working in accounting I d have to learn what is relevant most important Every company even an esports team should have an outlined procedure you just need to be able to fulfill it
Is this 9th December GMT I am wondering because if it is I have to submit it a day early time zone differential as well as travel
Especially considering the application closes in a week you d have to tailor your CV and a cover letter to it and they re likely looking at a crowd who already has a fairly involved job Meanwhile no mention of anything so basic as what kind of salary people are looking at
We reddit aren t paid to make the best analyzes everyday Fnatic could just read us and win Worlds s

Hired
Doesn t seem that odd to me Having staff members competent in the major regions languages is an obvious advantage whether the team wants to import a foreign player with little knowledge of English or the analysts must work on the foreign pro scenes Chinese will not only help for LPL but also for the less covered yet still internationally relevant LMS EDIT typos and grammar
Cabo Yes
I m perfectly fit for the job I m a Gold 5 player who gets held back by his teams but knows the one key to win is Zilean He can even be played in 3 positionsif you have the balls 5
Thats a lot of demands for a job that will probably give u minimum wage
But just like players the organization provides housing and often covers many expenses A lot of the money that the players and support staff make is simply saved up since they really don t have much to spend on other than personal purchases
But one of the job isn t located in the Fnatic s house it s an online job
Probably a volunteer job like the last time they recruited analysts http www fnatic com content 96467
Don t think so Back then whoever got hired knew it was volunteer work beforehand and worked for under Jarge Now they need a replacement for him there is no way you can cover that with volunteers
This The wage isn t even displayed Furthermore even Goldman Sachs or Merryl Lynch do not ask for that many different competences lol
Wage not being displayed is pretty common Its partly beneficial for the company party hiring because that leaves room for negotiation
Idk which type of jobs you re talking about but in my own experience finance wage is almost always displayed That just seemed weird to me because the offer is very detailed yet there s no indication about the wage even a word like legal or competitive
It could be different from region to region but at least it seems this way in the States Yes the job description and duties is very detailed but at the same time they re looking for people within a variety of qualifications experiences so it would be hard to put a solid wage range I would guess that they re leaving it open to negotiation to pay you what you are worth which is based on what you have done as well as what you can do for them
That makes sense I m from EU though And finance is a peculiar sector where money counts
In NA even if wage isn t displayed its common to list perks like health insurance 401 k s etc Especially given how detailed they want the report to be
Stuff like health insurance is dealt with by the german law Listing wage would be pretty complicated in this scenario Imagine the best analyst from SKT trying to get the job who also speaks german korean chinese and english fluently while having worked as an analyst for 5 years Then you get a student who tries to get a job straight out of university having never done anything in this field Fnatic will try to get the ex SKT analyst if they can affort what he asks for payment If that is too much they negotiate with the student and pay him a third of what the other guy asked for
But in that case you put Depends on Experience not just no wage Health Insurance was a bad example given theyre based in EU and sadly it is a perk here in the US
I am sure they will hire these people as employees but as independent haha subcontractors like the players
I would expect NA jobs to list a pay range Nothing too specific but it sets the expectation for level of qualification For example if I am considering FNC s job advert and I currently work professionally as a well qualified data analyst in a full time job then I could expect 120 000 USD yr However if FNC were to put a rough pay bracket of 30 000 50 000 then I know not to waste my time because it s so far out of FNC s budget or pay expectations
Nearly everywhere in the States would at LEAST say DOE or Competitive
It s a great way to get into esports which is incredibly hard to do Hermit and Parth were remote analysts and probably got paid minimum wage but look where they are now

Fnatic We re recruiting two analysts for our incoming seaso Cabochard YES
Fnatic We are recru Cabo YES
Must know how to write on a whiteboard
No
I don t really get how they can expect people to put so much work into the app without mention of salary range
look at jarge if someone unknown wants to seriously get into esport starting with fnatic is probably the best option no matter how much you are paid
A fnc shirt and a photo of rekkles
Is rekkles wearing a shirt in this picture or not This is vital
The analyst guy gets to live in a big house in Berlin for free and the other guy gets to do his analysis on a beach in Thailand while sipping a Singha beer
I kind of want to apply but I am not sure if it worth the effort without a salary range and if they will prefer EU over NA players
Well that actually depends on the person himself though some people will love to do this for free and just do it for fun Especially for younger guys who are in collage or right after collage it can be extremely valuable to get this type of practice and experience As the opportunities will be limited to show success analysing numbers and giving concise and clear recommendations from these numbers hey the last analyst at fnatic got a sick offer to be tsm s strategic coach
Key part of that is some people By not listing any price range competitive or even DOE it kind of shows they aren t wanting to pay much For all the qualifications they want and the amount of work that goes into that job in general the pool of candidates that can will be successful is very small The real job world is very much a two way street Both sides give a little and then try to meet somewhere inbetween This instance screams of we re doing you a favor by hiring you
ohh for sure but sadly that how esport and organisations in general work i personally would not do it but to start out in this business you got to sacrifice which i personally think is sad for the employees but Fnatic does not want to spend over its budget By disclosing the amount of money on the application form it might make less people apply so in the end as you said it should be a two way stream but it is not
Interesting
after reading all the requirments guess most of the coaches cannot even do that the post not mentioning sth like Pay Range
Probably should recruit a new shop manager as well
Other valued skills Neuroscience education Wat
it s the behavioral psychology coaching part of the job
I wish i could apply to be an analyst in training learn the trade before being relied upon
Is this a we pay you with experience type of thing or is there actualy a salary
Sadly analysts are super underpaid The best ones get 500 month max if you believe what insiders say thats way too less
That doesn t even sound legal
Well they handle it like a parttime job salarywise So it s around 450 500 at best if you are new and have to prove yourself you just get a mousepad and a headset while you work your ass off Most teams do it that way
One you are required to live with the team so they really can t be considering that part time
Yes but you won t make more If you want a good source you can ask LeDuck when he streams former OG and CW Coach about it analysts are at the very bottom in the chain
I guess if they provide you with everything and the money you earn is for leisure only and won t have to be used on other expenses then I d say fair enough
This doesn t make sense to me For this salary i can just go up to some car rent station and ask when can i start I don t need to fullfill any requiremts just having a license
That sounds bollocks I m a gap year student who can earn more than that in a week without even writing an application to do my job teams need to step up their pay
Tell me your secret More than 500 a week I want to do that full time
It really is no fun but I work for Amazon as it is their peak times for the Christmas rush I work over time and get double pay on my 6th day of the week
it is even low for a part time lol
Exercise 1 would be interesting to do even when not applying for the job
exercise 1 takes a lot of time you have to review a lot of games from Koo exercice 2 is a lot easier to make and predict
Ah yes the infrastructure and requirement to create a world class team
Man I d love to be an analyst but I don t meet the age requirements If there s a career I d love to pursue it s e sports analyst coach caster Either of the three would be fine I just think it s what I want to do
Great news hope we find some good analysts
seriously when I see those horrible pick and ban phases I really think every team needs some analyst well I am going to send something in
ME
GOGO Fnatic make it happen
Finatic will be stronger than ever
After this job advert I understood what people mean by effort not worth of money As a guy who recently moved to London with Finance and Accounting exp those req are way over my head I love the game and competition but to do a living from it No way After few years in LoL you will try to pursue classic career and I dunno how you will explain your previous experience and how relevant it will be out of gaming industry Anyway maybe I am a bit sceptical but I wish all the best for a lucky one analyst
as an analyst those are highly valued skills in many many different areas its totally worth it
I ll submit vote for me boys
Ok so with everybody going crazy over those 2 exercices is there anyone that can actually paste them on here Anything gaming related is blocked by firewall and aparrently I can t find a cached copy of the site

Better recruit a good top laner
2 analysts lol and i m assuming they already have at least 1 Soon teams gonna have more analysts then players LoL is getting really big O
They dont have one I think cuz he went to TSM
maybe fnatic should do the same thing like CLG zzzzzzzzzzzzzz whoever finishes the fastest soloq game now zzzzzzzzzz
Salary
To be in a LCS coaching analyst role do you have to also have a really stupid league name handle
A good way to make minimum wage
I like my current full time job in the states and have no intention on applying but those exercises seem pretty neat so I might try them anyways
Obviously gonna be ReignOver and Huni D
After reading that first exercise I am convinced Fnatic has a time machine and is prepping things as much as possible before they use it
wow that application process is incredibly tough and demands a hell of a lot from the applicant A full analysis of the 5 22 5 23 metagame with expected changes That would take an unreal amount of time to collate with properly statistical analysis and methodology I hope this job pays upward of like 50K seriously
Ranked 5s between challenger teams counts Edit also there must be challenger series qualifiers somewhere around soon
Are both of these positions full time jobs
I think they need to hire analysts to analyze why they can t hold on to such great talent immediately after having a strong showing in both the LCS and worlds
I would apply but I don t think I can work with someone like Rekkles if we can sign in another free agent ADC to motivate and maintain competitiveness then I believe I can take Fnatic to the next level
Hire vvvvortic
Also gonna need a new support
Neuroscience education o
Seems strange that it is an in house job It would be very easy to outsource and expand your potential talented applicants by a lot Does someone really need to be on site to provide all this information when there are many online communication tools that would more than suffice
There are two positions one is in house the other is online remote just for clarity
Fnatic We re looking for new ana Cabo YES
LEZ GO FNC
fnatic approaches its final form good very good
mfw i m willing to try and have decent thoughts on how to do both exercises but schedule on next 3 weeks is fucking insane and i will rarely have a spare hour
http i imgur com uMNAEeX gif
I love how proactive the FNC org is The season doesnt start until 2 months and they are already preparing In contrast to some other orgs who wait until the last second to make important moves
I mean they could be making moves behind the scene Organizations don t really have an obligation to keep us in the loop
I speak a little German and I have deep and profound understanding of low silver elo scene do you think I should apply
No EU or NA team has the money to pay for someone qualified in all these fields Your basically looking for an even smarter Parth to get paid lower than parth lmao
Parth isn t even good Any analyst can be smarter than him
k
Korean or Chinese Language ability spoken written and reading Korean and chinese top jungler confirmed
Not at all Those language skills might be beneficial when analyzing China Korea regions or exchanging thoughts with analysts from there
chaser leaving jin air rumours on fnc chaser and now a requirment of being able to speak korean fnc chaser confirmedWTF even Ohq got axed
Honestly him and Duke were the only really bright lights on that team even Tank needed some work
I ve said it before and i m going to again Ohq has potential to be better ADC than both Imp and Deft
ofc he has thats nothing new
don t really think it s that obvious since his contract was just terminated
I m 100 sure that Ohq wanted to leave and Najin couldn t keep up with all the bids and decided to let him go
Is that what we call regions outside of Korea now
I would be saddest person if he went to some garbage region LPL
Termination of a contract doesn t mean the company dropped him due to skill
No wonder CLG flair isn t impressed with the potential talk
He s his own worst enemy
That s so true
True of a lot of ADCs come to think of it
I think he s already right up there now Mechanically I d say only Imp is better and that s not even true on every champion I haven t seen Deft really tested either
Potential Korea edition
potential is nothing until you can prove ohq s offensive style is amazing to watch but that doesn t mean ihe is capable of outshining them
who are you
In my opinion Deft is overrated anyways first times I saw Ohq play Tristana in teamfights man you could tell he s a level above everyone else in the world except Imp I guess
I think you re overrating him there He hasnt proven anything under alot of pressure He dumpsters low level teams but if he comes up against imp pyl deft meiko or bang wolf i dont think he could keep up Would like to see him in Vici with Mata tho
SSB Deft was the best team fighting ADC in the world maybe 2nd behind Namei then EDG Deft before they slumped during summer play offs or w e he improved his laning a lot and was the best ADC in the world for a while He s always been known for his team fighting though
You should check out his Lucian
And then he randomly dies or gets caught by whole enemy team Ohq
Your name real suits your analysis
You arent equipped to make statements like that from so few games lol
Pretty much everyone else thinks he was or is the best team fighting adc and imp said he was the best adc in the world so maybe he deserved a decent amount of hype
Peanut has a lot of potential
I mean tank was really ballin when the meta suited poke mids but that s been out for a while now and ggoong has always been on off and I always viewed him like reapered sometimes he ll walk in and stomp everyone like the gauntlet for s4 worlds and sometimes he s just average
Najin is getting out of League The team buying them likely wanted to only keep Duke and have the freedom to build a fresh roster beyond that It actually makes a lot of sense tbh Sad that Duke would agree to stay however when he would surely be a front runner for top lane at pretty much any of the good LCK teams
Peanut also stays so its not that bad for Duke
Except most of the good Korean teams have good top laners This isn t NA
Its rumoured that they are selling the spot so may be no Na Jin next split
No more Gambit and no more Najin for S6 Dang that kinda hurt
Man im a gambit and najin fan lol
Root for the Tigers They re 4 5 Najin and Smeb the god
Najin Tigers
Naniwa Tiger
even their coach is from najin
True I forgot about that
N A Jin
NoJin
Shingeki No Najin
Have my orange pointy thingy
At least buy him dinner first
I know Ever is rumored to disband but maybe they can get a sponsor and come to LCK
I m not sure if the current Ever squad will remain together They are probably all getting offers from China Especially the mid and AD
It s already begun Ever is basically kill
The current Ever botlane previously played in China for EPC so I wouldn t be surprised
Key probably as well And since he won t be able to play in the LCK because of his ban it s only logical for him to go
Ban Explain please
He got caught eloboosting https www reddit com r leagueoflegends comments 3sslj0 spoiler esc ever support player key is under Ban isn t confirmed yet just speculation but it wouldn t surprise me
This is so huge for any team looking for an ADC
CLG could really need a better mid laner
I heard pobelter is a free agent
but i heard Huhi was better s but seriously who could CLG get atm that would be good
froggen
Froggen Selfie Soren are all free agents and very good
easyhoon or coco
reasonably get
My boy link
is dat him
I m in love with the CoCo
Give Huhi time perhaps he will improve He is young
Well I would assume he was given time to improve the entire split pob was playing
That isn t stage experience though
im sure they are trying to cut costs Ohq maybe asked for an increase in his salary
right if you plan on keeping your spot in lck why not just build a team around your star player to enable the shit out of him
Well that probably ends Watch s career unless he can Ambition his way as well I will miss his face a lot He did have a lot of legacy as well
if a team wants fans he s your man
Yo I d take him on CJ just to look at his beautiful face On the real though watch isn t bad at all Najin wasn t very good this past season and I d love to see him on another roster
The games I ve seen Najin field Watch in playoffs were actually pretty decent and I thought his Gragas and Lee mechanics were worthy of respect So I m a little confused to why he is considered the weak link
Not consistent can t play other meta champions well enough Bengi had the same problem but then he suddenly became great again
TSM Watch
I think they have enough fans to not worry about this
can never have to many fans
Yeah but it s mostly dudes Watch will bring in the fangirls
Watch and Flame need to get together and form the boy band equivalent of a League of Legends team
Thoorin can be their manager
I d watch that Behind The Scenes Reality Series Call it Skrilla or something
Sponsored by Alphadraft
skrilla
Thanks
Well Watch is already in kpop videos https www youtube com watch v K6lH6g1Z97E
I think flame has already played with enough bad junglers as it is
The return of the flower 5
Frozen mid
Watch flame Helios maybe Madlife
he has a hot voice too no homo that guy should have been a kpop star
He was in a K Pop video once
Here is the Kpop video of Watch if you were wondering https www youtube com watch v K6lH6g1Z97E He appears at 1 40 and the song is pretty good
Yo Heechul filmed this in a an episode of A Style for You once
He s in almost the entire video just wearing his jersey at 1 40
What s with the number of pretty boys in SK he probably could not have been a kpop star even if he wanted to Though now with his popularity acquired from being a progamer it might well be feasible
If you are talking about it seriously Kpop idols generally start training when they are 10 16 years old but they debut at 16 at the very earliest most at 18 21 don t worry about lolita complexes in kpop The fact that Ohq is 19 means he s way too late sorry for ruining anyone s weird fantasies Edit Sorry forgot about BoA and IU although they aren t exactly conventional idols soloists both known for extremely good vocals which means that they can earn money much sooner without much training don t have to hide in a group
April just debuted and their maknae Jinsol is 13
Obviously there are outliers there was a group made up of 10 year olds coiple years ago but they tend to fail since most men arent attracted to 13 year old girls
Yes there are outliers but the comment I replied to implied that 16 was the outlier rather than the 16 was on the young side of normal and that they can go younger but those tend to be rare
what is a maknae o O
Youngest
Youngest member
TWICE s Jihyo started training at 7 BoA debuted when she is 13 years old
Oh is that so I didn t know But what about those groups formed by race queens I know there are some can t recall the names I don t suppose they were trained from their teens
In extremely rare cases they will take those that didn t train for years on end Could only be for women though
well he can retire into china na like other koreans
The Koreans who went to China have mostly been top tier ones and with China s recent performance I imagine they ll be very hesitant about recruiting a Korean who s generally considered well past his prime A lot of NA teams have also been trying to shift to monolingual rosters with Liquid and NRG being the only confirmed multi lingual rosters in season 6 as far as I know
I m sure a Chinese team would love to pick up watch like VG picked up Vasilii
The infamous watch finger snap at camera
he is so handsome
CJ Ohq would make me sooooo happy
Apparently Space Ohq when you ask CJ
Space Uzi according to CJ
CJ and their ad carries man
stixay ohq when you ask clg
I m not even a CJ fan but please make this happen They deserve a good ADC
that would be too easy for Madlife to play with a actual performing AD carry
Duke promoted to Archduke Peanut promoted to Archpeanut Hope they can build a great new team
All hail archpeanut
All hail Britannia
All hail Lelouch
Lelouch Vi Britannia commands you Obey me world
I will not let you do that SPINZAKU
I thought these would be new accounts but no just a really weird coincidence that you both found this comment chain That s pretty cool
Haha I hardly use this account I browse on my main account and switch to this for humour purposes whenever I see something related to CG
Damn Ohq getting kicked came out of no where
Not kicked Najin or the team buying their spot couldn t afford to hold onto Ohq He has very large offers from both China and NA
Huh Ohq
not kicked he has offers najin couldnt compete with so no contract renewal
CJ Reach If CJ gets Shy Watch Ggoong Ohq Madlife at least they would have a lot of fans
imagine the CJ Najin coach swap After all that rivalry it would be a sight to see
CJ should get rid of Shy imo 2 splits way past his prime as of this point
the last thing shy did well was nlb spring 2014 that was almost 2 YEARS ago and even that was more swift and coco than shy
The first team I ever supported was Najin Black Sword and as a result Duke and Ohq have always been two of my favourite players so I feel very conflicted that Duke has stayed but not Ohq I am very happy that Peanut is still there though Najin can build a very strong team around a core of Duke and Peanut Would have been stronger with Ohq I just hope he finds a team actually good enough for him so he can prove that he s one of the world s best Also I thought Najin were disbanding
It does look like Najin is disbanding Whoever is coming in probably wanted Duke It s such a damn shame too NJBS was my first OGN team I supported after watching Summer champions 2012 They weren t the best at the time but they played with a lot of heart When sister teams ruled out I went with the tigers though
This might be harder to accept than disbanding zzzz Don t mind the player releases except for Ohq no sense there unless he really wanted to leave I loved Reach s work with Shield last year but I can t comment on how he personally has done this year Mostly devastated to lose Ohq
Ohq might have gotten a new contract somewhere else which wouldnt be surprising All najin fans can hope for is that they rebuild a solid core around peanut and duke as playmakers
Id be surprised if CJ and few other koreans didnt try and get ohq
Why would they Space would just dump all those spicy lewd pics he has on CJ s owner No amount of chance for success is worth the embarrassment
In Space Prison no one can hear you scream
CJ the CLG of OGN Champions lol
Atleast clg have won something recently and have been performing decently CJ has been irrelevant since Imp crushed blaze in that finals in s3
i would be surprised if they try
damn Fionn teased it was gonna be tragic but DAAAAAAMN
Source of translate is Fomos Kenzi https twitter com kenzi131 also somehow najin kept Duke and peanut
Duke Peanut Frozen Fury Ignar is possibly the best they can get right now
Not necessarily remember that a plethora of perma benchwarmers from other large orgs are likely being tossed around as we speak
Duke and Peanut are probably locked ADC is up for grabs imo mid who knows Frozen seems like solid option I d rather take him over Nagne since I think Coco will be in KT next split dade pawn and rookie will probably stay in LPL Support has much solid options like Zero Heart Mata maybe
Coco confirmed going into foreigner league
That would be a really good team but I doubt IM even if they want to make a super team are willing to let go their arguably best players
deleted
He s already signed though I think he s assuming IM will get rid of Frozen Ignar for their super team and Samsung CoreJJ was confirmed
deleted
No he s on Sbenu Ever s jungler was Ares
There goes Najin CJ hop to
Ggoong the zed legend
so ever becomes najin hopefully
Good for Reach He deserve a better team Wonder if KT is interested on hiring him since he played for them back on Starcraft 1 for a long time before he entered the military
my heart is crying This is the end of Najin
good give the spot to an org that will pay to keep top talent like ohq honestly
Well at least they kept Duke
I think they are planning to buy another team entirely or sell their spot and then recruit from scratch again Then there s the easy guess of making a team around Duke Peanut
They should keep Ohq get Coco and a new support
lmao
Ohq would be a great addition to a lot of teams imo Genuinely surprised his contract was also terminated even if another team is buying Najin s spot
Hmm I wonder if the new NA team owners pay big bucks to any of the new KR free agents It will be a loud ending to the offseason though
Selling their spot it seems Ohq can be an upgrade in a lot of team but for example fucking CJ are sticking up with Space I hope its the end of the career for Watch i was a big fan in s2 s3 but now its just sad and Ggoong can only go to bottom Na team if he want to be an upgrade
What about their ARAM coaches Ggoong and Watch had their moments Tank and Ohq got some talent I don t recall anything their coaches contributed to the team
Hey so when do I wake up from this nightmare Thanks
Mantoss kicked
what no SKT Duke
Hmm now I don t have any clue now who could be the new toplaner for SKT
PEANUT about to shine
OhQ and his OHHHHHH Q moment Let s see what Najin can bring on the table now
More roster changes I WANT TO GET OFF MR OFFSEASON S WILD RIDE
Damn Mantoss was a big reason I became a Najin fan
I wonder why they didn t cut the other coaches as well
Xpeke yes
What
holy fuck what a bloodbath Najin aren t pulling their punches
Mantoss Reach
Yeah it s the same guy
wtf only ggoong and watch needed to leave and they needed to get Easyhoon fuck this team man i m done supporting this retardation clown fiesta for the last 2 years
deleted
wrong thread buddy
Is that everyone Is najin leaving the scene then
Nooooo pls Ohq get a good team D R I P Najin c
You get fired you get fired everybody gets fired
Najin CJ AND Jin Air are falling apart What
Wow with China sucking Korea falling apart and EU coming to NA we ll looking to become the best region after all s
Najin Worlds buff lost time to axe watch
So just wipe the entire roster including coaches and get better people pretty much
Najin Tigers incoming
I know NaJin fans are going to be sad that Ohq left but I really think that the guy was a little bit overrated he was amazing in lane yes but think of how many games he lost by being overaggressive diving tanks under the enemy towers Yes probably its still a lose since its unlikely that they will find someone better but they still managed to keep their best player that s a success in my bookYou forget Team Dragon Knights in NA
prepare to be amazed It s complete arrogance because they got lucky last time
cheap skates man If this is real I seriously hope they get relegated for ruining fans expectations and wasting everyone s time
ass haha
mine already left
H2k and Origen can keep the standard high
Swede bejong
Swedish Jock betongjocke I seriously hope Fnatic get relegated if this is their team disrespectful to the fans Penny pinchers
Yellowstar Freeze Froggen soon to be added Now imagine Doublelift Aphromoo Darshan Pobeltor Sneaky Altec Iwilldominate Adrian all left NA LCS and NA wasn t allowed to import Koreans EU is 97 EU players How much would NA be hurt
Gilius Giliuus Nov 29 this offseason went from 0 to 100 real quick Gilius Giliuus Nov 26 Just wanted to say that I didn t sign for any team yet and that I am still open for lcs offers Lewis Felix NoXiAKX Nov 29 this Preseason is going pretty crazy https twitter com FlamingBiFi status 664662747326599168
true These 3 managed are managing to hold on to obvious new players everyone knows with out leaking or being very childish about it
TSM and NA in general is very childish Immortals are only respectable one I ve seen in off season so far
Because EU is stronger as a region It s like Lebron James Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry going to EuroLeague
Fnatic owner said that s BS
TSM is not as big an org as Fnatic Fnatic are just being really really cheap TSM can afford to pay huge wages for 5 guys but Fnatic can t even do it for 1
lol no
ofcourse they are I even forgave them for Huni RO duo But Yellowstar is the captain their icon their leader they have to pull out all the stops to keep him
They were only formed last year ofcourse i m a bandwagoner Some of my fav players and apparently willing to pay them
this pretty much confirms it right there
fking knew it
Would make sense heard SK got 2 weak Koreans
Fnatic and Origen are my joint fav teamsNo need to panic It s sad to see them go because of their incredible legacy involving everything they did to grow the Starcraft and LoL scenes here in Korea but this really isn t going to effect the current production value at all Both had already moved on a while ago to positions at OGN that involved the larger overseeing of other PDs rather than working directly on broadcasts themselves I m sure they ll do great work in China and I m looking forward to what they bring to the scene
Good to know Hope OGN continues to prosper
Long live OGN
Thank you for calming my heart
OGNRESISTANCE V2
All Hail OGN
i thought they already left to china last year with all the players i coulda sworn they did the promos for LPL
and as always OGN Prevails
Are you and Monte secure
Don t panic
B b b b ut Reddit told me that OGN is shit now and LCK is dead Their assumptions must be right
When did anyone ever say that OGN is shit now
Korean reddit says that but on here everybody likes ogn
Korean exodus part 2 First their players now this
What saddened me the most out of all the korean exodus was the ogn opening filming producers They left to China and so the amazing OGN opening sequences became crap And for the summer season they didn t even have one I want the openings back A
as a korean and an avid fan of korean LoL this is really sad every offseason there s something that seems to set korea back more than other regions and viewership cuts may hurt the scene a lot hopefully the pros don t lose sight of what s important though they have never disappointed the fans at the world stage
Well look at it this way When you are on top there is no other way but down Best teams best players best production Every change that happens will probably look like a downgrade
If you re at the top you can look to improve over your former performances A SKT that practiced 6 hours a day and still won worlds may be at the top but one that practiced 10 hours a day will look dominant Every chance that happens doesn t necessarily have to be a downgrade
But worlds is ruined whenever a Korean team wins I refuse to watch unless a western team is playing s
Don t worry young Korean your region will be always strong talent wide and also in viewership because LCK has a lot of nice quality matches but i would be happy if a non Korean team would win next year
I don t think korea will win every world They ll lose at one point It s not like Korea have to win every worlds
This might be an unpleasant thought but what if Korea really does end up winning every single worlds Like for the next 3 worlds they win Then League fades away and dies down I d imagine it would have a negative impact on the game overall as less and less people non Korean fans would be interested in watching the competitive scene Scary thought Just imagine if Korea reaches to a point where they re completely undefeatable
Why is everything called an exodus
The last Korean exodus started with one of the Samsung players leaving
2 producers That s like if Faker and Marin left for China Sure only 2 players but that s the 2 very best
Everyone loves putting religious overtones Can t wait for the crucifixion of NA
Not everything is called an exodus
as long as they keep their plastic surgeon they are fine
bruh
why do americans inject things in their butts to make them look more fat like why really and why do europeans think its cool to wear speedos and pop their collars like really seriously lol
lol no chill
deleted
You have Americans confused with britbongs We have our ECV s and McDonalds
Korea to change country name to China 2
You mean China change country name to Korea 2
My b
It would honestly be healthy for competitive LoL if Korea gets weaker The rest of regions will catch up and we will have more competition for first places Watching Koreans stomp everyone got really boring
Actually if the Koreans are strong then the rest of the World will have to step up their game and the whole world profits
No Korea is the shining epitome of power that all other regions look up to and want to emulate It incentivises other regions to improve which leads to higher competition And I completely disagree that watching Koreans is boring Their playstyle is very interesting and they execute their strategies better than anyone else China has been their fiercest rival ever since S3 but they flopped at worlds This is also going to be a wake up call to them because I feel like they got cocky and came unprepared
Why are people striving and wishing for things to be average and mediocre Why can t people just wish for a better competition through western team becoming better instead of artificial competitiveness through fucking up Korea
Because Western fanboys realized that with fair competition they cannot win
Last year everyone thought the same I don t think Korea ever will be weak at this point Just new talents will replace the players whos leave
Indeed Ever going 2 0 against SKT and 3 0 against CJ Entus to sweep the Kespa Cup is perfect proof of this They have a constant supply of fresh blood from behind LCK The same thing has been happening to China with LGD IG getting destroyed by unknown challenger teams The west is really behind in this regard they don t have tournaments like these to give challenger teams a real chance to prove themselves versus their regular LCS teams
You do know that Challenger teams constamtly scrim against OGN teams some of the OGN teams even have 2 of 3 Challenger teams
Or Western teams can stop being garbage OG and FNC are the best teams from the west have ever done outside of season 1 and while I m not going to sit here and say that their world championship win doesn t count it was a much different landscape with no eastern teams in it so i consider a semi final finish today better than the win in season 1 and they still got 3 0 d by KOO and SKT If the rest of the west could catch up to the level of FNC and OG then they could definitely become much more competitive regions but ruining Korea doesn t breed competition it destroys it Trying to say that this would make the game more competitive is by and far the absolute single most stupid thing anyone on the whole of Reddit has ever said
It d be healthier if you re a western fan You care way more about narrative than actual competitive play which is just a shit outlook to have on the game
And on the seventh day chinese money
rip hilariously bad lpl hype videos
In a few more years they ll have everyone except Faker
The year is 2019 Every Korean pro has now been exported to China Faker the final Korean decides to join North America or New Europe as it s called now to fight his Korean enemies stomping them and sending them back to Korea
great anime plot m8
2019 Worlds FncOri Counter Mid vs SK Galaxy Sbenu SKGS players left team mid match to join FOCM residency laws overruled as match place is an artificial rotating island off the Bermuda triangle and KR live coverage simultaenously collapsed New Europe almost had a chance but winions happened and KR wins another Worlds as NE drowns in salty spaghetti sauce
And somehow they ll still stomp the World Championship
Faker will either play all 5 roles simultaneously or SKT will find a way to clone Faker
Faker playing 10 roles just hims versus himses at worlds

No Faker
Holy moly those were the guys that greeted CLG when we first went to Korea in 2012 Crisis Wi on the left was the head honcho that ran the production Fantastic guy he s done a lot for ESports in Korea So weird to see them leave to China must be dat https www youtube com watch v LXtLD0MYB 8 ps HI DOA
I thought he was rumored to be leaving esports
Hi hotshot I miss seing you play Nid back in the day
I m like the bringer of down votes
At first I was like WHOA this is some really oldschool CLG fun that can find some interesting facts about his favourite team Then I read your comment and understood that it was Hotshot not a CLG fun
i hope this isnt what kills LCK
I would be really upset I love watching LCK
Its fine the Chinese will take care of LCK as well by the time s
OGN
Of course not Riot will support the region
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Riot are doing their best to kill Korea since S4
Not sure if people legit believe this
No Its a troll
I can totally understand why people jump to these conclusions though Getting rid of the old OGN format and removing sister teams really hurt the korean scene as it created a vacuum of spots which then forced a huge loss of talent and we only have to go through the names that left korea to see how huge it was Also to see riot not stepping in and taking OGN s side with the broadcast rights issues is dissapointing seeing all the service OGN has done for growing league as an esport in Korea by basically starting a barebones league with the MiG and Najin type orgs from season 2 I have no doubt this has something to do with the silent yet un happy marriage of Tencent and Riot
This is still not even relatively true take off the tinhat and return to r conspiracy
Ignore him he s a troll and he does this often
Yea sure because OGN Producers leaving has nothing to do with Riot forcing OGN to share their competition with SpotTV right
Of course we re all conspiracy theorists right guys Riot s been doing same shady stuff for years now taking esports away from capable tournament organisers taking english broadcasts away from passionate and capable independent talent now taking the best competitive LoL broadcast away from the fans jesus christ I love watching your game competitively but I dont want to watch your fucking LCS production and LCS casters ffs I want to watch Monte Doa and Papa with Fall Out Boy s Alone Together during intermissions and hot Korean lady doing interviews with pros I can t understand I fucking love that Fuck your LCS
fuck this speech got me hyped up WHERE IS MY FUCKING PITCH FORK WHERE IS THE GUY THAT SELLS THEM SHOW YOURSELF I HAVE SOME ANGER IN ME
It s related to Riot earning more money and expanding as a company Not some George Bush 9 11 sabotage conspiracy bullshit
trying so hard to make sure league doesnt turn into another sc2 where its full of koreans how about we fuck em up on the inside the fans wont know what hit em we ll just start random shit that makes no sense
They did their best to kill M5 GMB They just do some stuff to kill Korea
Some context with m5 gmb please
There was like 1 remake vs SK which they ended up losing when they had originally won and some Visa issues when LCS went to London because Riot didn t tell them soon enough Not really a conspiracy
Those visa issues ruined my whole fucking weekend

Doa just confirmed that two experienced OGN Producers are leaving on his stream Source http www twitch tv ggdoa v 27908434 3 06 20
He says it s not that big of a deal Here s hoping
They were overseeing the other guys not actually producing anymore so production wise there will be no problems
wait what doa streams that s amazing
Dat Monte on a raptor tho lmao
yay lpl might actually become watchable
China confirmed Cell
In his final form or what
This is only his Semi Perfect form once he takes the OGN casters as well then he shall be complete
Source https twitter com proxywolf status 671221405703254018
Holy shit Wolf lol Haven t thought of this dude more than once or twice since I switched from SC2 to League
same makes me wonder what are tastosis nowadays up to Are they still casting gsl I think I randomly saw artosis playing some Heartstone tournament as a semi pro once and even involved in the HotS scene but not sure
Yeah he plays the occasional Hearthstone tournament And he did try and latch on in the HotS scene as well as some Dota 2 dabbling But as far as I m aware he s still active in he SC2 casting scene
Korea will still win season 6 worlds lol
The korean exodus is bigger that what we thought
incoming korean LCS
IT S ALL TUMBLING DOWN
LOL does that mean all the cringe LPL hype videos will be gone
This is great News for us enjoying the Chinese LoL scene
The gap is closing
more stable than ever
Yes in season 3 they were the second best region and since then they ve improved to third best Any more gap closing and they ll be neck and neck with NA
r nottheESEX
The first thing I checked was the link MFW inven co kr
Korea needs to up their pay scale Otherwise this will never stop
not like korean teams are owned by billionaires
They are lol Samsung owns a LoL team
SKT and Samsung aren t exactly small companies I don t know much about the other teams to comment I m just saying if Korea doesn t want to keep losing all their LoL talent players behind the scenes peeps alike They need to start offering competitive salaries However the exodus may have weakened Korea as a whole It did nothing for China Chinese teams looked terrible at worlds Glad those players got to make a bit of money before going back to Korea
Except those are large corporations with accountants who wouldn t like to spend much on a esports team In China we have young men with lots of money playing team owner They are more likely to dump more into esports than the corporate bean counters
With Najin disbanding it will be interesting to see other orgs reactions if viewing drops due to popular players leaving Do they up the pay for players to try and keep viewers or just say it s not worth it and disband
Riot Games Lowering the quality of Korean e sports since 2014
Is it Riot fault if China pays more
Everything is Riot s fault Lose a match RIOT WTF Missed the bus FUCKING RIOT Donald Trump gets elected president I HATE YOU RITO
You mean that Riot doesn t control the Chinese economy
how can they work china they dont even speak chinese
how do all these football players work in europe when they dont speak the respective european language
Why would football players go to europe The sport isn t even played outside of the US s
football the one played with your feet
come on dude I m also american and i know what they re talking about
I do too that s why I put s
Money talks

OGN has worked with LPL tournaments before
how do these famous coaches for football coach around the world in other countries
speak english but the chances that a korean and a chinese both speak english is rare especialy those low IQ ones
with your logic i have high IQ being asian that can understand english
yup
They made such epic trailers even Riots world trailers were garbage in front of OGN quality I hope the replacements are just as good
I m guessing they re going to work for Wang Sicong who recently bought LPL broadcasting rights
Looks like China will be getting a dose of Paramore during the intermissions
lol even producers are leaving KR for that chinese money

Welp Whoever gets their jobs has some very very big shoes to fill They ve set quite a high standard
Reading that title I first thought this was gonna be an ESEX article
Not too far away from Whole OGN moves to China
Didn t expect this one
Looking forward to what OGN will bring next season it s sad to see them go but it s not necessarily a huge loss in quality production
R notesex
the chinese nation has attacked again first taking the players now the producers
WTF China
So it looks like China is promised land so many hopes and hype going on maybe next year they will evolve and show the world
The big question what will happen to DoA and Monte
When even OGN producers go to China for money
Guess Uzi breaking a keyboard and a Radioactive ripoff with a nobody in Faker s spot can only get you so far Seriously though can China s poaching please stop at players and wild animals EDIT They ve taken Coach Park WE has FireBatHero and they re now getting those of OSL fame
Instead of blaming China isn t this more about the broadcast issues fault from Riot Kespa SpoTV If the producers have the chance to continue doing what they love which is producing I don t see any reason not to take that chance even if they ll be doing it in another region
its all kespa and riot kr Riot main office doesn t have any involvement in this broadcasting issue
Beginning of the end for LCK
Don t forget all the drama with SpotTv and Kespa Low chance but still a chance that by summer split OGN will only be broadcasting half the games Don t blame these producers at all for moving to a much larger stage that also has more job security
I though for sure this would be ESEX lol
Meanwhile EU fans cry because they loses 10 player lmao
Korea loses 30 players coaches analysts former starcraft 2 pros firebathero to coach Team WE for example and now producers
Its ten players from a smaller pool And why is this a reason to not cry about losing talent in a region Just cuz korea was hit by a truck EU doesnt have to act cool getting run over by a car
It s not a car It s a bike at best And if you cry over getting hit by a bike you re a baby
When I was like 8 my sister ran over my ankle with her bike Shit hurts yo
stop sucking korean cock once in your life time
It s funny because EU fans are so offended by people not constantly praising their little region and giving attention to a bit more deserving one
I m surprised you managed to write something with two korean cocks in your hands
Most EU fans like u kahaxd are the product of incest
Is that a korean dick in your mouth
Sorry did the EU inbreed say something
how much koreans dick are you sucking on a daily basis
lol exactly EU exodus pales in comparison to Korean exodus part 2
But in the end they remain the strongest EVER defeating SKT and then CJE to win Kespa shows that they have talent which can surpass even the legends themselves You can take away their most famous players but their challenger players will rise and dominate you
i wonder if the Korea exodus will ever stop because there going to be a over supply of korean players in NA and China lol
Yep Kinda makes me sad how US has more than 10x Korea s population and yet they have so little native talent There is not a SINGLE American export to other regions
um korea has more players than the us and why would someone leave the us when they can stay
Challenger players are also going to CN
Well some challenger players A team is far more than talented players though Teammates need to know each other well enough to cooperate with each other and that comes with both natural synergy and time LGD has shown this more than anything they have some of the best players in the world but can t work together to achieve victory I digressed but my point is that Koreans are known for their teamwork which is why they are so dominant
whelp hopefully this puts a stop to all the random shots of girls in the middle of matches
That s my favorite part lol
I don t even know why did I laugh at this
Why is everyone assuming this is because of the broadcasting rights issue instead of money China wants to grow their scene and let s be honest their broadcasting needs work so it makes sense to pay a ton of money to two accomplished producers whom helped build sc2 and lol in Korea
Seems like a poor decision Producers need to be able to communicate clearly and coherently Relaying between translators is going to fuck it all up
THEY TOOK OURRR
Money talks just ask EU
i thought ogn was part of china
Riot want absolutly to destroy Korea I think it s a conspiracy from FNC fanboys
Yes me and Febiven made a plan a while ago but now it s pointlesss you got us Mission abort i repeat Febiven Mission abort Great work there detective
Damn Im a genius
it s funny how cn buying everything from everywhere ok only kr falling deeper and deeper what next cn you wiil buy monte doa faker kespa NT
Money continues to ruin everythingBTW CoreJJ and Helper former CJ sub top laner also join Samsung http www inven co kr webzine news news 147480 site lol
Did they seriously replace Fury That guy was such a talent Best player on s5 ssg any news where he is going I want to follow him
They probably werent able to retain him if anything
I sure hope that s the case I love watching him play
For sure There s no way he didn t have at least Chinese offers if not Jin Air
I certainly hope so CoreJJ in place of Fury Holy moly that s a terrible move I hope Fury gets a good spot this coming season I m assuming the new IM powerhouse roster is likely which would be super good
Yeah it blows my mind that they would want someone who couldn t even stomp in NA Shit he couldn t even do well in NA He s going to get ripped apart
I think that a Korean moving back to a team where they speak his native language and on to a roster that might actually have better support than DIG is going to be good for CoreJJ s gameplay I don t think its fair to ever expect a single Korean to just shit stomp NA cause NA is trash We ll just have to wait and see tho
His individual play was bad
Everyone s a critic
somebody has to be
NA has most of their talent in the ADC position and his support was kiwikid I don t know if that really means much
Remember vasilli when he went back to China He crushed in NA on LMQ but got replaced within one split on Vici Gaming Idk if the same things gonna happen but still relevant
Remember when Dandy went to China He crushed in Korea but was forced to play toplane within one split on Vici Gaming LPL works in mysterious ways
He wasn t forced to play toplane at all they just had to replace toplaners and didn t have anyone that was very good so he decided to go top because their backup jungler wasn t too much of a drop from him and he would be a lot better than their other top laner It was at least officially his own decision and nobody on the team thought their new jungler was an upgrade
Maybe Fury went to Najin or CJ
There have been rumours in inven that he will go to NA nothing sure though
Samsung not going to season 6 worlds confirmed
they will go no matter what It s the curse
nah that s not how the curse works
TWo curses will collide Ambition at worlds and Samsung s6
Meme meme meme vs Meme meme
Two curses did collide and neither one of them made it to worlds nor did they win the NA LCS
Think you confused Watch with Ambition
Ambition never gets to worlds and the winner of worlds always doesnt get there year after adn then gets there next year
aaah my bad
Why is bambition still jungling
Why is Ambition still playing
Ambition probably
I d like to point out that Caesar was murdered because he was too Ambitious
Well luckily for Ambition he s not the greatest Jungler He s not roamin enough to die like Caesar
Regi was murdered s
lol
At least Caesar could get across the river
And Brutus is an honorable man
Not that Samsung was any good last season He can t make it worse for them
They were looking up towards the end of the season Lots of potential
Yeah but those last few games they looked good weren t games that mattered for most other teams Also I can t help but remember that Duke equalizer into entire Samsung roster at bot Fnatic brush
I mean they are replacing one of the better adcs in the lck in fury
Samsung want to make more stupid decision than CJ for 2 seasons WTF would you want Ambition in the jungle Samsung you had the 2 best teams in the world in S4 and now that
to be fair it was MVP who created those teams not Samsung
apparently it s the same guys or something like that someone would have to confirm but the same staff or something is looking to put a team together now I m not sure if it s with IM or SS but that s what is floating around
Didn t the Samsung coaches go to China during the exodus
yes they did homme is at vg i think he was the coach of ssw
He is not the coach who made samsung what it was Homme was a player on MVP White Retired right before from S3 finals
After he retired he became a coach for Samsung
I think his point is that he wasn t involved in the roster construction of the Samsung teams that were dominant in S4
Yeah word It s the original IM guys putting a squad together
Didn t say something denying that Just saying that he is not the coach who made the samsung what it was
the only things I remember about Samsung powerhouse are Samsung bought MVP Samsung got PawN Samsung swapped both PawN and dade team
and Easyhoon played in mvp blue before pawn tooo although he didnt look that good
And got 2 best team in the world in S4 from a team who was a meme machine after their performance at worlds S3 and another one who wasnt even there
MFW Ambition becomes the jungler for Samsung EDIT also heres the samsung FB post
r shittytumblrgifs
It might as well be a still painting because it feels like a single frame
Was funny though
Dandy to Ambition
Dandy and Spirit to Ambition
will he still be playing jungle
I see no reason to replace Crown with a guy who hasn t played mid in over a year Crown is young and talented consistently top10 in soloq
yea crown is great When he was in Brazil he wasn t that good but going back to Korea with such a better infrastructure made him a much better player in just a few months
Holy hell that s brilliant
mid or jungle crown had so much potential if ambition takes mid
jungle
Not sure maybe someone can translate the article
oh how the mighty have fallen but seriously how the fuck did ambition get on another team is he going back to mid
samsung replacing eve and losing fury wtf
Say what you want to say about him but I love Ambition AMBITION FIGHTING 3 3 3
I think what Samsung needs is an experienced player who can lead the team during games so this might not be that bad for the team
I dont think it s bad idea as well ambition is authoritative and has a lot of experience samsung werent worldbeaters anyway the wierd thing is that they didnt keep fury
You see He s going to freaking SAMSUNG to play alongside CoreJJ This is how done he is with your shit CJ
this team looks terrible
Please be a joke Please be a joke Please be a joke
Can you please explain I m not familiar with this guy
Was one of the best midlaners on season 2 and 3 until all stars Got solo killed afterwards tilted until he ended up in the jungle for CJ
Thanks
He was once the best mid in Korea and is still respected by many good players apdo for example for constantly obtainin a high soloQ rank Though he is only a mere reflection of his former self after switching to jungle Sometimes he has those rare moments of brilliance were you can see glimmers of the player he once was and he still shows he is a goo thinker But at the end of the day he ist just a shitty jungler that shows how unwilling CJ is was to change legacy players
Apparently he s trash
incredibly mediocre
How can you be pro and play for CJ Samsung if you are hat mediocre
Clearly you haven t seen S5 CJ or Samsung
Well yeah I didn t
Oh alright CJ has stuck with some very mediocre players in S5 which hurt their chances of doing better in the season That being said they still did very well for having players like Space Ambition and a well past his prime MadLife finishing 3rd in Champions Summer After all of Samsung White and Blue left for China the teams were reamade with well I d say it s the equivalent of a Coast honestly An irrelevant team that played some of the worst and most boring games in the region That s my personal opinion and I m sure there ll be a Samsung fan that will get mad at me for this opinion
I wonder just how much I ll have to bet against Samsung this season to make a profit Looking at the roster if they ever upset a team someone will become a millionaire
Amen to that my brother
I thought ambition was considered a strong mid laner Why is everyone bashing him
Hes been a jungler for a year
he s jungler and almost always top 5 in kr ladder which teams value a lot as an indicator of skill which is not wrong imho he s still a strong player ppl just like bashing him because cj underachieves truth be told samsung is shit and ppl think they can grow into a great team they wont like the same posts talk about samsung s4 teams so they really have no clue what they re talking about in term of the s5 team
He was a really good midlaner once Then got solokilled and managed to tilt off the planet all the way back onto the planet and then into the jungle
that was 3 years ago
He was but he s past his prime Still good but compared to other top laners he s prob not as good anymore
This guy must have made a deal with the devil How the fuck is he still playing
Please just retire His career ended in season 3 yet he persists
Well at least you know there s a time limit He has to enlist eventually Of course that also goes for Faker
Faker has his successors in BDD and Scout He can happily retire after he wins his third championship in season 7
We ll have to see how Scout performs during the season Looks like he needs more time in the oven right now I m not as familiar with BDD
Look him up on youtube His montages are impressive and he has a growing fanbase He is the mechanical equal to Faker He just needs some experience I d say BDD Scout but mechanics aren t what define a player
What team is he on next season
He s in the CJ org but it may be like Scout where they develop him and don t play him
Maybe he ll be their starter now that Coco is gone
Is he old enough I think he s still like 15 16
No clue
At least Solar is doing well
He will be playing as jungler right or mid
I miss the good old Samsung
sad sad i hoped that the current samsung team would keep growing and become a really strong team
Time to prove people wrong
Im sure Fury goes to another team Well now CoreJJ and Ambition are there where they belong since last season Bottom tier
If coco goes to another region wouldn t ambition be like the third or fourth best midlaner behind faker easyhoon assuming he can play like he did on blaze it feels like he can beat nagnae goong
What an ambitious move though
Well you have to agree that Samsung have ambition with this move
Not much of it clearly
I m glad Samsung has some ambition now Maybe they ll win worlds againQuas Why d you have to go and start a revolution or whatever you did to get suspended If I see Cris on this team instead of Quas I m seriously going to cry
Quas was the main reason why I liked Team Liquid Guess im gonna have to find a new team
He was also comfortably their best player I don t think this roster gets very far with a homegrown toplaner replacement Especially with C9 TSM and probably Immortals strengthening
Quas was definitely not their best player in the summer split
Quas had an overrated season last year He clearly underperformed but it can be because of the champ he had to play mostly tank ho maokai
There was also a lot of miscommunication on that team Their shotcalling and teamfighting was very disorganized Sometimes Quas would TP in the most weird positions times and it would set TL back Unsure if those TPs are on him the team or both
Same here and TSM is really hard not to like
Thanks for posting this Hi my name is Naser Empyre Al Naqi and I m the author of this article I m a freelance writer at followesports and currently working for NA s newest LCS team NRG as head analyst I wanted to talk about the possible replacements Liquid can get for top and one that could fit their current set up and team dynamic It has to be a NA resident since they already filled up their import quota so the replacement may be less than ideal Thanks for reading
I have some questions Sorry if it is a bit off topic Do you know what people in the scene think about InsanityXXX The guy has a fairly big champion pool many are high mechanical skill champions can play multiple roles and usually do pretty well in soloq Also have you heard that yusui is planning to switch back to top lane Do you think he has potential if he can grind back his mechanics
Nice try InsanityXXX Btw Insanity is 15 or 16 i think
The difficulty in evaluating someone like him in regards to competitive play is that he doesn t seem to have a certain position Most players in challenger play and stick to one position hone that one position He is one of the few that seems to be all over the place Thresh is his most played champ but he has Gragas Ryze Lee Sin Nidalee Yasuo and Zed right up there So is he a jungler Well he hasn t played jungle in 11 matches Is he a support Not if he only just plays Thresh He s not an ADC which is about all you can decipher out of him So he s probably a solo laner and just hasn t chosen a set spot Or he just doesn t care about competitive play and plays for fun It s tough to truly evaluate a player like him when he s all over the board in regards to his position He does fairly well in solo queue and he plays it a hell of a lot top 30 all season long 1300 games played on his main To get anything substantial out of him really you d have to see him stick to one position for a while and just grind it He is an interesting player though because there s not a lot of challenger players who are fill mains which it appears he is sans the ADC role
If he really is 15 16 then he should start maining a role soon and like you said grind it out and be the best in that role Definitely someone to pay attention to in the future
RIP TLs chances to qualify for worlds
getting fourth again as is tradition
They re definitely in a worse spot unless the new top turns out to be a beast Hard to imagine though
Although Zig seems to be the natural choice given that he s already in the organization that leaves a big question for what TL Academy is going to do about the empty spot TLA is doing quite well in the HTC Ascension tournament and was looking to be a strong contender for NACS Not having Zig would throw that synergy into disarray as they search for another top laner Tough situation all around for everyone involved
They ll be able to fill the spot with another challenger player easily like Brandini or BillyBoss I think
Very good article It s probably in TL s best interest to get a low economy top laner that knows how to Go relatively even in lane Funnel gold to Fenix Piglet Play utility champs and peel for the carries Zig sounds like the current 1 for the job due to his performances in the HTC tournament and the fact that he s already in the TL system Team Liquid just needs to be careful as Zig might suffer from Flaresz syndrome the fact that Zig plays a carry style in which he tries to get ahead and snowball and might have trouble adjusting to a more utility role Personally Solo fits more of the utility niche but who knows who they can pick up on such short notice
Yeah I think depending on tryouts Zig could be a solid pickup I ve also been suggested Brandini who I did not list on the article Heard mixed reviews on him
It d be cool to see TL use both Zig and Solo You could have Zig play the carry champs he s comfortable on and have Solo on tanks utillity champs Sadly it creates a pick ban where they shoehorn themselves into a certain comp but it would be interesting to see Regardless it s likely to be Zig he s on their Academy team right now anyway
Quas not like this
NA soloq top laner good luck TL
If they don t pick up Seraph i will be extremely disappointed Seraph played really good his team just had the worst luck EVER Not to mention he speaks Korean and has played with both Smoothie and Fenix
Correct me if I m wrong but I m pretty sure piglet doesn t like him so that might not work out
Seraph trolled him in Solo Q but i think that was the extent of what happened I m sure he can get over it But then again its Piglet lmao
piglet probably wouldn t
Seraph would really not fit their dynamic since he has a very carry resource focused style in comparison to the other listed Not sure how it would work out with him piglet and fenix
Seraph played with Dlift he knows how to protect the ADC lmao
Get Keane he is pretty good with weird champs
Lourlo is rly good
Quas makes me cry everytime Wish him nothing but the best in the future
Really sad situation honestly I really admire and respect the guy and sad to see him leave TL
is it confirmed that Quas is gone I thought he was just suspended and will be coming back when the split starts
Man I don t know how to feel about Liquid anymore I was hooked on Team Curse since they qualified for LCS in S3 and loved their original roster When Quas and Dom moved onto the team I loved that roster too because Dom is old school and Quas was a Swain Poppy Aatrox beast in the challenger scene I just can t see who they re gonna end up getting in NA that can come close to filling Quas s shoes and honestly I m much more interested in seeing if Quas continues to play and finds a new team
Cris GET DARIUS if you are gona get a dinossour
Cris or Hashinshin who s gunna be BOYZ
TL Zig Seraph quote me on this
I really like this author He writes really good stuff
Dyrus or flarez
they probably want a good toplaner
Cris is their best choice of the current players available considering he was the best top in NA CS Not to mention he is the only player of the ones mentioned with actual LCS experience
Not to downplay Cris strength in lane he is a really good laner but a big part of that is because he got to play carry champs in favorable matchups almost every game and Shrimp ganked top a ton That s not gonna happen in TL and Cris has traditionally been a poor low econ tank utility top For reference since joining Coast for the expansion tournament he has played Maokai 6 times with a 1 5 record Sion 3 times with a 0 3 record and Malphite once with a 1 0 record
This is also true Shrimp was the main carry on Coast
Cris is an interesting option In challenger he looks like a god but as soon as he steps on the LCS stage he goes from hero to zero Not sure if it s a mental or coaching thing
Cris deserves a shot on a good team
Cruzer plsChuchuz really doesn t solve the problem by lying to his teachers people in general instead of being upfront and saying I m a professional Gamer I ll be playing games professionally He s the perfect example for a totally normal guy and that s what most gamers are by hiding the fact he s playing video games it s literally impossible for people to see oh he s just this normal guy who plays videogames OK
Can t really blame him for that its not easy to do that especially when you are this young
of course not it s nothing personal either just not a good thing to do it s a thing we all have to get into our mindset and this won t happen overnight
PENNY BLAND I want him to have a girlfriend REKT WP Mum
Maybe it was because I m on mobile but that sentence was followed up by I want him
Was I really want him to or something close to that
there is a transcription in the link
Girlfriends are overrated just like TSM
Your comment is underrated just like Hautzer
This could have been a very patronising and under informed article but actually it came across as a decent neutral viewpoint
It s still fairly patronising but yeah it could ve been worse
Seven tried https au news yahoo com thewest video watch 29209465 video gamers descend on luna park page1 Project http tenplay com au channel ten the project extra season 7 league of legends Most of them in the Australian media end up with around the same viewpoint to really an audience who couldn t give a fuck about it
That s why Esports will never be huge in Australian culture because the public doesn t give a fuck and won t support it Instead they ll say you should be working studying The populace of our country won t back esports at this current point in time and I don t see it doing so any time soon
Australia is honestly a weird country put a ball on the field and it will be a huge following in melbourne one thing to remember is how far Australia is just in infrastructure when it comes to internet and gaming in general i get better mobile net in Norway than the best internet you can get at a household What i personally found weird is the movement against games especially violent games here as well one point to remember is that the gamers will at one point grow up and become more influential and as more money gets into e sports the greater the acceptance will be
Yeah weird that a game played for more than 100 years and played by so many people gets a huge following Honestly so weird
Fucking sportsball players fans REEEEEEEE
You can get over a 100 40 connection on mobile in Norway
last time i checked it was 80 20 so just under but still the gap is significant Which company can you get 100 40 all the ones i asked could only do 60 70
I am with skymesh They are awesome Their support staff is all young people based in Australia who are actually very helpful Also they price match their competitors I pay 79 month for 500gb downloads and unlimited uploads which is a deal from excetel I should probably say I also live in a new FTTP subdivision so I am on the NBN Seriously wish the government would roll out FTTP everywhere so gamers could enjoy the bandwidth
yeah it is pretty sad had to pay 60 dollars a month for 30 40 download pretty insane when uni internet was better
Well ignoring that Australia does not have the infrastructure hello 100 ping on a good day I honestly think the public sentiment is the same as anywhere in the western world It s just that the US and EU have more people then AUS so naturally there will be a larger audience But besides that I ld argue America s public has the same sentiment as ours The only reason people are starting to take it somewhat seriously is because of the money involved
It s a long winded trail for me but it s basically the giants at the top that don t want their media foundations to die The people at the top don t want to ever stop selling newspapers magazines and foxtel so they don t want the internet to succeed so they perpetuate the image that improving the internet is all for porn and games Don t worry though we ll be funding projects to stop the boat people for the next 50 years
Why does every news report on esports have to start with Gaming isn t just for teenagers in their bedrooms basements
because it grabs the watcher s attention if they re not too familiar with the topic also it s still the biggest stigma with eSports so it ll get used until the stigma s gone or the phrase stops working
Because that s how laymen think of gamers They will always have this image in the back of their mind while reading the article until it s been pointedly addressed It s easiest to suspend their belief in stereotypes from the get go so they ll be more receptive to an alternative image as the article progresses
Probably because someone who never heard of esports wouldn t now Edit fixed spelling
k ftfy
Well I play on my desk which is in my bedroom
Because we ll have to wait until these ancient writers are in their graves and the younger generation take over Only then will the stigma be gone Fuck em
ever check twitter after something esports y gets put on a big network like ESPN that s why
Welp at least it wasn t as bad as that Daily Mail article Sauce http www dailymail co uk news article 3017401 The girls glory videogames America s nerds infiltrating South Korea s surreal million dollar world gaming bedroom geeks transformed heartthrobs html
err I hate dailymail so much They had always annoyed me with their articles with information taking out of context As a pharmacy student they ve done that so many times with drug related articles bringing fear to England for no legit reasons
Love the url
like I play a lot of lol and my mom hates this game because of this Every time I bring a bad mark home 3 in Germany with 1 being the best she thinks that it s because I play too much and waste my time on a game instead of learning That s like the only problem I have with my mom it s a family conflict an argument because she simply won t understand that blaming video games is not the right thing to do maybe I just won t understand that playing video games is evil tl dr First World Problems
It depends what you think the real problem is Do you feel that more time studying would help you If yes then yes its hurting Or do you feel that its helping you relax so if you stopped or did less it would make your grade worse Or are you studying enough but still struggling In that case you need to find a better way to study Deep down you should know why you are struggling It just takes looking at it objectively to help My struggle was I had a hard time remembering It wasn t that I was spending too much time gaming but just that I crammed too much If I redistributed my time it would be fine But all of that is up to the individual
Well she s not wrong If you studied more you d probably get a 1
Studying more and Playing LoL are not mutually exclusive This is his problem the cause of the bad grades isn t the game it s just not studying enough
Mhmmm
I wish everyone in the world had Australian accents
Was there when they got some footage of the viewing party in Sydney Seemed pretty chill about the whole thing
One of the least patronising report on Esports I know it was ABC Aus but Oce isn t exactly the best region to do a report on Hardly anyone watches our pro scene
Because your region is like a tiny percentage of the rest of the regions There s like 40m people in Oce whereas EU has over 750m and NA has close to 600m It s not until you look at the numbers that you realise how insignificant Oce is
Doubt there is 40m people playing on OCE when Australia population is 24m and New Zealand is like 3m or something Lots of Indonesia don t actually play on OCE
I never said there was 40m players There s 40m people
I think the word you are looking for is accounts
What No The population of the Oceanic region is 40m people Is this hard to understand I dont think it is considering I listed the population of europe and NA too
That s probably because no one really uses Oceania to talk about the geographic region I mean sure technically Melanesia Micronesia and Polynesia are part of Oceania but how many of them speak English let alone play League so what s the point in referencing the population
To give a comparison for the size of the region
There s a not insignificant amount of Chinese Vietnamese players who play on our server I think I ve played with more New Caledonians than Indonesians
Fijians too
That Ryze Renekton botlane tho
Austalian ABC talks about e sports Spanish ABC talks about how bad masturbation is and what can you do to prevent it
Seriously Lmao what year is it
esports isnt going to work in australia
i think that gaming should stay at where it is now because in my opinion i wouldn t like if gaming starts being controlled by BAD People like many companies in real life are
I don t understand your point Isn t it every year there is always some drama about some shaddy org that isn t playing it s players correctly The more popular it gets the less this will happen hopefully
The bad is already here in fact the bad has already been there I mean the E T game for the Atari comes to mind or any of the 5 386 games that came out in the early 90 s And now we have giants like E A and Ubisoft that have pretty bad releases with AAA titles
wow we still sweaty nerds just now living in our mum s basements ok abc
Thanks for the cringe fest ABC
It wasn t that bad keeping in mind that this is for the people who have no idea about this
too bad oce is BY FAR the worst region lmfao
Nice joke For the IWC events that gave qualification for worlds we always get into the finals and then choke
hahaha
australia esports lol pfft nice jokeIf I had to guess who Xerath Ziggs Lux Brand Vel Koz Malzahar Anivia Those first three in particular are guaranteed to see changes they all have very very similar gameplay and strategies Same deal with Vel Koz and Brand somewhat interchangeable combo mages The marksmen update was radically different from the juggernauts in terms of scale Every single champion in the class was touched upon except the very recently released Kindred So I can t really predict how many mages will be changed it could be anywhere between three and a dozen depending on how broadly they define the subclass Item changes are a strong possibility as well There will probably be a few surprising changes to champions like Orianna who arguably need no changing like Kog Maw who was unique even before his rework
Cho gath mains around the world are quiet in hoping we get forgotten
Is it just me or do Chogath mains never have a super bad game I ve never seen a chogath feed or super lose lane
Cho doesn t really have any bad matchups
He used to Good luck top against Illaoi It s realllllll bad Source I m a D4 Cho main whose asshole is still bleeding after getting rekt by a gold Illaoi Though in my defense I wasn t quite sure how her spells worked at that point
It s extremely hard for lanes to kill him even if they have a lot of kill pressure Cho s sustain is massive and he can instakill waves with his aoe combo and basically once he has catalyst you can t damage him faster than he can regen off of waves He pretty much forces any lane he s in to turn into a farm lane unless you put in a lot of gank pressure
I love playing into him as Jax for this reason I d imagine anyother hypercarry that just wants to sit back farm and outscale would like it too
you can zone him off the cs and he is mana gated like mad But only certain champs are able to do that and it almost always opens you up to jungle ganks
He s a farm lane He has sustain poke high damage and high tankiness He s also snowbally with his ultimate stacks and so doesn t honestly do much if he doesn t get his ult stacks because he can t tank huge amounts without it His poke is a hard to hit and misses most of the time anyway because it s visuals are really screwed up
Cho Gath is almost definitely a juggernaut Melee with no mobility and very high damage tankiness
Although he s also high CC which most Juggernauts are not But yeah while he can be built as an immobile mage he definitely doesn t fall into the same category as the ones mentioned overall
He s closer to the tank role than anything else he just happens to have great ratios and is played heavy ap He s basically a relic of champion design where tanks needed to do a ton of burst damage to be considered threats thus take the brunt of focus to start out a fight
Cho has CC out of his ass and is classified as a tank by Riot themselves His high damage is just a result of his abnormally high ancient AP ratios
Noone ever remembers poor Zyra
I fucking hate roaming when I m Zyra mid so slow I could die
You probably will Watch out for river crab he can one shot you
or syndra
Syndra is amazing wtf
But so is brand and lux
I ll throw Vel Koz into the mix very underrated as I find him to be a more reliable Brand
yeah the koz has always been very good and on the border of being strong imo he s actually really good at the moment because games rarely go past 3 items now which is his peak That and the ap item changes a while back helped him reach his already fast power spikes even quicker He also fits in to pretty much any team comp Good at poking good at taking objectives good at siege good at picks good at teamfights good at disengage Only thing he s kinda bad at is all in comps but even then he can clean up for the team with ult
I use him for support right now So free Poke q is cheap and then his lvl 2 is strong Then hit 6 and you melt them with basic spelltheifs
and u got a leona kalista lane against and you are fucked
Or Alistar
Anivia has one of the highest winrates in the game I ve been playing her since S2 hope they don t touch her too much
and malz almost all of them have always had positive win rates
No shes not She is a snowball champ who s Q tickles you at rank 1 and 2 You can land 3 early Q s and get hit by one brand w and he did more damage than you Her later game however is still pretty solid but by that time people have items or ways to negate her ultimate
Donno why you got down voted shits true If you miss any skills early you re going to run out of mana Not to mention all the counter play that s been introduced to her ekko kindred tahm
This is probably the time frame they were referencing weeks months ago about her changes The class as a whole is getting wrapped up together it seems With how much the pre season has relieved a lot of her pain points it s likely they re considering her a minor update pass mostly just to fix her passive
And even less people remember Karthus c
Zyras kit is unique though She doesn t really need a rework just QoL buffs
her passive needs a rework 50 of damage that deal after death is not right way She need some sort of photosynthesis passive that interact with plants at some way
I ve been saying this for ages I don t care what they do to her but she really needs a complete new passive This one is bad both thematically and gameplay wise if you play a perfect game you basically played a champion with no passive if you die you have a slow unresponsive skillshot Also the plants need a real ai fix
I still dont get why Heimerdinger got the hp regen aura for allies and not her
Because that passive is a relic of a kit designed 6 years ago
I d love it if Ziggs was made into less of a long range siege mage because it really doesn t fit his theme He has this whole aggressive impatient short fuse character archetype and all he does in game is stand 2 screens away waveclearing like a pussy and dragging games out to 50 minutes Maybe give him a reason to use Satchel Charge offensively because I ve never seen it happen
Ziggs needs more knockups He s not nearly disruptive enough for a guy throwing bombs everywhere It d be hilarious if all 4 of his spells had knockups or displacement effects even if some of them were really small like Quinn s Vault
Yasuo s best friend
Except then your forced to run yasuo top really and there are a lot of bad matchups up there for him the only reason IMO to play yasuo top is as a counter pick
If Ziggs had 4 knockups he would be a valid support
Yasuo bot like my boy QTPIE
freelo baby
It doesn t fit his personality but I feel like being siege oriented definitely fits his explosives theme
I think agressively sieging would be a cool interesting niche for him
Leave my Vel koz alone He is perfectly fine maybe do smthing about space aids Malzahar Anivia Karthus Brand Fiddle and Zyra But leave my Vel koz
If we see something like they did with marksmen they will probably just make all the mages fit a specific role split push dueling siege map control etc I can honestly see them just hitting Vel s passive in a way His main niche aside from that is wave clear and distanced harass something already achieved by virtually all other mages I can see them tweaking Vel to be the anti tank resistances mage with his passive
Did somebody say MAX HEALTH TRUE DAMAGE
Riot should do smthing about Annie cuz that shit nukes harder than USA did in WWII without any fucking item
They need to change Annie s R into a flying hot marshmallow projectile something like Corki s new Q So at least I get a chance to dodge it and not get 50 of my hp donezo
Or at least fix the stun so that if I flash I should not be stunned but take no damage It s either take stun damage and no flash goes off or I flash and I take no stun or damage Make up your mind riot
Man I usually didn t play against Annie in mid lane but I played the match up awhile ago Who the fuck let that bitch get mana refunded on Q She free farms and is able to freely stack her stun Wtf is this shit
Malz is my freelo machine Please don t touch him I swear if they gut the ad on voidlings I m going to be so salty
I hope they don t touch Lux in the slightest
Honestly despites her mana problems she is in a very very good spot right now
Honestly her E s mana cost is what keeps her from being completely broken With just a Luden s Echo and 2 Doran s rings she can blip out half of most mid laners HP in a single E
dont forget the funny fact that e aa procs thunderlord poke is hilarious
Im so scared right now So very scared
I could stand for some minor buffs like a lower E cost but I also know I m biased She was in a pretty good place during the Juggernaut meta and I think that showed she can still be viable I just really hope they don t decide that she s too strong
Karthus says hi
Karthus doesn t need a rework in my opinion But he may get small changes too
Yea I can see that his kit is the type to get changed but I don t think he needs the changes that badly
Personally I d like to see an option to see the full range of his Q or make it more intuitive to use
Or just allow us to fucking normal cast without clicking the bloody icon
Using quick cast button allows you to normal cast Karthus Q It s flipped for him and cass Not sure why you would want to normal cast Karthus Q though
Riot has mentioned Syndra and Zyra for changes they just haven t been able to figure out what to do I d imagine they would make the list for March rework
I have to admit the two main reasons I play Lux are her laugh and extreme range which helps make up for my mediocre positioning a bit so I hope they keep those parts of her kit And her laser of course Have to secure kills somehow
Her laugh Some people just want to watch the world burn
I for one think her laugh is adorable
Seconded I have no idea why there are people who can t stand it I d listen to it all day if I could
Lulu mains say hi
Wouldn t be so sure about Xer Ziggs Vel Koz and Lux The most obvious one to me is Malzahar The dude s desperate for a rework Uninteractive kit frusterating to play against etc everything checks in Brand will get some changes too for sure Anivia may be in line but I m really not sure about the others Malza is 100 though
Anivia is fine as a champ I think Super high skill ceiling good at teamfighting and sieging and turtling Honestly the only thing that holds her back are item costs right now
Malabar has a pretty unique kit though and not everyone hates playing against him Xerath and Ziggs however fill the same spot of good waveclear poke from long range
What kind of person enjoys being autopushed whole game and deleted at lvl 6 with no reaction
The joys of late game where you get to close to space aids minions and lose 50 hp
I do want Meddler to answer about Zhonyas being so damn expensive and nerfing the numbers on the item though It s just unbelievable that every AD gets benefit but Zhonyas got the dick and a fuck you
For the record BT got 5 less AD and costs like 200 more gold
But the Zhonya s nerf makes it so awkward to build You never build it if you re snowballing so increasing the price just means that the people getting shit on by ad mids get shit on even harder And the 5 armor didn t help at all either I play a ton of heimerdinger and even though the active is amazing on him I can t afford to build it without falling behind
BT is just as awkward to build now It has 3 components but still you probably only have room for 2 by the time you want to build it if you are lucky so that leaves you with a 1150 350 1500g cost Awkward isnt it
there is like 5 other lifesteal options out there anyway
Considering how badly AD casters assassins got shafted by the changes non crit itemization and LW I m not sure why paying for Zhonya s active is actually an issue For years we were picking it up because it was a 120AP items with really good stats that just happened to also have one of the best actives in the game That was especially true pre Luden s when Zhonya s was the only other power item for champions who couldn t use DFG
You know what else is funny Zhonya and Deathcap used to be the same item That s so absurd in retrospect
I started playing in early S2 so I didn t get to see some of the ridiculous shit like Zhonya s Ring or Innervating Locket but it s pretty weird to look back at how crazy some of the items and game features used to be
Innervating Locket on Udyr Soraka Sona Gragas back when Gragas W also restored mana with no cost plus 4 Philo Stones SUSTAIN FOR DAYS BEAR WITNESS
I remember when I started playing support on Alistar and Blitz Kage s Lucky Pick Heart of Gold Philosopher s Stone and as many wards as I could buy RIP
it s still there wooglet s witchcap in 3 s and dominion
Seriously Fuck me as a Kennen player right
I hope they don t touch Vel Koz he s in a very good spot
Just get him out of my bot lane i am tired of watching my AD carry doing his best impression of a hentai chick edit 69 upvotes strangely appropriate don t ruin it guys
The fact that games are quicker means he can deal stupid amounts of damage with just ayhenes morellos sorc shoes and haunting guise If you have those three items you should be melting pretty much anyone at the 30 minute mark
Especially since the game is so tank and adc focused now Just stay in the back and channel an ult and get 30 to 50 percent of the enemy teams health down
as a support
That s the secret You don t play Vel Koz Support You play Vel Koz Support
Kinda like Brand support
You get it
If he wards and let me farm he can play and build whatever the fuck he wants honestly
30 to 50 isn t even that close to the actual dmg he does with ult
Yeah more like 70
Ayyyhenes
I feel he s in a rather balanced state right now There s counterplay to him but if left alone he can carry games on his own Has clear strengths and exploitable weaknesses Really hope Riot has nothing huge planned for him
I still think Vel Koz is the most balanced champion they ve ever released He s gone so long with so few changes and always been not too strong not too weak
You mean insanely powerful but no one realises it so only the mains use him and completely destroy everything in their path
Are they even in a bad spot Lux Vel Koz Brand Syndra Viktor etc are all doing quite well The only thing that sucks were the ap item cost increases
Its not that they are in a bad spot but rather that some of them are quite same y kit wise For example Lux and Xerath or Brand and Malzahar The goal is the same as the marksman update make champions more distinctive
But theyre not the same at all Saying lux is xerath because theh both have long range nukes or brand is malzahar because they both have DoT is just it goes way deeper Brand has no point and click suppress and lux cant kill creep waves with one spell
Brand and Malz are bad examples but Lux and Xerath are really similar Both try and poke with a skill repeatedly until they catch you with their skillshot CC ability to land a reliable combo and kill you OR use their ults to pick off targets that are low and far away
I d actually compare lux to vel koz rather then xerath tbh Lux combo involves her catching someone with q then using e and ult and to blow them up while vel holds people in place with e and blows them up with the rest of his kit In both cases ult is more of a nuke that s reliable as compared to xerath s ult Amusingly both of them have part of their passive that makes them want to be in auto range for more damage lux passive damage and vel extending duration of passive stacks in spite of that being a poor idea at best Even so there are differences between the two Vel has better waveclear and is relatively more mobile faster movespeed wise and can cast some spells while moving and is more early mid game team fight oriented by virtue of not having as good ap ratios and stronger aoe kit wise
Not after the 20s ulti CD nerf
Yo let s give Fiddlesticks some love
FiddleWithSticks2016
fidd is not immobile m8 have you ever seen his ult s
StickLivesMatter
Ult can only be cast when using E Casting ult teleports you to the crow from E Boom done
My guess is the actual awkward mages Fiddlesticks Zyra Swain Galio Teemo Malzahar Litterally immobile mage champions that are nt a long range waveclear poke champ neither burst champions but awkward mid range champ with low stats because if they were viable they would be OP in the right hands of a main The only reason for riotgames to change Brand Ziggs Anivia Vel koz Xerath etc would be to change their identity and playstyle to spice things up without having to add another champion to fill that role I feel that these champions have unique attributes but still kind of overlapps each other in terms playstyle
Please don t gut teemo more He s already beaten to a pulp with the shroom duration nerf
He also replied to the question Is Lulu part of the immobile mages this http boards na leagueoflegends com en c gameplay balance ojUfPUvE riot is lulu part of the immobile mages comment 0001 She is not If we do decide to tackle immobile mages next we ll also be looking at AP casters who are primarily damage focused rather than damage utility mixes like Lulu Anivia Morgana etc I imagine that Brand Fiddlesticks Malzahar Swain Ziggs Veigar are on the line Maybe Syndra as well In theory Orianna and Lux would be part of the dmg utility mix mages and would not be touched
You can add Xerath too His CCs are not primarily and he only gets picked because of his poke damage No reason to pick Xerath over Anivia Orianna Lux if you want utility
Yeah you are right I forgot about him It is kind of funny how about a year ago people were saying why would you pick Lux over Xerath she deals no dmg And now it is pretty much the other way around and she is very strong in Soloq
If you give annie a dash I am quitting league forever
When her passive is up she ll get an auto flash before her next spell
They murdered my baby Kog in both AD and AP builds they better murder the demon child as tribute
New Passive for all immobile champs Flash has reduced range but now has a 3 second cd and is renamed to Limp
My babe Zyra gets no respect EVER
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS GOOD FIX THAT DEMON CANCER CHILD ANNIE
If they simply gave her Tibber s a 0 75 sec throw animation similar to Orianna s Shockwave I think it would put her in a better spot
If Tibbers had a cast animation she would be unreliable on top of her squishiness lack of mobility and ridiculously low range She would be garbage tier with zero reason to pick her over any other mage
Just something for counterplay would be nice She is such a horrible champion to play against unless you re a tank if you re ever within flash tibbers range you just die lol
she shouldn t be able to pocket stun forever
I think just removing the 100 mana refund on her q would remove most of the annoyance in her laning But still her damage has to be changed somehow It s all completely unavoidable without predictionary invulnerability
Please don t touch my Lux Yes she s immobile but she makes up for it with her long range and utility And blowing up the carries is so satisfying Actually landing her skillshots is rewarding You can lower the mana cost on her E tho That s k
Meanwhile as a support main I want to see buffs for our stats based on utility so that mages that aren t top tier can stay the fuck out of my lane I m tired of my adc feeding support LeBlancs and other cheesy shit Like holy fuck can you farm safely while I put down a ward and not get yourself killed during that 10 or so seconds
pls calm down nami
No dammit Riot won t give me moonstones
I know your pain all too well those mages are even making my bananas peel
Supports are the brains of bot lane When they go B the adc will immediately attempt to dive 1v2 It is known
Malzahar probably most in need of a rework I hope they make him into a micro intensive champion who can control his units Or like a Warlock from WoW
If Malzahar and Galio don t get changed I will be very surprised They are the definition of win lane lose game champions among mid laners
I don t think Galio is part of this class
I honestly don t know what class galio belongs to
Special ed
primary Tank secondary Support He s got a slow a strong armor MR buff a speed boost and taunt and has good base damage but doesn t scale as well with AP
I don t think you ve actually played against a good Malzahar before Most beginning Malzahars are incredibly conservative with their ult It s why they seem to have such little impact
yeah hes my favorite champ and ive seen tons of people just make really bad decisions with him also not using e makes me facepalm
Ah they re probably going to be rolling Syndra s passive changes into the immobility update Makes sense it s after preseason so they can do evaluations too
Old Xerath s W as an active on an item mark my words
cass buffs pls
This would be nice With such short games her passive and tear roa don t stack all the way often And I love being a snek
snek pls
I really hope they don t touch Anivia She s in a fantastic spot right now and probably has my favorite play style ever
I m not a drinking man and I hope Meddler keeps me that way I liked the Quinn changes but I still don t have faith in this
You better not touch Orianna
They won t Any time there s a who is the most balanced well designed whatever champion thread what s the most common response Ori
I m ready for Swain to finally receive an update One can dream
he has nerfs on the pbe
why
fucked if I know apparently raka is fine but god forbid swain have a 2 second super telegraphed snare
Him and vlad were my main champs last season they made it so anyone can get grevious wounds which already nerfed them now this 1
The DOT mastery is crazy good on him right now that s the only thing I can think of
And just win Quas isn t playing too
rip malzahar faithful partner for 5 seasons
Hopefully spellvamp will become a relevant stat as well
It would be incredibly hard to balance If you don t reduce vamp on aoe then aoe mages will get incredible sustain compared to mages with little to no aoe WoTA is already like a Death s Dance for mages but I suppose they could make the aoe reduction slightly less
I hope not and I hope lifesteal gets nerfed as well Shrugging off every poke champion shuts down all kinds of strategies and champion kits I could see them giving it to the blue elixir though Making it temporary costly but somewhat strong while you have it would feel good I think
Oh god please dont touch lux
And the OP rotations countinue
I hope Riot don t change Vel koz too much I really like the calamari so much right now
What the fuck Where s TF at
Please Zyra T T
Will Syndra finally have a real passive
Yay finally we can have more passives on old mages I d like a passive blind on Lux if she procs her light passive on a champion some times in a row he gets blinded OR just hear her laugh everytime she kills you
The AD carries that got significant changes e g Graves Cait Kog were changed to become really fun if this means champs like Brand or Zyra get kits that are less bland then I m all for it
Exactly It s not necessarily just buffs or nerfs or balance changes It s changing their playstyles so they each feel more unique I m all for that A lot of mages right now are kinda bleh in their play styles Brainless and or boring
As long as we don t get another patch like the juggernaut patch I m already lucky to have survived that
They were 4 obsolete champions and went to OP after the update Heres the thing though 1 2 months after they are balanced except Morde which is a success from the garbage state they were before Juggernaut update being a failure is stupid argument
That specific patch was a mistake Skarner had a 65 win rate He was actually by no contest the best champion in the game during that patch Darius had a 90 ban rate for 2 months straight after the patch Also after the Marksman changes I would consider the Mordekaiser rework a failure He s completely useless right now
What do you mean He had a 75 winrate just like he always did
You mean his 85 winrate
I think you made a typo it should say 95
Skarner won every game he was in and 5 of the games he wasn t in
It actually was 65 at his peak If there is a way to go back the patch would include his pre and post hotfix winrates so it wouldn t be completely accurate but he peaked at 65
It was definitely 65 at his height
I m pretty sure that he actually held a 65 win rate for the first patch I remember getting on champion gg and being shocked by how high it was
Why Darius and Skarner are fine atm and Garen is fine for the type of champion they want him to be most easy champ in the game so a good choice for newcomers but is exploitable at high level games Only Morde rework went bad and im still hoping that they will find a way to make it work tune him in a way he wont be either god or trash Hes my go to champ when im forced to ADC and the only alternative to the role
To be fair as soon as they were released all of them were insanely strong barring Garen who was just extremely annoying Skarner anbd Darius were hotfixed Mordekaiser GP 100 more or less pick or banned at worlds Fiora being incredibly broken etc Now I m not saying that it was the worst thing riot has ever done it s nice to spice up things and I actually enjoyed it but I can see why people don t want to go through that again
The thing is that updates like these aim to the long run The goal is to diversify the champion pool which may come at the expense of some champs being OP for a period of time The timing of Riot was bad deciding to be played at Worlds with zero pro matches played in that patch before but that was not a decision made by the balance update team OP champs existed and will exist anyway
I agree with you I loves it when the Juggernauts came round so I m definitely looking forward to what happens to the mages after the success of the marksman changes
Umm Darius was buffed
I personally feel like immobile Mages need some kind of counterplay to being completely rushed walked all over With so much mobility it feels almost impossible in some circumstances to kite zone out the enemy
This may be out of topic but immobile or not they sure could do something with Karma too 6 seasons in a row and she s still a champion that hardly shines sees mid tier placements and is just overall a pick that has not stand out a lot often
Orianna immobile as shit You won t waste W early game due huge mana cost Reasonable W spamming damage dealt per mana used is reliable after 8 10lvl Just make AP items cheapier and we re happy
Its pretty funny reading through this thread how so many champs get mentioned as needing help then the next comment saying they re fine but this other champ needs work instead I think this is a really challenging update beucase mages are naturally a lot more individually varied in their mechanics even though they can have such similar patterns Marksmen all have the right click targeted auto attack to do dmg aspect and while there is some variation vayne has 3 hit kalista has rend etc at the core its all the same though riot is changing it a bit more drastically with graves update Mages by definition focus on their spells which cannot all be the same exact thing the way auto s are This leads to mages naturally being more varied even if people complain that some are practically the same If you take into account all the aspects of a champion individual spell mechanics kit play pattern theme character feel etc theres a lot there for players to get into enjoy and get attached to so i think that updating and changing mages as a whole will be a lot harder to do without disappointing and distancing a lot more players than with the marksmen update
As someone who mainly plays immobile mages Read Vel Koz Anivia Syndra Orianna Veigar Malzahar Swain and Xerath I am shuddering In fear Especially since Orianna Anivia and Vel Koz have been mostly untouched over time Then again the void guy hasn t been around for as long as Anivia and Orianna and Orianna was hit by a barrage a few seasons ago
I would really like a small change to anivia I think her kit is really nice but her mana costs phew without mana pots it s even more noticable and her q is super slow for a 1 sec stun I mean the radius is pretty nice but with all those mobile champs she has a bit of a hard time But I think in General it s just her mana costs and maybe her attackdmg attackspeed ratioNot Cpt Jack im sad
Hopefully another team will pick him up and he ll actually be able to play I used to get so frustrated when jin air used to lose game after game after game when pilot was ONLY playing corki and yet they kept him in Pilot turned out to be pretty good but I was sad my boy jack was sitting the bench Hopefully no longer
He tweeted a few weeks ago he is doing uni
Too bad although probably the safer choice Thanks for the update
Yeah him and one other person
Cpt Jack can now be with his soulmate Faker
SKT Cpt Jack in top lane confirmed Trolling all the way into worlds with Bard mid
The loss of Chaser is huge Jin Air s newer players like Kuzan and SoHwan really needed that in game guidance that Chaser could have provided and Winged doesn t look up to this task He was in my opinion the best jungler in Korea this past year in spite of the Cinderhulk hiccup at the end of Champions Spring
The real question for me is where is Chaser going I m thinking china or the IM roster but theres some millionaires that are buying some teams in NA too so I wanna see how it works out
Just a question I dont follow the LCK scene Why does everyone say that IM is gonna be really good Weren t they near the bottom last year
I think they got a bunch of funding from somewhere People think they are going to assemble a mega squad
Longzhu chinese sponsor they throwin a TON of for IM to put together an Incredible team
Marin top Chaser T0M jungle Easyhoon mid Picaboo support Cpt Jack adc oh lord
cpt jack has been average for two entire seasons now id rather see imp deft or pray on that team
Or Ohq
yesss najin just released him
Fury might be the more likely option Samsung signed CoreJJ so it s possible he s just a backup but it s also possible they know they re going to lose Fury
When do Imp s Deft s and Pray s contracts expire
not even sure but not for a while and the buyout clauses are probably super expensive
Imp also said that he has no intentions of leaving China
both Deft and Imp are known to stay in China
Make it Deft or Pray and I m in
Don t you talk lowly of my Cpt Jack
Deft is one of the few korean pros that are content in LPL
imp would be good to make up for the passive midlane God if this team happens OGN would be a lot interesting to say the least
Yeah this past year was quite frankly pretty boring either GET or SKT smashing most opposition with SKT s slight hiccup of losing to global CJ comp I started watching LPL over LCK actually it got so stale
Agreed I only watched OGN when Doa was on last split No offense to papa smithy he s good but the games in general aren t that enjoyable compared to the past when there are legit 5 6 strong decent teams
Yeah hopefully some new blood teams like IM end up showing up big and hopefully for me CJ picks up
Spirit would be good if not better He fills a somewhat similar role to Chaser in the carry oriented style and he has all the experience I think Imp would do well in that roster as well Hopefully LGD can disband or let some players go because it seems their talent is really not being used to its potential
Imp sadly already stated that he wouldnt leave LGD because he was making to much money Gotta get the green
Man Those weird ass watches and tee shirts are too appealing I guess That and a stable financial future but who cares about that when you got Imp swag
SKT Redux
Basically SKT T1 S Reloaded
Marin Chaser Easyhoon Fury Picaboo is the best team you can make from koreans still in korea
Marin Chaser Coco Ohq Piccaboo
Christ that made me wet
We got our S6 champs already

IM is a korean team Just chinese sponsor Longzhu That s why they re Longzhu IM
IM is a Korean team
Their Chinese sponsor Longzhu is rumored to investing a LARGE sum of money into the team Which is good and bad because I feel bad for Frozen and IgNar who are pretty good and deserve to be in better teams
they got more money from longzu and vowed to make a better team
China knows they can t win through LPL so they put money in the team they sponsor in LCK Longhzu IM basically it s a team with China s money but LCK level that s why it is so hyped I just hope that they will be able to live up to the hype
There was a rumor at IEM that he was going to Fnc
I think he deserves Chinese salary considering he s the best Korean jungler atm Would be completely reasonable
Best Korean jungler isn t saying much there was no competition in the jungle role this season in LCK
That s a bit of an exaggeration there mate Chaser Bengi and Score all looked pretty good Sure it s not the DanDy and KaKAO show like it was last year but give them some credit
They are all tier 2 at best if we re talking about world class talent though which was my point
I disagree with you on Bengi I think he s criminally underrated But that s the beauty of opinions we can all have them Good points
Fair enough
Considering the showing of t1 jungler at worlds Clearlove Kakao and lets say Bengi why wouldnt it be possible for some to drop and others to rise a tier
If they are tier 2 junglers then Kakao Spirit are tier 5 jungler for getting consistently dumped on by Clearlove Hell even Santorin and Hai did well against those guys
You have to look at teams as well that said I realize my opinion is unpopular however I stand by it
Bengi wit dat tier 2 double world championship title
Chaser was better than Spirit in 2014
Chaser is probably a top 3 jungler in the world without a doubt top 5 Eve was also pretty good on a team with utter shit top and a meh mid
Hey man you really seem to know your Jin Air stuff Can you tell me what you think of Capt Jack I always felt he was a great player but just super bad luck The meta never seemed to favor him Thanks in advance Edit Thanks for the dv s for asking a real question
Not OP but I m pretty huge on Jin Air so I guess I can offer my two cents Cpt Jack was always a great player with keen game sense His teamfighting was pretty darn good Jack has what a lot of people underestimate experience He knows what needs to be done for a game to be carried and on top of that his mechanics and nerves are top notch A lot of people don t realize it cuz you can t see something that isn t there but Cpt Jack doesn t choke His decisive shotcalling was part of what made Jin Air Stealths game so fun to watch that and Trace s off meta picks Chaser s astute jungling Fly s raw mechanical prowess Chei s playmaking ability Jack s Blaze days may not have been as bright as his Stealths days wherein he was the main carry of the team other than his Cleanse highlight reels but he knew exactly what he was to the team that team which looked unbeatable during Spring 2013 He was part of that And he ll always have my respect even if he was never rated the best ADC in OGN
I ve loved Cpt Jack since he was on Blaze in 2012 While I understood that Pilot was a safer choice who used slightly fewer resources I enjoyed Cpt Jack s time on Jin Air especially when he was on the 2014 Stealths He and Chei were a fun and aggressive lane and Chei on disengage supports really worked with his proactive playstyle They were my favorite bot lane for Jin Air to run as opposed to XD and Pilot Regardless of his most recent history which is less than successful and involves a stretch of time where he was more of a substitute there s no doubt that Cpt Jack had a huge influence on Korean LoL and is a legacy player As far as I know Cpt Jack did announce that he d be attending university next year so I m unsure as to whether he ll continue playing LoL If he retires he should still be considered an incredibly influential player
Yeah thus the bad luck I was mind blown why the keep playing Pilot
Piloting Corki
Something needed to be done anyway Jin Air were insanely boring to watch They did nothing for 50 min then hoped to win the last teamfight
Awww you are back to deleting all your posts sad

Do not worry they still have Their Pilot
Seeing Cpt Jack leave the lol scene is pretty sad his stream was always pretty fun to watch and I thought it was great how he interacted with his english viewers he seems like a very smart person so I m sure he ll be just fine one of my favorite lol personalities
did he used to speak english to viewers
He would reply in broken english pretty nice from him fun stuff too
He can speak understandable English I used to play with him on NA before KR servers existed and he could communicate fine
What means he s leaving the LoL scene
I dont know if hes leaving the LoL scene or not but a lot of people were saying over the past month that this was expected something about Cpt Jack getting into a good university or something like that
Susie Kim tweeted that Cpt Jack is going to university now
5 4 acceptance rate holy shit That s even lower than Yale 6 4 and Harvard 5 9
I have a hard time believing that a university that s not even one of the Seoul Big 3 SKY is harder to get into than Harvard or Yale
Most people will never bother to apply to Harvard or Yale that keeps their acceptance rate fairly high compared to what it would be if they received applications in the droves that average state schools receive them Hell Harvard rejects students that they ask to apply
I feel like it would be the opposite as in a lot of people with a decent score apply there for the hell of it Chung Ang is also a private school like Harvard and Yale but it s only a top 10 school without quite the level of prestige that the SKY universities have
Wasn t there some uni league program he joined
Was it a league program I didnt know that but that makes sense All i had heard on twitter was stuff like Expecting Cpt Jack to retire he got accepted to university
Maybe I remember someone different but there were 2 Korean pros admitted into a uni league program by a Seoul university maybe it was cpt jack but could ve been someone else
This
Jin Air is pretty boned now That s a huge part of their roster This is a massive loss
i dont hthink its a huge blow in the ADC role since they still have PIlot right
True but Pilot still needs to grow in terms of decision making He pushes out far alone a lot and Cpt Jack was supposed to be his mentor It s not good he left means he s gonna have to learn all that shit on his own Although it probably says something that Pilot never learned after all this past year with Cpt Jack
yeah its been hella long since Pilot and CptJack been together
Losing their 2 best player is still huge As for Pilot he certainly has a lot of potential
I think everyone figured Chaser would leave after they said he couldn t play at IEM due to wrist issues Wonder where they will go I know Lustboy said a lot of Korean roster changes would come out tonight
I said wrist injuries and I was memeing the RO situation just in case people actually think he has wrist injuries since I keep getting messages about it
I have a feeling the IM super roster is going to be home of Chaser
Maybe but what about Spirit
I think Chaser is higher regarded than Spirit currently but I can see that changing if Spirit gets onto a better team again
Really I rate Spirit on a different level than Chaser
I think a lot of people remember what he was at IEM last year and think he maintained that imho that wasn t the case and Chaser had emerged as the only player in the world that could emulate Dandy s switch hitting style of jungle play aggressive ganker vs map control counter ganker Chaser is really really good and tbh he was the only standout jungler by the end of S5 Spirit I think can and probably will eclipse him given the correct team but as of now Chaser ended S5 much stronger
Spirit fell off super hard while on WE while Chaser showed that he was the best jungler in Korea Spirit is a risk as a top jungler at this point while Chaser you are 100 getting one barring injury falling off
I d say Spirit is all around better but purely in terms of carry junglers I think Chaser and Rush are better
As do I A slightly lower one
No offense to Spirit but I think Chaser holds a bit more value for IM to go after considering how well he s been doing
CJ Or maybe the Tigers finally get rid of their whole friendship theme and ditch Hojin
I don t see why they d ditch their friendship theme It got them to worlds
It s a double edged sword they had sick teamplay but they were held back by the individual weaknesses in their players
They came second and won a game against SKT I wouldn t say they were held back by antyhing
I mean considering the competition it was clear they wouldn t get exposed The only teams that gave any of the KR teams a struggle were OG and each other Worlds just showed that KR is still ahead and that the gap between the West still exist
I think there s both a pro and a con to staying the same Obviously chemistry takes time to build so going into a new year with an intact line up is good On the other hand if Korea turns into an arms race particularly with some of the Chinese exodus players returning can you afford to stand pat whIle your rivals amass elite talent
Chinese teams amassed lots if raw talent and look where it got them Granted there s plenty of other stuff like language and coaching issues to think about but I think that bringing in new talent will not have a positive enough impact to offset the setback to their insane chemistry as a team
I think you just covered the two reasons why they could make it work The returning elite talent is Korean therefore no language barrier Also NoFe is one of the top tier coaches Again I am not promoting the Tigers to make a roster change I just said there were obvious pros and cons With other Korean teams restocking their roster it won t be easy to repeat their season 5 success
Yeah they beat a bunch of western teams so good I m just saying the potential skill ceiling could raise a lot higher if they upgraded individual players but I guess they re fine as is until a team besides KT and SKT test them
Tigers are sponsor less are they not And Spirit is quite coveted
I heard they have sponsorships lined up They are just choosing right now
Cant wait for the announcement with the money they have they can pick a superstrong line up on paper
This is devastating as a Jin Air fan

IIRC crazy Jin Air Inven Fan stopped commenting a bit before the LCK gauntlet started He must have sensed something wrong What the heck is going on this off season Also what s going to happen to Najin s spot I heard they are disbanding
So it begins
Chaser dade on new mvp team the dream
As a Cpt Jack fan i hope he goes on a team that value his skill and he gets play time Idc if its the worst team i just want to watch him play
He retired to go to school

That Jin Air fan on Inven must be deleting his account right about now lol
Goddamn where is chaser going
I m not really surprised about Chaser if he has found a home yet he will after this I wonder how Jin air will fair next season
What is happening omg
Before you guys say Chinese money it could be entirely possible that they re going to IM or CJ
IM is funded by Chinese money
or the new mvp team or one of the new challenger teams
chaser is a monster hope he gets a on a strong team or gets paid
CJ Chaser plz
Afaik Cpt Jack was going to retire and Chaser leaving had been rumoured for a while But Trace is news to me Between these three leaving and GBM going to NRG it has not been a good off season for the Jin Air veterans I hope they can shape the rookie roster into a competitive team maybe add some new talent I still believe in Pilot
No GBM Chaser or Trace R I P Jin air So sad to see The captain leaving as well
RIP Cpt Jack
So many free Koreans right now
CJ CHASER PLEASE
Fnatic Chaser confirmed s
Losing Trace chaser and GBM basically killed Jin Air Those three were what made them a good team
Don t blame Chaser for leaving if they planed to keep him on the bench for whatever reason huge loss for JAG Feels Sadplane jpg
FNC Chaser the dream
This offseason sucks
Cpt Jack to SKT as sub adc D Faker will be happy lol PS Yeah I am aware that it has been announced that he will be attending university
Finally Chaser will have a decent team I hope so What a bad move from Jin Air
Captain Pilot RIP Jin Air
Jin Air without Chaser is pretty much nothing
Cpt Jack is gone guess I ll need a new flair next season
FNC Chaser FNC Trace
Don t like Trace but fnc chaser gets me hard
i meant as a package yeah for me D
looks like its time to change my flair boys
jin air with GBM Chaser Trace Top Tier LCK jin air with Kuzan Winged SoHwan Bottom Tier LCK
Was IEM San Jose impact that huge or they was going to remake the tean anyway
sadplane jpg
This should be the first news of many Korean roster changes tonight It was pretty obvious Chaser would leave he followed the same pattern GBM did I assume he will cash out in China or go to LZ IM
It s started announce spirit now
Spirit left WE because he wanted a chance of winning worlds though
What has that got to do with anything I never said which team to announce him lmao I literally mean any team announce Spirit
Rofl well when you write a comment like that on a thread where Jin Air released their members you sort of have to assume that s what you meant I mean why would you say any team announce Spirit now on a thread where a team is RELEASING their members rather than welcoming
Hope Cpt Jack actually gets some playtime
He s retiring and going to university
Yeah saw that a little while ago Sad boiz
Chaser is one of the best junglers in the world right now So many teams will be going after him
I guess you could say they would be CHASING after him
deleted
I got a tumor In my head from reading that translation
its amazing how Winged was playing in brazil one year ago and now hes the main jungler for one of the best teams in korea
Jin Air s not even close to being one of the best teams in Korea
Well technically they are it just depends on how narrow your definition of best is
Jin Air is at best a playoff team
Jin Air has been a consistently 4th place team in Korea I think the 4th strongest team can definetly be considered one of the best in the region
Jin Air finished 6th last split and have only lost their best players since then They re pretty much the Dignitas of Korea Not sure where you re getting consistently 4th best from
jin air without chaser isn t good team anymore They even lost to CLG at IEM
FNC Chaser inc
no
IEM fallout
None of those three played at IEM though
thats why they left
No they didn t play them because 1 TrAce has fallen off and they wanted to have a carry top laner SoHwan 2 Chaser had already told them he was going to leave when his contract expired so they were getting Winged playtime 3 Cpt Jack is retiring
Well Jin Air successfully destroyed one of the most talented lineups in Korea terribly mismanaged team in 2015
chaser is so fuckin good why jin air why IM must be constructing one hell of a rosterDo you think the breasts are big enough yet
They re making up for the lack of Riot doing it lately
Even women like girls with tig ol bitties https youtu be 6YJ91FKZHI0 t 3m4s Usually people who are upset by large breasts are just jealous
i can jump on the ol tig bitties train with no problem
TIL if you type bit titty train in google images you get scenes of porn happening on the train sad Hoping for a train made out of boobs
The obvious evolution of the human centipede The boob train
maybe we have to try it with tig bitty train D
I don t hate nor like them I can only see negatives for the lady carrying them tho unnecessary weight get in the way etc but I am jealous of all the attention and benefits they gain from simply getting lucky with their genes But I guess that s normal Everyone would like to get free stuff and advantage without having to do anything P
Not yet We need to go bigger
Getting close
then she should have 8 breasts to make up for Jinx Kalista and Kindred maybe 10 coz Illaoi
Introduce Alistar s wife
Can t milk those
just no
No
Nope more is more which in turn is better
Clicked it saw obligatory overtly sexual pose Seems legit to me If you ever try to look up art for your favorite champion the very very best art is always borderline or full on R34 Apparently motivation makes the art
Maybe it s just perspective but those legs are meaty as fuck
Kinda reminds me of crossdressing Cloud
Wonder how they ll execute that part in the remake or if they re going to dump it altogether
Oh it s happening
Cloud was the best girl all along
delicious trap Cloud incoming
That was such a strange but hilarious part I ll be really sad if they cut it
It d be really sad if they cut it It s rather famous so I doubt they will
she looks pretty hot tho her face looks a bit ugly or just strange but still ok
I changed the face abit Her left eye is too far in the original image head neck area skin color does not match her arm Not against this guy or anything but there are many things that can still be brushed up Most of the mistakes here i see are common anatomical mistakes that arises sometimes because the artist has work on the piece for too long Then again with that difficult of the pose and foreshortening effect requires constant breaks and checking to be able to spot on your own loved the dynamics and concept happening in this fan splash
No offense but this change is for the worse
i think the old one looks better after watching her more i can say she is not ugly she is fine and i can not do it again did it before 4hours
Honestly I think the main problem of what makes Riven look weird is the color of her eyebrows it looks like she doesn t have any If you could give her brown eyebrows I think she d look a lot better

Overly sexualized and her body and face look so fucked up how can people like this It looks like it s drawn by an amateur who just likes big tits without actually knowing how to draw a female body
i think we saw 2 different pictures she isn t over sexualized and if that to you is an amateur drawn then idk man but you clearly lack an understanding for art
Maybe you should go outside and be socialize with people more It s not over sexualized or something like that Besides female bodies don t have to be realistic in game Especially when it comes to Korean artwork
It s called concept art The point is the idea behind the skin not the artist rendition Riot obviously could formulate a better finalized model
Show us your best work
Like you could do better lmao
Because to critizize somebody you have to able to do the same Professional Athletes dont tell the analysts to do it better after a fuck up too And tbh even tho he worded it poorly that face is bad no excuses You dont have to be an artist to see that It could have been done better
There s a difference between criticizing someone s work and calling them an amateur Analysts can tell when pros fuck up but they don t say this guy is clearly gold elo If you re gonna act like the drawing is bad and drawn by an amateur you d better be able to explain why instead of saying oh I just don t like it
Thats why I said he worded it poorly Im not a fan of People just calling someone out for doing something bad but Im also not a Fan of people excusing bad things because others cant do it Imo its ok done but id say Amateur as well The Face is weird and the Proportions are totally off The Hair line is also very weird placed Im not going to not call him an amateur just because he can color nicely
man even with skin concepts the Koreans beat the West
I like it but those breasts tho
I would be so happy if all fanart was new concepts rather than some sketch any artist could do Art creativity should be what gets to the front page
AKA Chun li
Please let this awesome skin come with the Zed Hatter

I M SO FUCKING HAPPY RIGHT NOW
FROGGEN VS FAKER AT LAST
lets just proof that karthus wins lane vs leblanc
Unfortunatly both of those say that karthus counters lb No way winning lane btw
Really I ve only played that matchup as LB and it seems to be easy lane wise But if Froggen says so
And Faker himself approves nothing can be agrued here
I would concede in both cases
99 9 of the reasonable players worldwide would probably concede to any of those 2 chaps
It s different at different level of play Below diamond lb pretty much wins any lane in my experience lol
LeBlenk
We will see some topnotch Xerath plays instead of this
What do you mean Those were some amazing plays but Nidalee was in fact just too tanky
Bitch was dead without those merc treads tbh
IT S FUCKING HAPPENING

Top Huni Jungle Amazing Mid xPeke ADC Rekkles Support KaSing Replaces Yellowstar due to the rule of a maximum of two players from each team attending There are no more 2 members from OG so it means that Mithy could be the one replacing Yellowstar Does anyone know who got more votes Mithy or Kasing I don t know how to check it
Haven t checked but iirc Kasing was a good 5 or something above Mithy it s a shame
That 5 is TSM fans who said I don t watch EU but this guy played for TSM In all seriousness though it sucks that Mithy doesn t get to go If Yellowstar wasn t a monster Mithy would be the best support in Europe
Mechanically I think Mithy is a better support but Yellowstar being team captain shot caller and all the other shit he does is probably why he s the best in europe
Yeah same reason why Marin is the best top laner in the world despite some players Smeb being better in lane He s a better team fighter a shot caller and a team captain
KOO were known for their shot calling and it s the primary reason they did so well and Smeb was their shot caller and he didn t have Faker on his team with the only other position they had a better player in being Support
Same reason why xPeke is still a legend in the scene too He may not be Faker but he is the captain and the face of the team I m curious to see how Origen does without him
Absolutely this I don t think people realize how much YS makes the rest of the team perform at a world class level
I love how upset people are getting over a system based on votes I can use my vote how I want I can vote for someone if I think they have a stupid name I can vote for someone because I think they will do badly It s a voting system it s not meant to be taken seriously
mithy s better than yellow mechanically but yellow s obviously a better team captain
Kasing
THE CHINESE FANS THO Cant remember the exact number bot lots and lots and lots voted for him
56
IS that confirmed I don t want to change my pants unless it s forsure
Is this confirmed Thought Febiven was goin If Froggen is coming to All Stars I sure as hell am goin to watch every match he plays As a Froggen fan this makes me hyped
no febiven won t because they already have 2 fnatic players huni and rekkles and both have more votes than febiven so these 2 will go to all star which means the 3 froggen will go
It just baffles me that Froggen placed third to being with Life of a fanboy is hard
I ve been praying so hard for this TT TT FROGGEEEEN 3
Now if only Niels went instead of Rekkles
Then it would be Febiven instead of Froggen
no yellow would go instead of kasing as yellow was 1st and febi was 2nd
you don t like Rekkles Why
I like him but judging from Worlds his performance was not as good as it used to be while Niels was a fucking monster And just imagine a solo Q challenger player to all stars in one season would be really good to him and I think he deserves it more
WE DID IT REDDIT
thank god D

HOLY FUCK YES
Froggen is also nice but Xpeke is something special Ive been following the League scene since season 1 There is no player that I like more than Xpeke SO sad that he won t attending but at same time I understand that Peke is busy
While sexpeke is still fantastic and everyone still has much love for him Froggen is less favoured to have fortunate things happen to him in comparison He is easily an equal to peke in skill but hasn t had the fortune to be on world class teams RIP ALL
Froggen was on one of the best teams of S2
where he was the best player on by far wickd and krepo were also good but he was the standout player
I m guessing CLG EU doesn t count as one Season 2 happened and in that case xPeke didn t get to worlds but yea i gotta agree he had some misfortunes in his career
clg eu got hardcarried by froggen even back in the days not saying the team was shit but froggen was just god
Eh back during Season 2 Wickd had his moments too Froggen was a standout for sure but Wickd was very good too
HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPE
My predictions are coming together
YES
Guess China wins cause they voted Froggen
first china victory in last few months
http zippy gfycat com HardPlainAphid mp4
nicememe
They have children
Child One Child policy has only been gone for a month
yes when we talk about china we are referring to a single family in china
You forgot the twins
Good guy Xpeke letting Froggen play D
Who s going now Febiven or Froggen
Froggen because FNC already has 2 players
Sigh all those people wasted their votes on xPeke
If most of those votes went to Febi we would have gotten Niels as well
Froggen all fnatic orgien COME AT ME
O oow I did this the other day and it doesn t end well buddy
I support this
And Huni
rekkles and YS or is huni still a fnc member for the all stars stuff
Yes he is DL still counts as CLG too
Yes this is based off of rosters from S5 Summer split so Huni is still a Fnatic player for this event
So will he be wearing the jersey or are they getting a special one for allstars
They will get one for Team Fire and Team Ice most likely
lol good thing because Doublelift would have had to go get his from the dump
I thought they used to wear the team shirt and an All stars jacket
The 2 from FNC with moste Votes Im not sure if Rekkles or Febiven have more Votes We see Froggen or Niels
Xpekt to see Froggen
Time to shine
I m so hyped that Anivia is actually viable now It s been so long since Froggnivia has been feared that I had lost all hopes that she would come back one day Plz rito don t go on with the current PBE nerfs on the bird until All Star is over Q Q Actually I hope that Anivia nerfs are not going through at all I just want to see Froggen going full S2 and dominate with Anivia again Anivia is the first champion I bought Froggen is the one that hooked me into esport back in early season 2 I was like Wow his opponents were so afraid of his Anivia that they are permabanning it from him I instantly became a fan
What actually happend since Anivia is more viable now than before I mean wouldn t the faster games make her even more out of the meta since she needs time to scale with tear rod
http champion gg champion Anivia see win rate by game length on the right Anivia is an early game champion The way I explain that She has not only good ratios but very strong base damage and a very good laning phase because of her autoattack range 600 and her passive In the early game 4 seconds is often not enough to kill anivia egg in 1 on 1 Her insane waveclear after 6 also means that she has the control over the minion waves She can push you up to tower and there is little you can do to prevent that If you try to take her 1v1 she has the minion advantage if you try to farm it up by tanking the wave she can just burst the shit out of you She can also clear the crap out of jungle camps As the game goes on cooldowns of dash and damage output goes up which means that her wall is less and less relevant against champions with mobility and her passive is less and less relevant overall When the lategame comes close people start to reach a decent amount of movespeed and dodging Anivia slow and static spells become easier and easier Now personally I play strange high scaling style of Anivia but I m definitely an outlier With the way people usually play her what I ve written above checks in
I main Anivia and I agree that she has a very strong early game Even with Tear Catalyst the bird does meaningful damage with a few points in E and her passive makes it very difficult for the opposing laner to kill you pre 6 unless you re playing really far up Anivia also eats melee champions alive and with Fiora Riven Irelia and Jax very strong right now I think Anivia is a really safe pick for most team comps
xPeke being a bro and letting Froggen go
Im so hyped for Froggen to be playing versus international midlaners even though it is not a serious competition I am looking forward to the Froggen vs Faker match
It took only 2 years to see this matchup
3 years even
Karthus vs LeBlenk HYPE
Froggen mostly plays PvE it s irrelevant who his opponent is
Yep upvoted your comment People think they are going to see intense 1v1s Froggen afk farms vs agressive mids he always did and always does
I will only say this Anivia vs Bjergsen s Zed
FROGGEN FAKER HYPEE
Is froggen next Please say yes
Well technically he is not but Febiven can t go FNC has 2 players already so Froggen is going to play
inb4 rekkles or huni stepdown to fk froggen dreams ayy lmao
Well it would crash my and every Froggen fan dreams not his
F F Froggen
Froggen vs Faker at long last
Froggen is finally out of elo hell
carried by peke how ironic
FROGGEN BOYS FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS HYPE TRAIN CHOO CHOO
Froggen
FROOOOOOOOOOOGGEN FROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGEN
FROGGEN
Tbh froggen was great at all stars last season Mejais tanknivia never forget
FROGGEN YES
Nice to see Froggen still has a strong following in this thread Such a likeable and consistently top level player
Aivina Gnik to the rescue
FROGGEN HYPE MY BODY IS READY
CHU CHU ITS THE FROGGEN HYPETRAIN
I honestly bought a ticket with the chance of meeting him finally and I am actually pretty sad now
GO FROGGEN IT S YOUR CHANCE
FROGGEN HYPE
FROGGEN HYPE
FROGGEN YEEEEEEEES and keep working on what u love peke
Without a 2nd origen player does that mean we can get mithy over Kasing since he had a higher vote
yes it should be i guess riot will announce the EU allstar roster 1 houtr before the tournament starts and then disqualifying EU for not having the players there
Sounds about right
YES Froggen should ve been 1 vote anyway Hopefully he wants to go
PLEASE FROGGEN
FROGGEN I M SO HAPPY
Ehrmageeehrd Fr ggen
A bit sad I voted for Peke because I thought that it would be the last time that we see him play on stage still happy for Froggen
Welcome to Whose All Stars is it anyway where the people you want don t go and the votes don t matter
FROGGEN FROGGEN
FROGGEN BBY
Not only Froggen vs Faker hype but also Froggen vs Bjergsen again EU Danish MIDS battle and Froggen vs Toyz legacy battle season 2 beast midlaners
HYPE
Just confirmed on Froggen s stream I ll fucking rekt that kid on playing Faker 1v1 Karthus vs Leblanc and Leblanc vs Karthus ALL STARS match
Glad i voted for froggen
China saw it coming Crumbz prophet teached them well
WOOO FROGGEN BOYZ
Xpeke made the correct choice business wise BUT THE HYPE FOR FROGGEN IS REAL
OMFG I M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW THANK YOU PEKE
Unfortunate but atleast we get to see Froggen vs Faker
God bless Wouldn t be allstars without Froggen
LOL the only people i see saying that huni should step down are people with fnatic flairs
even if huni steps down i think yellowstar has more votes than febiven xpeke landslide vote that yellowstar would just end up replacing KaSing and froggen will still get the midlane
froggen xpeke
FROGGEEEEEEN FINALLY MY FLAIR IS RELEVANT INTERNATIONALLY
inb4 Froggen pulls out
nukeduck at allstars would be hilarious
super sad about this don t know if there will be another chance to see him in All Stars in the future But I hope working on Origen is working out well for him and the team Better not to take on too many endeavors at once and burn out
Froggen and rekkles together rip eu
what do you mean yb that
Rekkles was shit when he was in elements
All stars turning into the Pro Bowl
Why is his facebook still FnaticXpeke
Does this mean no AMA still
is this all star like 2013 or 2014 one
Starting to look like the NFL now since everyone skips the pro bowl
Soooo why is riot not checking stuff like this up before hand
Has anyone received confirmation if Dyrus is attending or not Or any other questionable picks for All Stars
this entire tournament is really starting to become a massive joke pretty sure 25 of the guys voted on has been replaced aldready
Why do we still vote I understand the players but
So similarly to IEM I feel that this would be the one replacing Yellowstar
Then it would be the one replacing Yellowstar
Froggen will play without worries because he won t have a chance to get kabum d
Froggen bjergsen faker toyz and i think its rookie idk But im fucking hyped for mid
can we not have soaz instead of huni in the top now
OH MY GOD MY DREAM IS COMING TRUE
Nice Froggen 1 Would be perfect if it was Niels instead of Rekkles and Yellow instead of Kasing
He may not be Faker but he is the first champion I bought
Who will backdoor at All Stars then
he is busy getting rich P
Does that mean we get Froggen Praise jeebuz
Honestly I m kinda disappointed I think they should make it a 3 players per team rule cause now we have one second choice kaSing and one third choice Froggen Not what people voted at all It sucks that they simply get to go by default
If Yellowstar wasn t a monster Mithy would be really good to him in comparison
Suppose we have to accept Froggen If we didn t drop hacks would probably occurChauster the accountant hope he is showing those numbers how he is top fucking percentage
THE TOP FUCKING PERCEN TAGE
I keep reading this Where is this from
IT S FROM CHAUSTER TOP FUCKING PER CENT AGE
he actually never said it himself
The original meme was from pokemon google Joey s Ratata and someone applied it to Chauster because Chau basically thinks he is top fucking percentage
https www linkedin com in steve chau 08419250
Well this is IEM San Jose and once more I am interviewing Chauster he has emerged for San Jose and have once more played in a celebrity showmatch Is it fun for you to come back and see all this stuff C Uh yeah it s really fun basically the last time I went to an event was last year last year s IEM San Jose but I really just want to come out and just meet all the old faces old friends see them again cuz I don t really see them throughout the year Who are you going to see or hang out with here C Link and Benny are coming I should be hanging out with them later I ve been walking around with Hotshot the entire day and pretty much anyone actually You get a chance you were playing against Double right is that how it worked C Yeah I was playing against Doublelift but it s kind of like when you come to these events you can t really hang out with the players as much cuz they gotta be super serious now practice every day so unless they lose Unless they lose and they re just salty C And you don t want to hang out with them Then it s just rough Now what have you thought cuz it s kind of funny because there s been so much talk about CLG lately dunno if you ve seen any of this obviously you came out and did a had some statements around the time when Link released the Donezo Manifesto as it s been called C Donezo Manifesto yes Yeah the Donezo Manifesto Now obviously even more drama with Doublelift getting kicked from the team joining TSM all the stuff that happened afterwards Do you have any thoughts on any of that stuff or what is it like for you at least seeing the stuff happen C It s kind of weird actually I was like outside downtown and then I read the news randomly and I was like what the hell is this real TSM Doublelift And then kind of part of me was like I don t really know how to feel cuz I guess once you re on CLG you kind of feel like you live or die with it then I saw him on TSM I was like man like what happened But you know being in the inside I kind of know right so it s like it wasn t a big mystery to me but it just feels wrong I guess a lot of fans feel the same way Have you gotten used to it yet It took me a little bit to get used to but I eventually I did Have you gotten used to it C Yeah I mean after witnessing all those is this real or fake like is this TSM Doublelift and like CLG Wildturtle and I was like oh this is pretty funny But yeah you get used to it What did you think of all the stuff that came out afterwards we had Doublelift making statements on stream and then we had Aphromoo saying his own thing and then we had Hotshot do the big interview Did you see any of that stuff did you have any thoughts on it C I was I pretty much looked at all of it just watching from an outside perspective I mean I m definitely not the right person to talk about PR but can t really say much I mean obviously the story s not out there and you know just decisions are made what s done is done So we ve seen so much change in the LCS I think we actually have 5 of the 10 teams changing in NA LCS right now So many of the people you played with are now gone there s only like Doublelift is an example one Xpecial said he might be on an LCS team but so many people leaving it s almost like a completely new scene As someone who was there from the start you know what is it like now seeing the stuff or do you still watch it what are your thoughts on the new LCS I guess C Well I still keep up with like the current news sort of cuz I read Reddit frequently but I mean seeing all these old players come and go I mean when I was playing they were kind of like kids to me since I m like one of the only guys that kind of I m just old for a gamer I m really old and Xpecial to me is young and now he s he s considered old But seeing these guys retire I think it s just normal it just shows you the state of what esports actually is I know people are crazy about like esports is growing but really that s what it is it may be growing but a lot of players that played their time is done and they have to move on What about you is there any chance we ll ever see you return to esports besides the IEM San Jose showmatches C Maybe if they invite me out to IEM San Jose next year but uh as for now I have no plans I m working already I m an accountant it s really boring for someone who used to be a professional gamer But unless I somehow find myself short of a job nope Do you ever sit there you know you re looking at the Excel spreadsheet in your cubicle and you just sort of alt tab over to a little scene of you winning a tournament or something like that and like you know you lose your vision and it just kind of goes into that moment and you re like what I was you know C Yeah for sure I mean I definitely have those moments cuz you just go to work you study or whatever I m trying to get my CPA and afterwards just kind of sit there and oh man I used to do so much I used to travel I used to play games But really I mean those days are kind of over I guess kind of like referring back to your earlier question about like esports and whatnot I think right now there s just less personality everywhere basically because esports is becoming more of a sport so who s like one person with personality out there Doublelift right but technically that s cuz he s a relic of the past now Whereas back in the day you had so much what a dumb team right you had Hotshot me jiji Saint and Doublelift on the same team like five personalities and now you can t have that you can t imagine having like jiji and PR it s like a disaster So Time s are a changing Is there anything that you want to say to any of the Chauster fans out there that are hoping that one day you ll swoop in to a world championship and you know coach or play support again and save the day for North America C Uh just basically thanks for all the support I mean it s nice to see I still frequent Reddit I see those everytime my name s mentioned it just do some chain where they like top percentage everything he says is right well I least have a meme legacy that s fun Yeah the meme legacy C Keep it up Well thank you so much for the interview really good to see you again we ll see you next year at IEM San Jose For everyone else you can check out the rest of our coverage of all things League of Legends at gamespot com lol If you re the content creator and would like me to take this down just let me know and I ll take it down If you re the content creator and would like to use this elsewhere just let me know and I ll clean it up for you If you re anyone else

creator or anyone else have a nice day D
Appreciate this mang
Am I the only one confused why a dude who went to Berkeley settled for being a CPA Talk about a waste of top tier school there is very little salary variation from low to top ranked schools
Actually a very interesting interview to provide insight on what happens when you retire as a professional gamer You get a job So all kids out there considering a career in pro gaming be prepared to continue your education one day Enjoy the memories you ll have for a lifetime and dive into your second career
Chauster somehow attended and graduated from UC Berkeley while being a world class pro
He graduated before even becoming a pro he s an old man
Chauster was 21 at the end of Season 1 and had already retired by that summer that s one of the reasons why he refers to xpecial as young because xpecial is 3 4 years younger than Chauster Chauster made the decision to drop grad school and play with CLG for some time at the end of Season 1 when he had graduated from college
or stream
You ain t gonna be relevant forever TRM for instance doesn t bring in the numbers he used to Voyboy still has a massive following but even he isn t hands down 1 streamer when he s on like he used to be Gotta have an exit strategy Most of the pro s make enough money to pay for college or whatever education they need to get started in whatever career they want Just gotta spend it wisely
You can t really use TRM He left before league really became popular
Not to mention a lot of pros in NA right now are imports so their future education is vastly different from NA fans also some pros have very unique situations so do keep that in mind Bjergsen or froggen have their exits prepared calitrolz took care of his way before playing the LCS The average aspiring high Diamond Master Challenger players do not so long as they re not officially on a pro roster
In what way are froggen and bjergsen prepared
Especially since Bjergsen left his school to play video games
i m pretty sure bjerg will have like a 1m in his account after he retires with that money he can just put up a business in his town
Did u mean Bjergerking
Retained records good resume fame fat stacks versus I almost went pro back in the days of season 6
If only Link could have seen this post a year ago
Depends largely on the person and what they want to do and what their skill set is If you re not good at relationships and connections then a job where those items are essential to succeed probably isn t for you On the same token esports can t absorb all of the retiring pro players once they burn out or want to move on Yes there are some positions available casting coaching analyzing management but not every player is good at it There were 100 players just between NA and EU LCS last summer There just isn t enough out there and what is out there outsiders are sometimes in a better position to get because they already have the skills that are needed and just need the scene filled in for them
There might be a variety of jobs but that still doesn t address the number of jobs available and competition for those jobs with outside sources
Uhh keep in mind that pro s weren t paid like they are now back when he was playing
I think the lack of a tournament circuit really hurts the personality aspect Season 2 had all this hype around gambit and all sorts of interesting stories I ve been starting to follow some CS GO and there is always a story about a certain player that makes each tournament super interesting
Yep Lcs is way boring People are waiting for an anti climatic wc for a year There should be a lot more international tourneys
I still remember couple years ago when they were moving from a tournament circuit season 2 to the LCS format People brought this problem up but Riot did the changes anyway I think LCS is fine now that every region has a bit of exodus but I think it would be awesome if Riot at least did something along these lines for Challenger teams Wildcard regions I was talking about this yesterday in some other thread and I was arguing that in Tennis you have those small tournaments where all the top players still play because they need points to qualify for one of the 4 majors Their format allows upcoming talent to compete with the top players and maybe get better exposure for sponsorships or even improving faster which is something we don t really have with neither challenger teams or wildcard regions because those teams play on a very homogeneous and locked up environment
Yeah I like this In Bass fishing you have Bass Master Elite Series Bass Master Classic The big bucks kinda like worlds FLW and I m sure I am forgetting some but it keeps it interesting because you have your huge names like Mike Iaconelli and Kevin Van Dam competing in different areas with all kinds of different opponents And they have to every year hope for top 10 finishes in multiple tournaments to even get to go to the Classics
Man I never knew the world of bass fishing was so interesting Can you watch these on TV I m guessing it would be on like a wildlife channel or like the ocho
Think more like the Ocho It is on ESPN but I watch it online on youtube mostly But professional bass fishing is a very big industry with fisherman mainly being from the US but Japan is also pretty big into it
This reminds me of Grander Musashi the good old days of anime powered bass fishing
I agree It s really hard to see new talent since it s hard to do mid season roster changes and most teams only want established talent Very few teams are willing to invest resources into growing talented players from solo queue so it can be really hard for new players to start playing professionally
It also doesn t help that NA non veteran talent seems to flop on the big stage i e Flaresz
It would help if they actually got practice with LAN environments before LCS though
Surprising because in Dota this is almost entirely the opposite with people like RTZ and sumail I m honestly not sure why
dota allows individual skill to play a larger role in the outcome of games than league league is far more about map movement and planning and coordination which leads to experience being the best indicator of success as solo queue is the only way to play competitively prior to a team and solo queue lacks much of the planning and map movement while both games have plenty of individual skill to practice against in solo play it s been since S3 that new talent has shined in LCS so dramatically and not coincidentally S3 was the last era of individual skill being paramount in league
At the same time solo queue ranking isn t viewed as nearly as valuable in DotA as it is in LoL You won t have dota teams running tryouts with any 7k players invited The only way you ll really get exposure is through inhouses or forming your own team and being noticed
or directly playing with players in queue but yeah arbitrary elo rank guidelines are meaningless compared to actual first hand viewing of someones play you could legitimately be a top player in terms of individual skill but not play enough league to grind to challenger because individual skill doesn t translate to wins nearly as much as just coordinating your team This results in top players often having personalities that don t mesh as well
So its cs format
I don t know how CS format works because I only recently started watching it They have a bunch of tournaments but I have no idea how they are organized or which ones are the most relevant
Majors are the most relevant tournament for CS GO They have 4 a year and each have a big payout Then there are a series of different leagues hosted online and then a lan to determine the champion of that league some examples of these leagues are ESL ESEA Star Ladder and CEVO These tournaments have high payouts but each one requires teams to play well and be say top 8 10 and after that they are invited to that leagues lan and compete for the payout
There s Majors which are valve sponsored events those are the most important they have a group of legends and then a group of challengers The legends are like VP Fnatic TSM Envy G2 Navi These teams are the best of the best Then the challengers are like CLG Liquid Titan LG C9 Mouz Dignitas The teams that are better than most but still aren t the best Then you have what I call mini majors which have all these big named teams with a nice prize pool but aren t valve sponsored so they aren t technically majors they mean a bit to win them but don t hold as much merit as winning a major think winning MSI IEM Then there s just a ton of random invite tournaments and leagues that not every team plays in and doesn t mean too much Edit You will know if it s a major or not by opening CS GO and seeing sticker capsules for sale and all kinds of ads for it on the homepage
Isn t the difference between Legends and challengers that if you placed in the last major you get Legend status and an auto invite to the next major while the challengers have to qualify through feeder tournaments
Errr Legends are Legends because they made it out of groups You make it out of groups you get autoinvited next major and don t need to qualify Challengers needed to qualify because they didn t get out of groups weren t in the last major
Yea but generally those teams are Legends aside from G2 Then the same group of challengers usually qualify
But it still doesn t mean what you wrote
how many though there s already about 4 decent sized ones a year 8 IEM sized tournaments a year and then Worlds would be cool but I d prefer Bo2 LCS with 4 international tournaments a year personally
Honestly if Riot didnt gut IEMs we would be just fine
The format for IEMs is so fucking awful that I don t even really care about those events And they re timed in such a manner that the rosters half the time aren t even real rosters that lowers the stakes since especially for top teams like Fnc or TSM because they don t care about the money that much
Thats my point The format is shit but because of Riot they cant change it the prize money is negligible and overall the tournament has no weight whatsoever Koreans chinese teams dont even care about it they fly there like a day before the event not even scrimming with the competition or giving time to get rid of the jetlag Not to mention that Riot doesnt allow more than 2 teams from LCS to compete LCS is getting boring honestly Riot really needs to stop being stubborn about their ways because eventually they themselves gonna kill their own scene
4 tourneys a year is a pathetically tiny amount
so how many do you want 10 it would lose the hype quickly also what would happen to the medium lower teams they just fall off the planet of the earth Too many international tournaments would cause them to mean less people use the CSGO excuse but CSGO is just far more entertaining to watch in general
Yep and only a handful of those DOTA2 tournaments a year have a decent amount of hype really The rest don t really do well viewer wise It just provides an unstable scene where the guys who aren t getting to the big tournaments every couple of weeks are going to get shafted
I play GE and watch a lot of CSGO and I think LoL is far more interesting to watch Maybe I m just to old for the seemingly endless stream of tournaments I massively prefer LoLs LCS format over 3 Majors 3ish big leagues and a crapton of medium to small tournaments
I think they should just scrap the spring split to be honest It wasn t even impactful for a long time and then they just added the points method of qualifying for Worlds to make it relevant recently And that meant H2K went as the number 2 seed from EU instead of Origen I think the teams that should play at Worlds should be the best teams from each region at that time I don t like rewarding teams even if it only impacted seeding and maybe not who actually went this year that is arguable though just because they played well 4 months ago With spring split gone they have time for more international tournaments It might also allow the additional benefit of more flexible transfer windows for players since they don t have to be locked in so soon and so permanently for start of spring split Riot should also really try to encourage more outside investment in their game for these additional tournaments so they can offer more sizable prize pools for these new tournaments I think it would create a healthier ecosystem in the long run
LCS is Sterile it lacks the drama and interest of a true league an the stories of circuit
And the international tourneys shouldn t be influenced by Riot as sadly it destroys their quality
Most of the problem s the format though The threat of relegations and Bo1 s make teams a lot more risk averse If you re not a top tier team you re basically going to play safe to avoid getting knocked back out of the LCS and into the amateur league With Bo1 s you only have 1 shot to try out strats so a team avoids anything interesting If Riot implemented a Bo3 for NA and rewards for winning games things would become more compelling Saying the LCS concept is bad I feel is wrong Baseball Football Basketball every major US team sport has a league based format I feel like the bigger problem stems from Riot s implementation of the format
I think Bo1 give too much power to drafts and don t promote strategy enough You get outdrafted once you re likely to lose Even more so with surprise picks Then you don t have enough possibility to learn how to win by pure teamplay and map play on even ground
See the difference between Baseball and Basketball and other conventional sports and League is that those sports leagues lead up to a championship tournament of sorts similar to worlds for LoL except the tournament only has teams from the league teams that have all played each other before There are no international events outside of maybe the Olympics If it was possible having one giant league with teams from all around the world would obviously be the best option for LoL but that s not plausible
personalities drain when you have weekly games instead of monthly lans
League is getting more and more boring at the LCS level because no one shines as a true carry any more from any role aside from mid bot imo There s very little carry potential for top or jungle mains any more And the meta has not had a major shift in a long ass time
I take it you didn t watch worlds where top laners ruled and basically hard carried their teams
Maybe he was only watching TSM Games this season and also skipped the game where Dyrus played Olaf against Gravity
I wonder why Broken patch in a broken Darius state
Totally ignoring the fact that Darius wasn t picked or banned at all in the final and people like Smeb and Ssumday were bodying hard before the worlds patch on picks like Riven
What about the rest of the matches The whole tournament he was either picked or banned Riven was always strong however the juggernaut patch was one of the wort things ever released by riot
I agree it was a terrible patch but it was because of the ridiculous GP Mord and Fiora Smeb played Fiora into Ssumday s Darius and wrecked him
It wasn t just Darius that could carry in that meta The majority of teams were top lane focused and the majority of popular top lane champs could carry

Hi i m Bigfatlp s mod alittleboba come join the stream jiji stil lalive and kicking sometimes Scarra lends his hand with some hosts twitch tv bigfatlp
Does he have an actual job I always wonder how he supports himself
Chausuo chaudog chowder chaubear gone but not forgotten the one true NA mastermind LoL will never be the same without you
Forgot Chester but only the jiji and old Doublelift fans know of that nick name
I remember in a BIG BANG interview once one of the members was stating how there s tonns of talent in the music industry that have better vocals than them but the main reason they don t go big is due to the lack of personality All members in that band especially GD have really unique personalities to top it off
Yeah someone in r kpop posted how many groups debuted in 2014 I think it was something like 55 girl group and 53 guy groups The number was insane A very small number of those groups will succeed and that s already a handful of the trainees who didn t ready drop out or get cut for various reasons
Since League has become more popular and mainstream players can t be carefree and say whatever they want anymore More restrictions by Riot and if someone with a big personality spoke out he d probably get fined opposed to in season 2 when everyone partied and baylifed
And also there wouldn t be much time to party because that would just make teams fall further behind to the Korean teams And sure some teams can choose not to be as serious but that risks you getting relegated or auto relegated
It certainly was more interesting back then however A lot more random fun things happened too like Dyrus s pillow And random trash talk between teams that really helped build up rivalries and make things more interesting I still think the season 3 analyst desk was one of the most entertaining too things were a lot more relaxed and people threw around more random jokes to break up the usual talking
For those interested his Linkedin profile https www linkedin com in steve chau 08419250

He came up as a recommended connection for me I told him on Twitter and he emphatically told me not to add him LOL
Travis question when he asked about the moment killed me Well played u Tnomad well played
I think the scene lacks old personality because it s becoming much more professionalized and the fact that players get traded left and right sold bought transferred across regions so systematically and frequently There s not much time to build a story or create personalities when we don t even know how long the pro player will stay
There also is a much stricter rules regarding how riot wants their players to behave People the fans also take trash talking much more seriously nowadays
Fans also don t take bottom tier teams that well either The complaints about teams like Coast and NME were numerous
People generally love fun trash talking though it is common in other sports and helps to build up the rivalries between teams and make matches more interesting There was also a lot of other silly things that happened like Dyrus having a pillow on stage and so on Riot being so strict on so many different things actually hurt a lot of the personality the game had in the past so on a general level I basically agree with Chauster it seems
Serious case of rose tinted glasses by the community when it comes to reflecting on the old circuit scene
That seems like a pretty large assumption Why does it always seem like anytime someone talks about something being better in the past now on reddit the thread gets filled with people that disagree stating that everyone just has rose tinted glasses No way people could actually prefer the old system clearly
Because reflections always seem to completely ignore everything that was wrong with the old circuit system Patchy production values huge delays inconsistent meta that ranged from great to horrible significantly bigger gap between good and bad teams meaning a lot more lopsided match ups far less actual games and thats just a handful off the top of my head It s human nature to focus on the positives when we have fond memories of a time or era but i m 100 sure if we suddenly reverted back to the old circuit system people would remember why we were happy about the switch to the LCS format in the first place
100 the new system has positives the better production value being a huge one but the the old system had good things also The biggest two being that each event was majorly hyped and you got to see international play every 2 months or so I think everyone would be sad to see the weekly games leave but I do think it would be really exciting if they could add one or two more relevant international tournaments or if riot was willing to work with other events so they could break and allow teams to attend other things it would be amazing
For sure every format has its advantages and disadvantages I think LCS actually helped esports as whole a lot Its great for players because they get stability in their contracts Its a push for longetivity because you get more profesional teams and you are getting new talent with more professional teams and challenger scene For other sports when you see that there is professional league with player getting contracts for decent money more people see is viable career If you tried going pro and wanted to show your parents its viable the best thing is showing them weekly league I imagine LCS might cleared some space for other games on IEMs and it might get people who watch LCS to watch more IEM games and so on
I think it helped the scene more also and I think the stability for players and visibility of it as a sport is great but it could use some lets call it pizzazz now It is getting a big stale and I think it needs to go a bit backwords and create more large events Football has a ton of bowl games for instance more matches and game that really matter to people rather then just another weeks lcs which even the pro s have stated don t matter fucking at all all that matters is playoffs Even knowing the current system is better though I do miss still miss the unorganized old days though of season 1 and 2 Huge breaks in events meant that everyone streamed far more and we got to watch scrims which was a blast To bad everyone doesn t suck now though and teams have to practice 24 7
I stopped reading when you tried to blame inconsistent metas on a circuit format in fucking League of Legends a game that has patched every 2 weeks this year Let me guess you also think World s gameplay was representative of the meta over the whole year too
Im still recovering from the god awful stall meta but your right that has nothing to do with the old circuit system The current LCS system has issues but to say using the old system in todays climate would be an improvement is just flat out wrong Korea would sweep 95 of tournaments people would only see a handful of N A and E U games Salaries consistent competition stability and proper production values have evolved the scene in a way that we could only dream about back than Like everyone else I have fond memories of the early seasons but most of that stems from the iconic teams we had doing the rounds at the time
Everything in your second paragraph can be said about games that have third party events and actually have international competition And you have no basis for the handful of NA and EU games when people could hold region exclusive tournaments and smaller leagues just fine which is what s done in other games right now
production value and delay have nothing to do with the quality of the gameplay and inconsistent metas are always a thing in league look at worlds on juggernaut patch compared to he playoff patches and further back to the actual season patches we have the same large gaps between the best and the others as we did then as well see SKT i agree that if we suddenly reverted we d have issues but thats because of the dependence we have nowadays on riot and LCS i know for a fact i d be happier with OGN champions than LCK though
Because you are objectively wrong
Ha The old other people are wrong for having opinions different then your own Good argument
You don t need to look to the past to see how much better a tournament circuit is there are examples in other scenes
hello beaver teeth glad to see you interviewing another person
What he says is kinda true I mean the new players are good and all but they just lack that personality the older guys had I mean S1 S2 and even a bit of S3 was just a bunch of guys that were good at the game fucking around having all these funny stories and Yolo attitudes now you can t really have that anymore
Working in financial services sucks If I was Chauster and had a potential in into the esports scene I would absolutely jump on it There are analysts and coaches now I don t know that he d make a great head coach but if he caught up with the meta he s probably make a good strategic coach
does anyone have a youtube link to it for some reason i cant watch it on gamespot
Damn for a moment i thought that it is u Thooorin 2 Reflections episode and i would fulfill my urge for today s doublelift drama
https www youtube com watch v zV3MeYM 7Yc Youtube Mirror
top fucking percentage interview
holy shit the gamespot player is actually working for me
I disagree with what he s saying it wouldn t be a disaster to have big personalities
He means in the same team like CLG had Saint HSGG DL jiji Chauster that s 5 Doublelifts in one team I guess except jiji but still
Saint Chau and Hotshot are what created bad teammate version of liftlift
More like 5 Chausters Saint Doublelift inherited all of their bad traits and kept them for the better part of 3 years before trying to change anything
Yeah I m disagreeing with that statement
It s pretty damn hard Big personalities will usually have conflicts with each other soon or later and if you re talking about like 3 big personalities your team is going to have a lot of trouble functioning
Dude stop He already disagreed without providing any reasons or proof He s clearly thought this out better then you
He s kind of right about strong personalities The only Newer player that ive seen have a really strong personality is huhi But he s a waste because he doesn t Market himself very well
Do you mean Huni Not quite sure if Huhi from CLG has much of a personality yet
Nope Huhi he is the most genuinely animated person ive seen Aphromoo telling Huhi that he s going to give him the D and huhi didn t know what that meant It was pretty hilarious
so aphroo made a joke and that gives huhi a strong personality cuz he didnt know waht to day hmm ok no u should have taken the easy way out and said yes to huni
wat He s streaming right now see for yourself He s currently getting rekt by CPU lag
Can t tell if salty FNC fan or just plain dumb
rush has a good one
What does he mean by old personality Like the fact that league is becoming more professional is a good thing for esports Sure it might not be as entertaining as it used to be but its going to make money
This is money that other people earn Entertainment value is the value YOU get I don t understand you
It s not that hard to understand why some people prefer watching good better players play the game rather than big personalities or old school ones like Scarra Oddone or Shushei even though that s not really how the question was asked and answered in the interview
it s more like the good better players are not really entertaining outside of being good better at the game good players are and should be a dime a dozen that s what makes competition great that said if i wanted to be truly entertained that s not all i would desire from players it isn t a bad thing to want more personality from league s star players
He explains it more in the interview I believe
not really sure why so many fans are taking this outlook on esports who gives a shit if esports is more profitable more professional Esports is a form of entertainment I d take a less popular less profitable more entertaining esports scene over a more popular less entertaining esports scene any day of the week Honestly this sentiment just baffles me Why on earth did redditors become more concerned with how profitable esports is over how entertaining it is Whats the point of wanting esports to grow if it loses the flair that makes it appealing I can understand journalists analysts casters players etc wanting the scene to grow and become more professional they want a payout they want to make as much money as they can doing what they love but fans people who don t benefit from esports becoming more professional or more profitable in any way i can t understand that at all
But it s not necessary at all to have strong personalities and things like that for the scene to be entertaining just look at Faker when it comes to the public the guy has absolutely no personality whatsoever he does interviews and the sort but you can tell that it isn t something like a persona or that it was obviously something practically read from a script what he said yet people are still very entertained by watching his games him playing or wanting to interact with him and it entertains those people greatly you don t really need personalities for a scene to be succesful although it doesn t mean that i cannot have some it absolutely can but all you need to have a healthy and entertaining scene is things that people can relate to teams iconic players etc Another example look at UoL in the past year none of those players were particularly popular before nor did they ever have something like a well known stream or anything that could remain you of them as personalities nothing at all yet a ton of people were entertained by them because of their cheesy p cks and unusual name basically a unique brand but not a single one of those fans was attracted to any of those players personalities
I think that s the problem with anything that becomes main stream because it becomes a watered down version of what made it popular in the first instance It s kind of why I m trying to get into CS GO more It feels a lot like the older League scene to me
Every sport has people who watch for entertainment and people who watch for analytical value Like is like any other sport in that regard I want league and esports to grow and make more money I like watching the games for analysis and improving my own gameplay and of course entertainment just like any other fan
I watch the games for analytical value and for entertainment As a fan if the players want to shit talk and have personality go ahead The issue with that is league and esports teams are professionally owned they need to make money out of their team otherwise they wont have one You wanna be professional act like one I guarantee you management from all the team owners and staff have told them to not fk around and stay professional on all sorts of media because how the players act reflects on the team Also no other esport in the industry as far as i know charges players money and fines them if they dont follow the rules This professionalism from riot will ensure that their brand is taken seriously as an esport which wants to be seen as an actual sport So as a fan I love players that have personality but that gets restricted by the teams and owners for their own sake Not to mention some players have no personality and just play the game because theyre good at it lol
How does player skill have to do with their personality
Most of the Korean players did not interact much with the community part of the reason being because most of them don t speak English Imagine a few years down the line the entire NA LCS is only Korean players and in the interviews they almost always have to have a translator on hand That s the situation that I m talking about
That wont happen riot will not let it happen
I m in the minority here but god damn does chauster annoy me Acts like he was gods gift to league of legends we all know it was faker
I mean relatively speaking he kind of was But it speaks more about how much weaker the competition was at the time Bearing in mind this was near the beginning of the game pretty much You have to give credit where it s due There s a reason why there are so many CLG fans because they were the best team at the beginning A lot of their members inspired many players to go pro in the first place
he was god at that time no lie
Nah dude Faker is god
Who actually gives a fuck about Chauster anymore
all this jackass does is play Path of the Exile
Does he still do that That was so long ago
he was duoing with doubelift on stream a few weeks ago and Chauster said i m done gonna go play POE
Uh we have a shit ton of personality in League that is better then the old guard who just bitched at each other We have C9 s trio of memers TSM always has new and popular personalities CLG has their lovable clowns and EU has some interesting people that stream very little That is not even considering all the other regions that we do not even see on Reddit daily The old scene was cool and all but I will take these new memers over a bunch of bitchy old guys who fell off and miss the popularity
one of the worst pro players to ever play the game next to hotshotgg of course
Stay new friend
A fnatic bandwagoner Seems about right
Back in the day he was a monster AD carry The skills wouldn t hold up now but you d get the same thing if you took an NFL player from fourty years ago and made them play today
He was also a godlike support in season 2 IMO he was the best in NA at that point and one of the best in the world
deleted
If this is a serious question he played on CLG for ages He played every single role competitively he was at one point season 2ish one of the best supports in the world and was together with DL probably a top 2 bot lane in the world He was known for having good game knowledge eventually retired after S3
A old player who used to be on CLGman quas is a beast and one of the nicest guys i have met wish him the best
He s a strong NA Top Laner who qualifies as an NA resident He s worth a lot and probably knows that now Shame this incident happened after the off season moves Interesting
Immortals ex tip and ex gravity all need rosters I think that quas can find a home on one of them
If the Immortal line up rumors are true it would be either ex TiP or ex Gravity Still it doesn t sound like Quas is going to be let go just not playing for the team
I m not even sure Team Liquid knows the status of Quas on the team The title of the post mentioning Quas being suspended is pretty vague Update for the LCS 2016 Season Diego Ruiz Team Liquid s statement makes it almost sound like it s a temporary suspension until they figure things out Quas on the other hand makes it sound like he is leaving the scene for good A lot of things must be influx at the moment Liquid probably rushed out a statement because they didn t want any leaks trickling out bit by bit
I m actually really sad about this Edit I can t say anything more but trust me when I say as a friend of Quas that this is one of the saddest moments in my life
I just hope he didn t try to commit suicide because this xpecial post combined with his facebook post makes it seem like something bad happened to him and Quass was in a bad place Just hope the guy is gonna be alright
I don t think suspension would be the word they use in that case I think they d go with leave of absence or something less punitive sounding
Suspension is definitely a punishment and they say an incident occurred which is PR speak for Quas doing something pretty bad Quas statement confuses me though he seems to think he is definitely off the team which a suspension does not imply
That s kind of what makes it feel like a poaching incident to me He feels like he s out the door They want to punish him publicly but they are unsure the best way for their brand to proceed Though the many references to drugs in this thread could also make sense EDIT Oh yeah xPecial s comment also makes it feel like a substance abuse issue
Just looking at the Facebook post from last week the thread allegedly by him from months ago and the way things are being treated at the moment I wouldn t be surprised by a substance abuse issue I m not sure how TL handles stuff like that but the way they say that Steve is working with Quas and his family I m guessing this isn t a minor incident and they are looking into options between sending Quas home to his family and or rehab
Its something about his family back home in Venezuela
Me too Quas is a great NA top laner and he did wonders for TL I really hope his suspension is lifted or he finds a contending team in NA
Is this possibly related to that post
i think this is pretty important i know spanish and the post is some intense shit he s talking about venezuela and that he is now able to sympathize with other humans feelings and in the comments he say that he was focussed on league because he was surrended on himself i can t translate that very well i m not from venezuela i can t say enought that the post is really strange EDIT i want to say also that the most strange things are in the comment section i don t want to translate it because it makes me very unconfortable just see it
Sound like the kind of shit you say before doing something fucked up
This is what the last lines say i can t translate everything because my english suck and i m not from venezuela I will spend the rest of my life trying to connect with the others and feel this emotions with them and i hope to help cure their pain and help people from the pain that was very present in my life and depressed myself from these humans emotions since forever
Maybe they did acid together tripped balls and are opening a headshop
Vooby Quas Do Venezuela The movie
Jim is suspended too
Yeah No more Jim Was sorry to hear it
Or on something
That sounds like something written by someone strung out on drugs
Pretty much I used to abuse the shit out of adderall and a few other perscription drugs and this is the kinda shit that would come out of my mouth But its also possible that its from some kind of psychological issue like depression or bipolar disorder
It also would explain the suspension rather than being cut Say he did something like dropkick Piglet in the face in that case he would probably be cut immediately If it is a drug problem they are more likely to suspend him notify is family and help him work through his problems
I m sorry man I m just stuck on the image of Quas dropkicking Piglet in the face
When he becomes president I hope he legalizes paragraphs Holy wall of text batman
It s separated in paragraphs in the facebook post
Quas for president confirmed
It all makes sense now Quas is Hugo Chavez lost son hidden away out of fear of persecution
Hiding in the US sounds like a good idea
wtf did i just read
The ramblings of someone on shrooms
his chakra awakened
http i imgur com D3MaDMH png
What does this mean
Nothing even remotely related to league It talks about the Chavez era in Venezuela
Existential issue
kinda is more spiritual or emotional he realized we live in a fucked world
This is a process normal people go through when they go to college Or spend a few years working at taco bell
DONT listen to this ppl or the other ppl saying he is on drugs BASICALLY he is saying that Venezuela was so fucked up even when he was still there and that maked him a quiet serius and kinda negative man Therefore he didnt liked to talk or meet ppl or just express but lately he has been doing it and he says it feels good so that plus the hard time his country family and friends are living maked him realize some things I GUESS so he is trying to help to talk to ppl in those bad situations so from now to his death he is going to try hard to acomplish that He said that on November 23th so I guess thats why he got suspended even tho he was like retiring or just leaving league for a time Hope it helps you my englado is not at its finest
It s kind of sad that people automatically assume he s depressed or even suicidial when he talks about his life his emotions and his home country a bit more ex and intensively than what they deem as normal
TLDR Quas is quitting esports permanently to pursue a career in psychology
philosophy
weed
Darien studies
Edit Just discovered Facebook can translate haven t used Facebook in over a year Welp I roughly translated the post to the best of my abilities I m not a native Spanish speaker and learned how to speak at around 9 10 conversationally the grammar and sentence structure seemingly long run on sentences made it pretty confusing I could read everything but properly contextualizing it to English was once again very confusing But yeah Quas sounds like he s going through a hard time emotionally I really hope he s doing alright and didn t do something unforgivable and can find himself in a better spot mentally emotionally I would like to write to my Venezuelan fans my compatriots my comrades my brothers to the indescribable realization that I have had in my life in these final last recent days ultimos dias translates to English as final or last days I ve lived the majority of my life disconnected from the rest of society thinking there was something bad close to me depressed and with resentment The Venezuelan people are a beautiful people they are human beings that can feel so many sensations emotions I grew up when Hugo Chavez governed there was a separation in the country chavistas y oposicion this same system exists in Venezuela in whatever way possible and what I have noticed is this comes from feelings sentimientos translates to feelings completely distinct emotions And the hate between one person and another with your Venezuelan brothers to me was reminiscent of how the chavistas acted They were unreasonable controlling aggressive and full of anger In my opinion Hugo Chavez was an extremely intelligent human being and I m not referring to his education or learnings nor the things he knew wisdom he had He was a human being that could transmit feelings to the people that followed him he knew how to ignite the anger the people had inside them the majority of them poor Los Cuales not sure if this is a Venezuelan slang word or insult to refer to the poor are a people that are constantly judged and made to feel a certain way due to their economic situation In the end he learned how to control that quantity of people through this the facts didn t matter and the things he said didn t even need to be true The words he said were irrelevant it was the feelings emotions sensations the manner in which he expressed himself that formed his foundation of followers He controlled the people and had nothing to fear because in reality he had nothing to make him uncomfortable I imagine this means something like He had no resistance He wouldn t take personal insult to the sentiment and feelings of hate the public had for him nor the people that called him stupid He didn t care because the power that he felt was incredible and he learned to control the people with this emotion that he was devoid of I drop the ball big time translating this I understand the words but can t puzzle it together in solid english or meaning really sorry He was a leader among incredible men due to his ability to connect or tap into that anger in a way that moved his followed of course not just with this His charisma as well as his other emotions were so solid strong potent so immovable that is didn t matter what he was saying or talking about the people that FELT a certain way could connect with his emotions they are after all human feelings emotions He took this power and took advantage of and abused the people and I m not in agreement or on board with this Being compassionate with others is so much more beautiful to me and it could have been done in this manner Even though I m done expressing anger through my feelings I ve only just begun to feel this ultimately I was a very intelligent young child man growing up everybody saw the potential in me but they also saw that certain things affected me They learned how to make me feel in certain situations and when I wouldn t express myself with a lot of emotion I would frequently be recieve disconnection I think this means neglect or an act of being shunned perhaps and I would internalize this into anger but without expressing properly expressing myself I would only stay with resentment inside of me I would exteriorize express this resentment in different behaviors Sometimes I would act more important or intelligent than others or I would simply disconnect with others emotionally Human beings are like this we hold these feelings in that we receive from others and keep them in To justify our own self doubt we judge others we laugh and tease them we lose and lack compassion for other human beings and from these actions come disconnection war suicide and lives full of depression Human beings have things that we want to hide from others We feel shame and or embarrassment in regards to specific things in our lives We feel controlled by certain people and under this control from other people we rationalize these feelings others express towards us and vice versa I ll live the rest of my life attempting to connect with others and feel these emotions and feelings with them I hope to help heal this pain and heal the people from this pain that was extremely present in my life and has deprived me of these human emotions all of my life
holy shit i was reading this and was thinking that he sounded delirious and well tried to sound as though he has a deep knowledge of the english language but a lot of it was gibberish when i got to the end i had then realized it had been auto translated
Google translate is actually getting decent now Atleast for certain languages
Quas s spanish is like perfect grammatically and looks pretty clean and proper When written like this google translate can be pretty good
It was full of grammatical mistakes and weird sentence structure
Man as a spanish speaker reading that was painful as fuck S
His Spanish has really improved
He seems to be on a reflexive moment of his life trying to feel and concentrate in his emotions than overthinking Prolly because of this he got on a big argument saying the things that bother him and since he its not used to communicate this kind of stuff from what I read on the FB comment everything collapsed on a fight or something Maybe he tried LSD and got to realize things he never thought about because theres no other way s
That s a really odd statement So it doesn t seem like elo boosting since they specify an incident happened in the actual HQ Perhaps a personal issue between Quas and a liquid teammate Quas also makes it sound that he is all but gone for this season
The weirdest part about it is Quas s comment this was the better decision moving forward with my life and growing up It sounds like he took a deliberate action to this end rather than being punished for breaking some rule
Maybe he punched Piglet and after retrospection decided that yep would do it again 10 10
Only two things I can really think of are some type of physical verbal fight or misuse of the headquarter s internet property or something I doubt a simple elo boost or something would warrant that wording
from the wording it sounds more like maybe he got approached by another team and tried to let himself get poached without telling TL about it while under contract the timing makes that alot more likely as a speculation considering we still have 2 empty team slots with potential millionaires coming who need to fill them up
Even after the Badawi fiasco I d argue that people would be more cautious to not poach or be seen as poaching after that incident
Im super smart i ll be fine Said everyone ever
The ones not caught would also say it
An incident makes it seem like something serious I don t think it s a personal issue like two people had an argument Maybe a serious physical altercation
I kicked him with my leg
That s what I was thinking I mean tbf Quas looks like he could rek someone off the rift too
If it were elo boosting Riot would be involved They don t appear to be so it s nothing to do with an in game infraction
Add hurried to the list of odd things I m sad that Quas has apparently left Liquid but man am I curious about what the hell happened
Maybe one of his relatives is preparing a coup d etat and he is still waging if participating or not I can imagine it being difficult to participate in the LCS while trying to overthrow a goverment
Considering the situation here in Venezuela it s a real possibility lol
Do I need to remind you February 2014 It ain t happening shit here
I was mainly joking I clearly remember guarimbas and their lack of effect
Sarcasm is hard to catch when you haven t sleep in a good while
In before BIGSORRY 2 0
He got caught doing a line of coke off loco s penith
Just in case the website goes down here s the statement for Team Liquid and Quas It is with a very heavy heart that we announce Diego Quas Ruiz s suspension from Team Liquid This decision was made after an incident occurred this week at the Team Liquid HQ in Los Angeles We are reviewing all the details surrounding the event before making a final decision Steve Arhancet the owner of the team is personally engaged and working closely with with Diego and his family While we understand the desire for transparency we value Diego s privacy and we will be releasing further information as appropriate From Quas To all my fans I know this is sad to hear but this was the better decision moving forward with my life and growing up I hope that TL finds a suitable replacement and performs as well as I know they can this season I am very grateful to Team Liquid for giving me the biggest opportunity of my life and for letting me be a part of esports I wish everyone the best
Jesus i wonder what it could be sounds like a behavioral issue rather than a gameplay with the mention of an incident although of all the people on Liquid I didn t think it would be Quas
He probably switched from his HTC phone to an iPhone
How dare he I hope he didn t think ge would get away with this
Apple was too tempting
It s the garden of Eden all over again
He prolly banged owner s wife Savage
oh this kind of story is close to my heart Like the one where a woman can t pay for a delivery pizza
I seem to remember some plot like this where did I do tho
i m not sure where DID you do tho
it s always the quiet ones
Liquid deciding to test the resolve of the fans with this offseason So hard to stay a fan of this team given almost no roster moves and nothing announced coach wise so far Honestly this announcement is a slap in the face too The statements are extremely conflicting and this is the first news we hear from management since Smoothie signed
You got loco making videos I suppose haha
im dead
remember he s not crazy he s just loco
Yeah this is just really bizarre I m really not sure what to make of it The way the two statements are worded only makes it more confusing I respect they want to keep stuff private but the lack of anything coming from the team is pretty concerning as a fan
First statement sounds like he got kicked second like he wanted to leave The growing up statement is pretty ominous Quas done with league
Could this be Quas I mean I highly doubt it is but you never know
Screenshot of the post anywhere It s gone And many other comments say its a league player making me even more curious
https web archive org web 20150819020112 https reddit com r offmychest comments 3hgkvc lcs player really frustrated with my life
I wonder who E is The only member of Liquid with a name starting with E is one of their analysts Assuming it s actually Quas

So some years ago I got into the lcs which is the biggest League of Legends tournament in the world I don t want to give up names so let s say I was really good and got into a good team I m gonna use a throwaway and for this one Some of the stuff I ll say might hurt some people but I don t care I need to vent real hard I don t want to prove anything I say if it s a problem for you stop reading I changed some facts about me as well so don t bother please Sorry in advance for words words words Some background I was always nerdy as fuck and didn t have any plans or anything for the future still don t growing I was playing video games all the times Now I didn t have too many friends and you can guess why I m not a social guy and I still find it hard to deal with people It s not as hard as it was when I was a teenager but it s still is I wasn t really liked in school I wasn t hated either just another one of the nerds no one gives a fuck about Back then and especially where I grew up sports was a major thing at least for my peers I wasn t really into it and then with adolescent coming along I started to develop this superiority complex where I looked down at other people for being less smart than me Trust me it doesn t make me feel really good writing this but it was what it was A big part of that was sports Every time people tried to talk to me about it I would do this dumb reduction when you describe the game in the most offensive way possible Basketball 5 guys running after a ball WOW dude so amazing real contribution to the world these guys are so smart Yay irony since at the same time I got into esports Not too hard since back in the day it was actually hard to watch it and my internet wasn t amazing as well but I could still see people playing video games in ways I didn t know were possible Some of the things they did back in the day in Starcraft are amazing and it s real sad that new gamers who don t know startcraft won t be able to appreciate them It doesn t happen in sports jumping 2 meters in the air will always be amazing and doesn t matter how many years will pass I played Starcraft UT Quake and a little bit of dota CS All with a competitive mindset Some players play to have fun but If I wasn t actually improving it felt pointless to me Losing felt like shit and winning was everything unless I learned something from losing And then came League I got into it during beta and started pouring hours into it What drew me was the simplicity mostly and how good I was at it Back then everyone was shit which also helped people who took it seriously If you understood how to min max in games you were already better than 80 of players on the server I don t want to give too much detail but playing long enough and hard enough got me into the lcs It s a procces much harder nowadays but I made it because I was and still am real good Far from the top but good enough What you need to understand about league if you never played it is that compared to other games it s nothing The micro compared to starcraft is nothing The fast reflex compared to quake ut is nothing The teamwork compared to any team sport is nothing Like I started watching basketball with my brother two years ago and it dawned on me how much what I do for a living is a complete joke compared to what they do when it comes to teamwork Our team was doing fine the first year in the tournament and I got paid While people in my hometown sometime got menial jobs and shit I was getting money for playing videogames I was also noticed by girls which was actually huge for me I m past 20 and I still never had a girlfriend but at least while playing I m semi famous to those that give a fuck so I can look at girls and not feel bad I still look like shit from playing videogames all day but at least I don t feel like back when I was a teenager who convinced himself that girls are not important so he went home for final fantasy
I also got a lot of friends from the team and the scene people who could understand me because we had so much similar stuff happening to us and if you don t have that you can always talk video games And we continued to do good and that s another year and some more but eventually things started to get to me The biggest problem was playing the game for days on end to keep in shape it how fucking dumb and boring it felt to do it in this game of all games But it got me paid and I had a contract so no way I was gonna change I don t think I m even good enough for any other game perhaps except for hots Watch this classic with fatal1ty playing quake https www youtube com watch v XdkDjsBiO58 League doesn t have shit on that in terms of mechanics or reflex Not even close and this is a large map On small maps in a deathmatch it gets insane This level of skill needed in league is piss poor compared to that When It comes to strategy it s a fucking joke compared to dota when it comes teamwork it s a joke compared to basketball I want to say to people who don t know e sports that even if you think it s just a game it takes hours on fucking hours to be the best you need to practice No way to avoid it And doing it when you don t enjoy is like any other job And in the meantime I m surrounded by people who play this game all day And off course you talk league and compare it to other games and here s the funny part almost everyone agrees Like barely any argument on it The amount of disrespect you develop to the game you play for a living is so absurd to me Do athletes feel the same way about sports they do We read patch notes together usually a day after release to learn the new strats and we usually pinpoint exactly what s gonna happen to the game Oh boy Riot made tank items stronger now it s tank meta Oh boy Riot made ap assasisins weaker now it s ad assassins meta Like none of us give a fuck It s the same game we play they just changed the numbers Once you understand how it s designed there s nothing more for you to understand it s just a game of numbers And you don t get monetary compensated to compete you get it for participation and not getting eliminated As long as you re on the top half and not the winner it doesn t matter what you do You play so many games that don t really count for anything And we know we can do well enough to get where we need and we know we can t win so why even bother You see I don t feel like I m some amazing player on his way to the top of the world because I m not even in a real competition I can t play against my real opponents oversea enough to actually get good because of the way the only tournament I m allowed to participate in is structured that way I just can t practice enough to get good But the rest of the guys don t care We aren t players in a tournament We aren t paid to win We are given a salary each month by a company to play in their tournament where it doesn t matter what we do We are there to entertain we are entertainers And what we are paid for is to play in some huge advertisement for a solo q You see the game isn t meant for us It s designed around random people who never knew each other to group into a team rapidly and play as a team They don t need to speak between themselves because everything is handed to them by Riot who don t even give them a fucking voice chat to communicate Because they don t need it the game is simple enough to not need it The division into roles the dumb itemization the forced meta the features lacking the way the e sport is organized none of is about us It s about people who sit at home and want to play a pseudo competitive game while feeling they are on the way to become pros and I m selling it Because they look at me doing the same strategies they do and win games so obviously they are on the right path And if I m getting paid for it so that means the game must be complex and hard And like any game that isn t solved yet like tic tac toe or checkers can be played competitively that is if you pay people to do it If I pay you a million dollars to play Minecraft it doesn t make into a real competitive worthy title and it doesn t make it hard enough and complex enough to actually take it seriously It just means that somewhere around the world a team would be willing to spend a lot of time at a chance at getting paid When I talk on this with my team and other pros we pretty much agree on it People don t do it because they care about the game they do it for the fame and money and because it might help them to become streamers and actually make money from this There s simply not enough money in competitions so some people don t even care about competing as much as they care about the chance to make money from streaming what the fuck kind of attitude is that And I understand it I don t blame anyone I m not na ve I got to talk to some people who work for Riot not just artists or marketing and they know They know about the balancing issues and how it fucking really is just a roundabout of viable champion who do the same thing and get switched around with nerfs and they re ok with it The game remains exactly the same and it s fine because the game is not about us it s about the people who don t play enough or think enough about the game to notice nothing changed For them things changed because things look different And it doesn t matter what we think since we are employs with a contract who aren t dumb enough to speak out and ruin our public image Last year the jungle was changed so people got excited Neutrals were changed with all sort of bells and whistles around it Now most players think it s a big deal because for them if it looks different than it is different but we know that the net effect of the change was almost zero The jungle gives the same things it did before even if some things behave a little different So what the fuck am I doing playing this I m not saying it got me depressed because there are so many things to it beside playing a video game and I hate people who self diagnose on the internet It s not clinical I m just tired of playing a shit game for a living I m tired of feeling like an advertisement and I feel I m wasting time I should probably start some online college courses or something just to feel my life is going somewhere I also had someone I m somewhat close to die which made me think about stuff I m not even sad or angry when playing I m just following a known pattern and win No big outplays or skill just do my thing and win The player count for league has actually plateaued or possibly went down in the past year and half which is expected I think But it does make you think that it will die eventually and if now there s no real career in it for you then when will it have Some of my friends think about it as a cash grub and don t care about the future but I do I guess I will never be good enough to be 1 and I won t ever move to Korea to practice there or something I don t think anyone on my team even cares about it anymore I went a con with fighting games small tournament with no real prize Talking to fans you see they care The con wasn t about Nintendo it was about the game Not a single add for that trash company cause it s not about them it s about the game and the players who love it When I talk to mine I just want to sit them down and explain to them how League is designed instead of the bullshit they re sold Let them decide once they have the full picture I m rambling I know sorry Like holy hell half the PR Riot does has nothing to do with the game Shit youtube videos long fluffy paragraphs on why they don t want to work harder The same time a competing game has an 18 million dollar tournament and a new engine client they tell the fans that practicing in sandbox is bad and I just knew it I m so fucking used to this dismissive nonsense I m locked in a job that is too good to leave and I don t have any skills that could help me find another I know I m young and I can leave and do things with my life but it s really easier said than done I m lucky to get paid as much as I do with my resume and I should be grateful for it I m tired of two faced people who sell the fans that it s a hard game with complex strategies when other games do what League does better And they go to me and joke about how dumbed down it is If the fans had any idea what some of the guys I know really think about league and how much more they appreciate dota cs and starcraft like shit that would be both funny and sad to see But I love some of them they re my friends and I m also getting paid to say the same thing or shut up about others I ve talked to my family about it and it comes down to it that it s better to think about the future and what you want to do while you have job instead of doing it unemployed Also E I m happy that you came out and everything worked out well but you really need to chill and talk less about LGBT rights and stuff No nice way to say it you keep derailing every conversation to that topic It s important and I fully support you but really stop injecting LGBT issues to everything I m lucky to have you as a friend but damn
It is also a strange coincidence the top comment was from xpecial telling him to reach out to him Like you said really unlikely but I also wouldn t be surprised if it was him
It sounds like it could possibly be him because of the original post s https web archive org web 20150819020112 https reddit com r offmychest comments 3hgkvc lcs player really frustrated with my life found by piegie mention of shitty internet during his early gaming years which he has said in interviews about Venezuela But this does seem to be a logical complaint for people who go into fun video game gig and come out realizing it s a job like any other
I don t think so because of this line I still look like shit from playing videogames all day but at least I don t feel like back when I was a teenager Quas obviously lifts and works on his physical appearance EDIT I understand people have subjective views of their own appearance but my personal interpretation of this statement is that the author who clearly avoided sports of all kinds in his younger day does not put value in physical exertion and that is inconsistent with Quas s physique An interpretation in which he wrote that to throw people off his trail is rather far fetched in my opinion
I m not sure those are exclusive He could lift and feel like he looks like shit despite his efforts because of his job
And if he suffers from depression it would not matter if he is attractive or not he would feel like shit anyways
Its relative to everyone you could be good looking but still be complexed cause you know some ppl that are even prettier and attract more girls
also keep in mind he was trying to distort some facts to keep his identity a mystery
Here is a paste of the original post It is too long to just paste here http pastebin com 3ZtH2EgJ
Hey you might actually be onto something here
I like the way this is basically a collection of lol pros anyway I doubt it s quas though xpecial himself was commenting in the thread
This seems plausible
17 pages on my desk by monday tyvm
Tangentially related but did dyrus ever drop the bomb like he warned before
Nope it ended up just being a tumblr post where he sort of hinted at the problem being more with casters analysts than players in the scene themselves but he chose not to actually drop the bomb
Nah he decided to do the mature thing and not burn every damn bridge possible
there better be at least 5 5 fucking k words on that essay or else he going to get another punishment
or else hes donezo
Quas I ll play Fiora Piglet No bitch you play Maokai Quas Fvck you I m done being your bitch I quit Steve Quas you re suspended Quas To all my fans I know this is sad to hear but this was the better decision moving forward with my life and growing up I hope that TL finds a suitable replacement and performs as well as I know they can this season I am very grateful to Team Liquid for giving me the biggest opportunity of my life and for letting me be a part of esports I wish everyone the best
Forcing someone to play Maokai Now thats just cruel
One retired this year Oh my god we found the reason
that was lulu friend
FNC Quas Quas YES
FNC Quas Cabo YES
FNC Quas Rekkles Seee ya
Why would they take Seiya Dude can t even win a 1v1 tournament
Quas didn t pass the drug test on IEM
Sherlocks grab your hats Is it weed suicide attempt beat the living shit outa piglet prostitutes Its not elo boost cause then Riot would be the one suspending
What did he do Did he forget to flush
Worse He put the toilet paper the wrong way around
If I were to guess Quas is still under contract but he is negotiating with other teams TL found out and suspended him We know from the Badawi scandal that Quas didn t like TL for various reasons and wanted out
I don t think Quas would try to pull that we saw what riot will do to people suspected of poaching and how hefty of a fine anyone involved will incur
Genuine question Is it still poaching if Quas initiates conversation Ala he isn t approached by any teams but he actively searches to leave
If Quas skype messages Regi and says yo lemme join tsm it s not poaching If Regi says yeah lets talk about it without telling the owner of team liquid then it s poaching In perspective it s actually a really simple rule it s amazing how often people break it
Smoothie confirmed on stream that Quas is not transferring to another team
yea suspend him so he can finalise his negotiations with the other team
Quas appears to be a really respectable dude Wonder what happened that would result in his suspension
inb4 quas deal drugs to the players
Diego Quas Ruiz Escobar
Adderall or is that C9 only
r GlobalOffensive is leaking
Get back to work
And he was afraid to get caught at IEM since they drug tested Darshan
No Zionspartan failed his and that s why Darshan had to play
Just the way it sounds from both sides is weird They are suspending quas and informing his family of the incident But with him also saying wanting to move on and stuff it s really weird Also for them to say it just occur means it s like they caught him I d say drugs or attempt to suicide
DRAMA TRAIN INC HERE WE GO BOIZ
we didnt milk enough drama out of dyrus s retirement and doublelift moving to TSM so the drama gods have graced us with this
I WANT TO GET OFF MR OFFSEASONS WILD RIDE
BUT YOU RE A CLG FAN

CHOO CHOO MOTHER FUCKER
Piglet You get me Impact yes We rebuild SKT in NA
Impact T0M Easyhoon Piglet Piccaboo
if you could have that many imports do you really think TSM would have americans
tsm has americans
This is rather sudden If it s as serious as it sounds getting into another team is going to be hard I hope he isn t forced into moving back to Venezuela because of likely a stupid rash action
He just got his green card approved as well
I would like to get off the off season train please
Thank you for choosing LCS Drama Train Next stop Team Liquid Quas Drama
https www facebook com CrsQuas posts 529237557235527 Quas s recent facebook post probably related to this So weird
Now we wait for Doublelift to leak the truth Cmon Liftlift
Quas got told he couldn t play Swain top by Piglet and knocked Piglet out
I could see him casually one shotting someone lol
Please remember that Riot employees will never ask for your password when assisting you
Very odd statement It sounds like something happened in real life as they decided to specify that it happened in the TL house Hard to imagine Quas would be one to cause trouble but the statement is so vague it doesn t really give any insight as to what the nature of the incident was or why it would cause him to be suspended Maybe an injury EDIT Also it doesn t make much sense considering the TL statement mentions that a final decision has not been made but Quas says he s retiring I mean perhaps Quas really injured something and doesn t want to play even if TL okays him Seems like bad PR to make a statement that doesn t allow fans any insight other than Quas may or may not play next split but he says he s not going to but we ll make the decision and maybe we ll release some other details of an unspecified type
If I had to guess based on the info given I d say that it was something about Quas himself Maybe he has had some mental trouble which culminated in some fashion He or the org might ve reached out for his family afterwards hence they were mentioned The Liquid organisation isn t sure if this is something that will pass so they didn t want to kick him out The alteration itself could be anything But saying that they want to keep it wrapped for Quas sake might suggest that it wasn t something between him and someone else rather something he has done to himself Maybe some people were partial to whatever happened but that would still be secondary
Man as a Venezuela league player lcs follower and quas fan I am very sad Quas has always been an outstanding player person in the league scene He earned his fan base in the recent years since he joined Curse and then Liquid by himself through his amazing gameplay and game knowledge but keeping always a good posture and humble actitude I imagined Quas as very intelligent mature logic and even sociable person This is what I felt from watching him on LCS and a variety stream sessions However reading Quas Facebook post looks like he is not too much as I imagined He seemed some suppressed keeping anger and with some kind of depression I think he has probably been depressed on a suicide mood or medicine drugs abuse lately that s why family is involved Even in some responses on Facebook he has been to serious negative to another Venezuelan comments which were jokes very common in our country and even more in his hometown Maracaibo What I hope is this whole situation not being about Venezuelan problems I mean I hate Chavez and he did a lot of bad stuff here But I wouldn t give up with my dream for anybody I know the world sometimes can be mean people throwing anger envy hate etc to you but you gotta know there are good intelligent reasonable people who gives you anything but happiness joy and strength I wish him best of luck and I hope his career is not over PS I read his Facebook post and I really did not get what he tried to achieve
He was sick of Donald Trump s incendiary comments about minorities and Latin American people so he accepted the payment from El Chapo to take him out
Quas is probably working with the mexican boosting cartel
I knew it was too good for TL to remain untouched from the drama They weren t done after the whole Xpecial debacle But in all seriousness I m sad about this Having both Xpecial and Quas off the TL roster kind of leaves me with less reason to support them now I like Dom and Fenix still but the roster has gone a long way from the 2014 Summer Curse roster that I fell in love with
For those that don t know there is a lot of political turmoil that is happening in Venezuela currently Just the other day the opposition leader in Venezuela was murdered while campaigning Chavez was a leader that took over many years ago He nationalized the oil in Venezuela and drove away a lot of Western money Many of the rich in Venezuela fled leaving a very poor oil based economy which often leads to a poor distribution of wealth As a result the crime rate has sky rocketed and political opposition is often dangerous They have shut down opposition press and arrested opposition politicians I don t know how much this has to do with Quas but it definitely clears up a suicidal Facebook post that he wrote earlier He sees Chavez as an amazing man that misused his power
it was bound to happen the stone cold killer quas has killed a teddy bear
Damn I wonder what happened I felt like Quas never got a chance to shine on TL with them putting him on tanks most games and not letting him play carry tops We didn t even get to see him play in the top lane carry meta because they didn t make worlds
The Return to the Top Starring the Kid
Sounds like he had a fight with someone or some heavy argument He ll probably be shopped around to other teams now Steve seems like a cool guy to do that
It doesn t seem like many people are getting the feeling of the wording of his facebook post and the wording of the article that this could have been an suicide attempt We re working with him AND his family The facebook article also leads me to feel that way as well It reminds me of how self reflective you can be when you re in that state of mind and especially how you feel after It would make sense to be suspended for now if that s the case and from the wording of his post that he is done with League as well Hope things are going well outside of this for him though
I don t think a suicide attempt would lead them to use the term suspension I think they would use something that sounded less punitive like leave of absence
How the fuck can there be 2000 fucking comments in this thread but nothing of substance and absolutely no relevant info
He asked to play a carry champion in scrims Piglet was having none of that
Quas has really bad allergies during the winter months Unfortunately IWD had his stash nearby and Quas sneezed it all over the carpet TL is all over IWD s D and the rest is history
Man I bet that fucker tried to play a carry champion smh
I was gonna say TIL that Quas discovered mushrooms as a joke but some people did it before but in a serious manner That s sad why do people jump on conclusion so early That s quite the bad side of Reddit Anyway from what I ve understood from his post he seem to had some kind of revelation maybe he went to Venezuela during his time off and discovered he no longer wanted to be pro for whatever reasons Given his post he seems like a really intelligent dude maybe a bit too much on the emphasis way but given his age it s totally understandable If he had discovered a passion in his life even if it s unrelated to league I m glad for him he seems like a cool dude But please Reddit don t jump on conclusion about a man entire life before things are cleared up a bit
Well I hope it s not for too long then even though it sounds like it is but I guess IEM Cologne is out of question this year as well for them
He makes it sound like he is done with the scene I really hope not I always thought he was the best player on liquid and definitely the nicest Really hope he stays in esports
Thanksgiving dinner is the root of all of this Some shit went down just like happens to normal families
Quas killed Fishy
He is a great player destroys everyone I see him in solo q and never rages super nice hope he gets played again he is great
LOOKS LIKE FOURTH MIGHT BE HARDER THIS SEASON
This seems bizarre and it s a massive blow to the NA scene and TL specifically This will be a drama bomb
His elongated Facebook post about facing depression anger management and his study and admiration of Hugo Chavez makes this all very weird I think he got in a physical altercation and may have been on drugs It s very shady and it s clearly something that is enough of a problem that it may be the end of his career the way he s talking
second post highly voted that I read saying he supported Chavez the opposite he said he admires Chavez for having much control over people using anger as a motivation and so on but by no means he is on Chavez s side It is the same about what the world thinks about Hitler he was a smart good leader controlled people and so on but people seeing those qualities doesn t mean they love himMy heart dropped for a second reading this title
Mine too Been refreshing this subreddit hourly in fear of losing KaSing Thought this was it
I thought he was subbing for Fnatic during all stars For a moment I thought allstars was like MSI
I miss something
Kasing trying out with TSM at IEM Kasing going back to Europe with no official statement on whether he is contracted with TSM or not Sudden announcement about Kasing replacing an EU player For Allstars
it s because of the 2 player rule ex dyrus bjergsen and tsm member 3 are voted in for all stars only dyrus and bjergsen can go because only two members per team can participate since it s huni and rekkles playing i wouldn t say kasing is replacing yellowstar
I was more worried for Yellowstar
though i was the only one

Wasnt it already decided that huni and Rekkles was gonna go from fnatic So ys could not go
tbh I d really want to see YS instead of Huni for all stars
Out of any combination of Rekkles Forgiven Niels Freeze Yellowstar Mithy Kasing my fellow voters literally chose the worst one possible We could have had Forgiven Mithy or Niels Yellowstar
Freeze and Mithy We NiP now
Bans incoming
Much rather have Niels and yellowstar for the fact that I ll be at event and get a chance to meet them while Lasing will be in the NA LCS next split Also I thought Niels was a more impressive player that Origen built around
hes their shining star atm
Him and mithy played super well at worlds for sure a world class bot lane
Everybody on fire right now
Also depressing in terms of best player that we got Peke and Rekkles instead of Febiven and Niels
This is a common missconception i guess This is not real competition you vote for your fav player not for the best so usually the most popular attend
I d rather see xPeke at All Stars having fun last time as player in his competitive career than some young player who still has future in front of him
I thought Froggen would had gone if Niels would had beaten Rekkles
it s funny how ppl keep threating xPeke like a retired player even if he didn t retire and will play next season
He might not given PoE s excellent performance at IEM he might decide to step down completely
Do you really believe that I think keeping xPeke in the team is more like a marketing move than an actual Faker Eazyhoon situation He probably won t play much
He s pulling a Regi Find a replacement with lots of potential growth Sit back and watch your team play develop the brand cash fat checks
we have dyrone and hai Dyrone is playing overwatch and fallout4 right now Hai just invites people to play board games every now and then on stream you think you know the deal you don t bitch
Literally every team isn t the best possible I was just describing one scenario Korea has the Season 2 legacy botlane China has only one Korean which might admidetly give them better communication and if I m not mistaken LMS is sending Toyz over Maple
Cabo Amazing Febiven Niels Yellowstar The dream You can put Odo instead of Cabo Huni would be fine too but i would put Febi and Yellowstar higher than him
Ye Niels should have won or Forgiven But Forgiven doesn t have enough fans as they just follow big teams and good personalities Not skill
Forg1ven got himself banned like a moron that certainly takes skill
Niels is not a lot better than rekkles rekkles played utility adc in worlds niels played hyper carry every game so it s difficult to say Rekkles has a lot of experience with different teams and that is valuable too The difference between febi and peke is too big febiven is the best player now by far
Rekkles almost always plays utility You could say that s because of the team dynamics but looking back in history he has always been performing better when he isn t the main focus but has two strong solo laners
I have a very good feeling that if they tried to put rekkles on a hyper carry role at worlds he would of choked hard
Well he played Jinx in 2 games against EDG and had no problems there
now to make the same excuse for china that everybody does with sandbaggining but china heavily under performed at worlds
They did sure They also likely just weren t quite as good as many including myself thought The chance that the 3 best teams all collectively slumped heavily at the exact same time is not very reasonable honestly Additionally EDG wasn t as good as they were at MSI but they weren t utter shit either
I wouldn t say Freeze is better than Rekkles in those comparaisons though Don t feel like you can put Freeze on top of him confidently Just because he is seemingly the only shining light of his team doesn t make him better than the Rekkles we got since the playoffs imho
I honestly don t understand how Rekkles got such high votes unless the Fantic fanboys leapt all over it Would ve really liked to see Forg1ven play
Allstars is just for FUN i dont care
But offseason drama
me too cabo instead of huni and keep yellow or Forgiven instead of Rekkles and keep yellowstar It would be great to see Godgiven and yellow decimate enemy botlanes One can dream
my dream was huni and YS so that forgiven would go
I assume YS was replaced instead of Huni due to of votes But i could be wrong
Me too
Nah Huni is a lot of fun to watch I think he would be fun to see in this type of environment where it is semi serious yet semi show off
Yeah it seems like OP is a bit of a slowpoke lmao
Yeah KaSing has been listed as the starter since the All Star rosters were announced haha Not sure why OP decided to post this and why people up voted it
This isn t really new you can only have 2 members from one team and Huni Rekkles got more votes than YS
what is this Huni ciclejerk he deserved this spot ITS SEASON 5 all stars not season 6 or preseason huni hate is real
Ikr and mostly from FNC flairs too good to see a level headed FNC fan
Bandwagoners as soon as a player leaves their team they bash him And as soon as they bandwagon into a new team they bash their old team
not necessary fans of Fnatic brand or Fans of one of the other players don t need to love Huni just because he was also on the team Huni left his team so team fans also leave him Natural thing to happen
It s one thing to stop caring about a player and other to start hating bashing him for leaving your team
So like real sports You think if Messi left Barcelona for Man City the Barcelona fans would be so level headed It is what it is
As a United fan this would be the worst timeline
Being angry is one thing Saying Messi was so overrated he was the biggest weakness of Barca would be ridiculous
I don t know Most people maybe wanted to see Yellowstar more than Huni Yes he deserved the spot but that does not mean that FNC cannot be sad that he goes instead of Yellowstar
Would be fun to go back in the history of some the fnc flairs in this thread and read all the good shit they said about huni back in the day top 3 worlds favorite player etc
All last season Huni is the best top in the west Now soAZ Cabo Odo Youngbuck were better all long anyway
They weren t better all along but at least soaz was definitely better starting from playoffs
During all season you couldn t hear the end of his hype And now he s a shit top laner that chokes and Cabochard can totally rekt his ass he s literally the only reason FNC didnt go to finals Some people are fake af
To be fair Huni tilted enough to change Earth s orbit
I don t really want to see Huni at allstars either Not because he isn t great or didn t deserve it he did It s just weird to have someone play for the EU LCS when he isn t part of it anymore
Obviously he deserved his spot but imo Yellowstar deserves it more
Well i prefer Huni over Yellowstar so i guess i can be happy
every player that leaves fnatic gets a stupid amount of hate and everyone starts saying he was a bad player look at rekkles for example this sub is still salty about it
It s also because for the later part of summer split and worlds he wasn t really that impressive I m not saying he doesn t deserve it but it s not just because he s leaving Fnatic
Because he is not part of EU anymore He lost his slot the moment his signed with NA
I read that as kaSing being the new support for Fnatic and my heart skipped a beat
The love xPeke Makes me happy Sad sOAZ didnt get to go
soAz himself posted on twitter that he didn t want to get voted in for All stars
Jesus as soon as i saw Kasing replaces Yellowstar i tought it was an annoucement of YS retiring Thank god that is not the case
Wasn t this know for a week already Because of the no more than 2 players from the same team rule
Why is this even gathering so much attention This was know like a week ago or more
Ah that explains a lot I knew it for days I saw the title and I was wondering if I had confused something else with kasing in EU allstars and accidentally knew the future for the past days
Wow this Huni is bad and Cabbochard is better circlejerk is driving me insane And just because he left Like someone said in another comment people with his dick still in their breath are shitting on him C mon dont be so salty He was the best toplaner in the west last season Also I dont really agree that forgiven is such a god but thats justan opinion divergence
Jesus Christ I m on edge worried about TSM grabbing Yellowstar and I see kaSing Yellowstar and replace in one sentence
i think the chance of that happening is 0 001 He seems super loyal to Fnatic and probably thinking of retiring before changing to another team
It would have been like Dyrus going to Fnatic just no chance honestly
Or Doublelift going to TSM odds of that are slim if not zero
dank
Yeah or like Doublelift going to TSM
touch
true fnatic needs a good top laner

I have no hard feelings towards Huni or Kasing but honestly it sucks that they re representing EU the vote would ve went a lot differently if their moves were public knowledge
This Eu line up with 2 players who left for Na
This was already announced no
Really like only top 3 team players come on man where s froggen where s freeze
Maybe the fans thought those players were part of their team s struggles since it s a team sport
O shit so who s TSM s sup now again
Mithy is like yellowstar 2 0 so how come he not getting more votes
wouldve much preferred to see niels instead of rekkles and YS or mithy instead of kasing
I think the reason why some europeans feel betrayed by Huni is quite difficult to understand for Americans Americans tend to faster see a foreign person as one of their own Look at the support teams LMQ en players as Bjergsen get Europe is way more stubborn in this so when they accepted Huni and Reignover as Europeans it is a bigger emotional invesment Hence the feel of betrayal
your explanation can be simplified to yo mate we europeans just hate immigrants
You re actually right Europe is heavily xenophobic even among other european countries
The amount of times i ve seen fellow europeans give out racial slurs for Italians Frenches Germans Brits Spaniards etc is far more than the amount I hear Americans say racial slurs for Europeans or Central Americans South Americans asians etc Basically if you re french chances are you don t like people that aren t french and being in france before I can tell you that they straight up hate foreigners the amount of times I got called out while there was absurd but in my trip to chicago everyone was friendly and strangers even came up to me to help with directions just from hearing my conversation with someone else These are two isolated cases of course but I have travelled around and seen similar things in both Europe and the United States
Yup
I m from NA and I don t see foreign league players as our own however the LMQ org based itself in NA there for I supported them because they represented NA on an international stage
Seeing EU s roster and not being Cabhochard ReignOver Febiven Niels and Mithy makes me sad
As much as i love Huni or Reignvoer it just feels weird to have them on the EU roster for Allstars especialy since they are off to another region already
They re representing EU for the year 2015 which they played their entire career in Not for 2016 As far as this is concerned They haven t played in NA and have only played in EU
imo amazing reignover
You can only have 2 players from a team and I would take Niels and Mithy over Amazing
Jankos both
Loulex everyone
My votes were Cabo Jankos Febi Niels Mithy
Gimme Yellowstar instead of Huni He leaves EU he doesnt deserve it Hate me if you want buts my opinion
That s stupid He earned by playing well not because of his loyalty lol
he earned by being popular lol if the most voted players were the better ones the EU team would be pretty different
And he was popular because he played well
he was popular because of the amount of air time riot gave him with the holo sort of shit he also did play very well when he wasn t tilting he was flashy as fuck and did retarded shit that shouldn t work but somehow did and allowed fnatic to come back in many situations but he helped create those situations in the first place which is why people are not saying he aint that good he ll probably crush most NA top laners though even if he doesn t try hard like he seems to not want to do from his recent statements
Ah yes suddenly Huni is not great since he left the team He was consistent all split long he just got outplayed during worlds in some matches Doesn t suddenly negate all the times he carried FNC during the regular season Huni hate is really stupid in this topic
It s seriously from just fnatic fans that I hear this but I hear it so much They all think that Huni was some choke artist that tilted all the time in the regular seasons He legit only tilted twice during worlds and these fnc fans give him this title of being a tilter
They are just salty fans I m a FNC fan and I totally loved Huni played all season long But I have to admit that he way more cocky than he should have been and he deserve his spot as a top and as FNC and we shouldn t forget that it s fan that voted for him
Well since his last performance at Worlds was extremely underwhelming that is what people will remember
Sure someone gave him 3 times more money because he did retarded shit and not because he is actually a very good player
qtpie
I agree with you don t listen to the other guy the salt levels are too high in hi
He was clearly the best top in eu
he earned it by being the best top laner in EU last split
He was popular cause he played for FNC Same thing would happen if the most random challenger player would join TSM as starter
removed
I don t hate you I just think you re stupid He played well last split and people loved him His options should be closed because he played on your favorite team for one season
Didn t he leave because he could make 3x more money in other team if that s the case i dont see any reason for the hate huni is getting since leaving FNC unless i missed somthing he did said reddit went from loving the guy to full hate overnight
Most of these commenters have probably never paid a bill in their life and seem to be deluded into thinking that being on a well performing team means a lifelong career in esports This is especially untrue for Koreans who very rarely manage to gain any traction in the industry after their compulsory military service Something I would wager many commentaters also don t know about
same thing happened to rekless when he joined Alliance i don t understand reddit sometimes
deleted
He left EU he should not be representing EU at Allstars
Dyrus left the game completely and he is still representing NA
Yeah and Kasing played for tsm a NA team Not complaining about him Jesus fuck this sub is retarded
Wait aren t people saying yellow should play instead of kasing
I agree with this logic but many people just started disliking him after he left FNC and im not sure why
The criticism he has been subject to has only been growing during the last months it s not like people started hating or whatever all of a sudden tbh
Not quite true People were already getting tired of his attitude that was costing his team games He was incredibly cocky he took stupid risks when ahead that eventually made him die and ruined a safe victory for his team all because he wanted to be the star of the game When behind he also just tries to be a star again and feeds harder It was already happening in groups and people saw it as a big flaw that would eventually bite him in the ass Now he decides to leave EU for a higher salary in NA Probably thinks he can solocarry a team to worlds Just like Bjerg did
I think a lot of it is because fnatic always seemed like such a tight nit group of friends and a real unit in all the life of legends was that the fnatic one episodes Put that along with them probably being the best team eu has ever had and fnatic vs origen potentially becoming the second coming of m5 vs clg eu and you can see why a lot of people would become attached to the team Then huni leaving the team really came out of nowhere and took all of that away from them and they feel like the rugs been pulled out from under them I still think fnatic will be super good next split with the right additions but it won t be the same team that people have fallen in love with
Okay then neither should Kasing
It s S5 all stars tho
It s S5 Allstars and he played for EU for all of S5
exactly Thats all No hate for Huni but he should not represent Europe thats it EDIT also he said i will show that EU is better then NA and now he goes over the sea Thats maybe a reason many guys hate him
Kasing
2015 all stars for 2 0 1 5 players idiot
wtf why are people so salty that huni is leaving Man reddit did a complete 180 on huni after worlds did they already forget how huni carried fnatic troughout the spring and summer LCS with strong lane presence and great TP flanks
I reckon it s just that he is supposed to be going to NA that is pissing off all of us EU fans Also the most recent game he played is clearly the most memorable
YellOwStaR carried Fnatic throughout the season not Huni At Worlds Huni and Reignover threw the games in semifinal they re no longer playing in Europe so it s quite obvious why they lost some fans
I wouldn t have thought this comment to be so upvoted Sad stuff from the EU teenagers
So Dyrus shouldn t go because he s retired HAH
LOL I get to finally laugh I voted Cabo Febiven Jankos Forg1ven Yellowstar funny how no one of those players go
Fucking hope Huni refuse to go and Cabochard take his spot Tired of all Huni fanboys
I just wanted febiven to go T T
In a fun competition we might see some awesome champs and starts from peke But yeah Febiven should have gone He deserves it
holy shit same The guy is legitimately a top 3 mid laner in the world but instead xPeke is going god damn popularity contests
that s literally the whole fucking point of an all star tournament
Trade xpeke febiven and rekkles Niels and we actually have a GOOD team instead of a popular one
I m tired of Huni haters
Please not Huni and take YS What the fuck
HOLY FUCKING SHIT For a moment there I thought Kasing was replacing Yellowstar on Fnatic
When I first read this I almost had a heart attack because I thought it said kaSing replace Yellowstar in Fnatic
I read kaSing replace Yellowstar in EU LCS
i read this really wrong and almost shit my pants hardcore
i was hopping to see an announcement for rekkles to let go his spot there is no way fnatic will be able to attend cologne well prepared if rekkles spends the previous week at the allstars event safe to assume they will win the vote for EU
This news was already released Lol esports or somebody made an article that was frontpage soon after the voting results were released
The first time I saw this title for a second thought that KaSing replaces Yellow in Fnatic I almost got a heartattack altough he is one of the few that can replace him If Rekkles and Kasing match well they might aswell want to sign him in if Yellowstar decides to retire after all
Just me that red it like Alistars like 10 alistars roaming around u cant milk those
This is not a new infrmation taht was realeased when vote was ended a team can only have 2 players for all stars
I just noticed the LMS time for all stars is 4 20AM Ayyyy lmao rito
wasnt this already posted weeks ago
yeah we know but will he be on TSM
why didn t yall vote for mithy
deleted
Yea fuck fans Your opinion should be all that matters
As a offended I am fan
why are we even voting
I wonder why almost no one voted for Vander
Votes are rigged especially for the ADC role when Niels was in the lead True fans definitely did not want to see Rekkles in the All Star They should also have a rule to include only one player from one team to participate
With all these replacings they never should ve been fanvoted in the first place Seriously thats just senseless
For a moment I thought he was replacing Yellowstar Fnatic
kaSing is a traitor
Is this fnatics way to say yellow is leaving so they are trying the Rekkles Kasing synergy
I tope Huni doesn t take the spot so that SoaZ goes so that yellowstar goes so that froggen goes
im 100 positive soaz wouldn t want to take a spot away from one of his teamates
He even said that he didn t want to go
this roster sux China will must carry hard team Ice
China is terrible though
v true So sad we didn t get Cabochard Reignover Febiven Niels Mithy
None of the ADCs attending will stand a chance against Uzi and Pyl in laneYes we need a good twitch skin with particles Not for a while cuz of SSW tho D
LMAO
Ryze i COMPLETELY forgot about anfd Sion needs a skin I said champs with vus already He just hasn t been out for too long
why
Ah never played it xD
Meh 100 HP helps
who
I started in mid S3 and I m about 3 5 done
Umm maybe he SAW the post Also what u did is stupid as well bro
Riven Illoa
Only in PIT
With bexp Gareth is a beast dude
I m dissapointed because of all the nerfs to it The healing and the speed aren t nearly as good as before and while it IS a positive change I think it should scale with game length like every 5 minutes the speed and heals ramp up capping at a decent amount better than the old one at 50 minutes
Looks lie the one i got on day 1
Replace Ike with Shulk and u have the stock at my local gamestop
So are Falcon Fox Shulk Lucario Mac and Greninja Also r amiibo
Isnt he the guy from dbz that looks like mewtwo I like it

How is this nsfwis it comfortable how reginald likes it
wowow liandry s zed
maybe you should make a thread of champions who can proc certain items o gl giving up life
sorry if you feel that way
actually jinx is an awesome champion even if you fall behind early you get your head straight farm a bit get 2 items and carry that shiit alone
i think people only like when they are stomping enemy team that s why when that doesn t happen people tend to phreak out and go all berserk
if people are toxic to you just mute him case solved you wont be bothered and you will keep to play the game u love
made mashed potatoes C
thanks for sharing your opinion it s really sad that i myself mute alot of people after their ragy comments in game personally i hate losing but i rather lose a good game than win a game with people hating their team their colleagues their short time friends for 20 to 40 minutes

Doublelift Actually i never left CLG i m just subbing for TSM CLG Doublelift will never die rush hour baby
i dont have a fucking clue
yes there is without any basic knowledge of the game like csing knowing how to play atleast 3 roles cuz you maybe need to fill if you go in blindly to rankeds without knowing what to expect you will regret doing it and have a hard time
ok ask 10 questions to a gold elo player then ask the same 10 questions to a bronze player and check your results
as i said until you reach diamond 1 you suck not just you everyone lower than that dont get disapointed watch streams check patch notes for what is the strongest atm make proper building paths you ll eventually get it right
That happens if you queue up with someone else solo q elo doesnt matter maybe in your early days reaching level 30 you lost a bunch check how many wins defeats you have maybe that s the source of your problem
First of dont play rankeds if you aren t good practice in normals a few champions till u know their abillities and limits then transfer that to rankeds you will feel the difference Second not everyone are smurfs maybe they have a good game you don t know yet who plays good or not trust me if you really think they are smurfs just report them after for cheating dont talk ever in all chat getting tilted makes things worse Till you reach Diamond 1 you don t know anything about the game Propz and GL ELONo it isn t but that s why it would be a quality of life change my good sir
Nothing wrong with admitting your bronze It s like a gold I player saying as a gold plat player If you re gold you re gold If you re silver you re silver etc
This was entirely my fault sounds much better
Bronze
I m not an expert but I think I know why Laning is all about trading poking someone when they go for a cs knowing when you will out damage the opponent at certain points etc Miss Fortune rewards players who trade correctly immensely Her sustained damage is terrible on single targets She is all about poking them with an auto q Miss Fortune forces enemies to always be aware of where they are in lane even more so than usual If she lands a double up on a low health minion executes it and you re there to take the second shot It will do about 1 3 of your hp LEVEL 1 It s absolutely insane However I don t think she s op She is easily counter able by simply standing in the right spots It s like with playing a blitzcrank except you need to learn another pattern of positioning for yourself It s not played much in high elo because people position themselves correctly and don t take short trades with her short trades are the ones she dominates effectively making her useless
But you should be able to turn off vsync at high settings Why sacrifice graphics for no input lag when your cpu and gpu can push out the high settings edit added gpu
Who cares less than 1 of the people who truly love this game even have it Salt
Tahm kench soraka lulu kindred
She is a decent adc imo She s like the soraka of ad carries her w heals are INSANE
Stop making excuses because you don t know how to play against her Her e is one of the slowest skill shots in the game if you let her lane it you deserve to be punished for it What happened to the good ol days of punishing people for landing hard to hit abilities People just don t know how to react when they get hit with an e They panic and either walk out of range which makes them a vessel or they all in which gives extra 30 50 of damage depending on level I never seen anyone react to me landing an illaoi e the way they are supposed to You need to play as you would play against a blitz If she lands an e you have to ask yourself this Can she kill it If the answer is yes then get out of range asap as to avoid the damage that you don t need to take If the answer is NO then stay in range to take the damage that you deserve for letting her land it and avoid becoming a vessel The only time you should go in on an Illaoi when she has a soul up is when you are confident that you can out trade her You will not out trade her if you line up with her and the soul
Who cares it will allow you to cast an ability faster which in turn will allow them to live
As u jplovato said people would just run under tower when they are a vessel effectively making being a vessel useless
It s like playing against a malphite don t stay grouped up together so her ult isn t as powerful
Oh my god
5ms becomes quite annoying when you get used to 1ms You simply notice the difference and it is extremely annoying I actually have a 5ms right next to my 1ms 144 hz and I can tell the difference It s okay however because I don t use the other monitor for anything other than google chrome
I d say a basic 15 radiator is necessary otherwise your cpu s life will be shortened tremendously Here s a cheap but usable one
You can get the GTX 970 for 300 The model you are buying is overpriced Here is one for 289 With the money saved with that I would recommend buying ddr4 memory or upgrade to an i7 and buy liquid cooling If you choose to upgrade to ddr4 then you should buy a radiator Here from newegg is a cpu for 419 and Here with mail in rebate the base price will net you around 5 is a nice cpu liquid cooler All of this you could get with buying a different model gpu and it s the same performance as well
The 6ms response time is a killer for me After with having 1ms at 144hz for a year I can t go back to 6ms
If you leave you play safe and dodge easy skill shots Simple Stop making I suck at dodging skill shots into illaoi is op No you just suck at dodging skill shots
I have played against her 10 times now and I have won every time It s just a matter of knowing when to go in on her if she lands an e or to stay in range of it if you know it won t die or to just walk away out of range because you know she will be able to kill it so you might as well avoid the damage That s IF you let her land an e Her e is one of the slowest skill shots in the game
1 the e is one of the slowest skill shots in the game and you deserve to be punished if you let it hit That simple Her tentacles are relatively easy to dodge too You re bad if you can t dodge them that or you picked an immobile champ against her which is a bad idea Just saying stop complaining
Get punished for allowing her to land the slow skill shot
It s a hard skill shot to hit isn t the down time when she misses
20 seconds with the first point in it is very long in my opinionna he is fun to watch tho and when he tilts he plays mozart
You don t need to know what is going on like there are two less people in the game because they re too busy camping the shit out of marin ocasionally you see shen top too that s three less people They could be taking towers doing dragons perhaps barons rift heralds are too risky but the former two definitely should have been done There is nothing that Marin could have done His jungler didn t even bother to give a ward coverage for him which means that he should honestly that s the only excuse be taking things from the rest of the map if he didn t want to counter gank a nidalee fiora which is really understandable really I wouldn t too
Then it could be the problem of what champion you re playing and the conditions you re fighting in For example if you re playing akali versus a riven riven will output an obnoxious amount of damage in the early game while you have to get to 6 to get your thing going Another good example would be someone playing renekton against you and you re as lulu he will mop the floor with your face Can you go to op gg and link your profile then we can see what s happening and help you properly edit another example you re fighting inside an enemy minion wave You ll get destroyed by the minions especially early game
Are your buddies level 30 and have an elo that might be the problem High level players have access to perks that you might don t such as tier 3 runes and a full unlocked mastery tree
and probably the new mastery that you receive mov speed out of combat
Champion gg is pretty good also lolflavor is cool You can try mobafire if your client is still in patch 4 5
holy shit that s some bronze 5 material right here
Yes because going Zhonya s as 3rd item is TOTALLY viable
I used to love pantheon but after they introduced the new bc I just quitted it How do you play build him
Really Cleave them to death if they don t have flash they re pretty much dead even with a tower
Krugs it s more efficient to kill the small one first and the bigger one later Raptors is the same story However if you re getting a leash just kill the big guy first The ohter camps doesn t really matter
but the ad is better early on which games are tending to be most games are pretty much over at 25mins which is when lee sin starts to fall off the game thus I think that the 20 extra AD is better for him than the armor pen
The last sensus showed that only 16 of adults were illiterate functionally illiterate And it was 15 years ago today this number is much lower Also federal institutions such as the Federal University Of Rio De Janeiro and many others offer language courses 100 free if you can prove that you can t pay their high fee of R 300 00 less than 100 bucks for 6 months of course You have also free pre vest courses offered by the same institutions You know wanna put up fake numbers be my guest but don t talk shit you don t know about my country Thank you very much
No you had a bad education yourself because you didn t put as much effort as other people I speak fluent English and three other languages so if you didn t learn proper English either you didn t get into courses or you didn t put enough effort into learning Either way our education is not to blame Also how the fuck did you get to plat buiding devourer rek sai wtf
You should build more FH as udyr It gives more mana to spam stances slows aspd of enemies gives resist and CDR everything you need I think running ghost instead of flash is way better Sometimes you should rethink on going devourer because you ll need to be really tank to make up for your team mates and this alone will be enough to lose the match i e there s a match that you have no tanks at all you should have gone either Devourer and then full tank or opted for cinderhulk one dmg item or none Sometimes you overbuild armor and forget to build MR Also you should consider picking something else other than Udyr Even tho he is a good jungler and you main him having a pocket pick for when udyr is a bad idea i e it doesn t fit your comp or will do bad against the enemy team because they have too much kiting power
http br op gg summoner userName pedrosh0w just for info last few games I was high af and played with friends the unranked ones and I don t play anything other than jungle or support so if you see me in ranked playing top mid or adc I was forced to fill and got rekt
Katarina Leblanc Draven and Zed deleted from the game
Don t worry i can t fucking play aatrox nonetheless
classic
Yes but he is still cancerous 5K hp tons of resist and if he ults he is like lightining fast Also those cleavers deal a ton of damage slows And if when he gets to you that E just deals so much damage
I am only in bronze because of my team mates
Holy fuck this new mundo is just cancer
It s retarded that even in platinum I still see people shouting JINX WHY THE FUCK AREN T YOU ATTACKING VAYNE ARE YOU IN BRONZE GG ELOJOB CONFIRMED While she is protected by a huge frontline That s definitely what I m supposed to doCouldn t avoid this one It did it without my knowledge overnight
None of what you said is true unfortunately Going for trades forces Rumble to go close quarters as his E has an enormous hitbox and cant get around minions very easily and his low level Q damage is so low without the added effect of overheated auto attacks that he loses to almost every meta top laner at the moment As for team fight damage it depends on how mobile the enemy team is Lots of mobility spells blinks dashes tumbles etc make his ult pretty underwhelming especially since teams prioritize those qualities in their carries for the past 2 seasons And once the ult is baited out he becomes a short range low damage squishy target Bad meta for poor Rumble at the moment
I ll be clear I m not losing sleep over this but its as simple as the title I just find it mildly actually moderately annoying is all Especially when I see my lane or champ name being spliced into the words
For some reason I read that Janna Foreplay Coscast Brain pls
In theory but fielding too many players means that building synergy among teammates will be a little more difficult for each extra member C9 for instance they fielded the same 5 guys who knew eachother inside and out for over 120 games Having a whole seperate squad of 5 to interchange with each starter would only hinder that connection IMHO
more likely the latter My thought is unless a support replacement for hai performs better as a teammate and shotcaller than Hai in scrims which is possible Hai will remain on the starting lineup almost certainly
I see what you re saying but from what I understand he doesn t want to step down he has newly inspired passion and his wrists are better than ever All I know and all that anyone knows at this very moment is that Hai is guaranteed a position on the starting lineup and he is ready and more than willing to take that position because he knows that C9 needs him
Except that iirc he is 100 confirmed to be playing next split
Impossible because Hai is 100 confirmed to be playing next split
At this moment somewhere in the World Joe Miller is smiling at his monitor whilst murmering 3 bananas at once kreygasm

I m an ADC main stuck in Gold 4 and my best stat on freelo gg is wards placed Can confirm wards wont solo carry you out of any elo
ELO Hell in a nutshell
Pretty easy one to answer IMHO Due to how the announcement was worded I think that CLG simply wants to restructure the team with new management and an ADC that is less selfish in terms of in game resources AKA real team that doesn t need to rely on him to carry and and instead have a team oriented AD for example Sneaky someone who gives up gold for his teammates and creates strong map plays instead
Scrying Orb Fixed a sneaky bug a SNEAKY bug lol
Bjerg on Dyrus s career Legendary So to say
Rumble 62K
The reason it isnt in place is because it can t be implemented into non LAN scenarios What happens when the competetive level of the game is physically impossible to reach with your ranked 5 team at home
If you re on iOS it seems that if the video is taking more than a few seconds to load this is the fix Refresh the page then wait for the page to load for a couple seconds then hit play Works for me hope it works for you too
The sound of the meme going right over his head
Looks like Mt C9 Thats where our prophet Crumbledore recieived his first revelation
I think that Origen is going to come into week 2 very strong with their momentum and enthusiasm after week 1 They are probably working hard on P B and strategy I feel like CLG will either come out strong or begin to drop games all depending on their preparation Hard to predict an MVP but I m going to go with an ADC Sneaky or Niels Rekkles perhaps Even going 1 2 Rekkles looked solid I could see him coming into W2 with some fury Idk if Jayce can be considered an odd champ pick but seeing as he hasn t been played yet and high damage poke comps are somewhat decent I think some team will pull it out
This is the internet good sir articulation is requiredNow time to release the Tristana skin
Yes please I m only getting that on release then waiting till the Dec 23rd to get some legendaries to get the mystery boxes
I saw these mystery boxes on legendary purchases somewhere but I can t remember where Can you specify or link it pls
http www surrenderat20 net 2015 11 snowdown preview html a little down the page can t wait
I want to buy that syndra skin so bad but i promised myself that i wont spend more money on this game anymore
Im with you in this One day I said fuck it no more money wasted on league
especially after all those ridiculous preseason changes
I havent had in my account a single rp since dj sona so for me its longer than this preseason P
Thank you kind sir
I don t get it can you eli5
I assume the game is going to give you a free mystery skin whenever you get a legendary skin but if you get a legendary skin from the mystery crate you get another one So it is possible you an get rnjesus and get a bunch of free stuff
Yes Buy Legendary Get Box Get another legendary in box get another box So if you re thinking of getting Dragon Trainer Trist on release unless it s on sale try and wait and you can get free skins
What if you get an ultimate skin
Why wouldn t you wait till 23rd to get all of them It isn t that long of a wait especially since you can be busy playing the Poppy update which will probably go live soon
WHERE IS MY TRISTANA SKIN PLEASE
I want my azir skin I don t know why it hasn t been released RITO CMON
Same man
something something summoning the emperor
I CANT WAIT ANY LONGER BASED RIOT PLZ
Time to sell the house
leave it to MYM
It s an old meme but it checks out
Is this active on EUW How would I have known about this if I wasn t a redditor since it s not on the client or the front page of the official site and is buried in page 2 of a specific section of the website
I dont think it is
They didnt forget Canada After reading it put a smile and a tear on my face
Can anyone confirm if the bonus RP works for Amazon codes
Also curious about this
Ill try it this afternoon heading out to walgreens to get a card
Eagerly waiting for your result buddy
I bought a League of Legends 50 Gift Card 7200 Riot Points NA Server Only Online Game Code Sold by Amazon Digital Services Inc where they add the code to your Amazon digital library and it didn t give me the bonus RP I was a bit saddened by this since I missed the other sale waiting for bonus RP
Noooo I wonder if they ll give you bonus RP if you reach out unless Riot doesn t count those as a prepaid card
Yeah I m not sure I haven t bothered to open a support ticket or anything I may do that now I ll keep you posted
ouh time for some early christmas gifts
This is great I can t wait to buy that new Azir skin That s not out yet
Now to wait for the new skins
The Extra RP bonus apparently is not available on LAN LAS why the fuck
So on the EUW site riot only shows Euros and us in the U K don t get it in pounds but on NA Canadian and American dollars are shown Blah blah 25 languages currencies
Whatever the bonus would be for the amount of RP you re buying that s doubled during this event Here s a Euro chart EDIT I did the math on GBP conversion too Here s a table Riot Points 350 800 1760 3700 6550 9500 Non Sale Riot Points 350 750 1580 3250 5725 8250 Euro EUR 2 50 5 00 10 00 20 00 35 00 50 00 Great British Pound GBP 2 25 4 50 9 00 18 00 31 50 45 00
9500 36 if you buy them in euros and are paying in GBP
Thank you for this didn t realise you could change the currency
Depending on your bank you can get charged for currency conversion And it will cost you the same or more than buying in GBP
It would have to cost you over 38 30 in order to be less value than buying in GBP itself 50 nets you 12400 which is 248RP per Going through Paypal I was charged 36 57 for 9500RP which is equiv to 260RP per rounded up
I just wished they would provide it considering there s quite a few of us from the U K and with all Riots talk of localisation you d think it would be necessary Forgive my frustration
Okay I did the math See my above comment for a table

That s really not the point If I can be provided in one place why not the other And if the maths is so simple why wasn t it provided in the first place

Don t know what crawled up your ass and caused you to be so aggressive maybe it s the TSM flair but thanks for your opinion I guess
I dont know what caused you to be so aggressive so heres an aggressive comment back at you
I don t fight guns with flowers
This is what scares me about following my favourite player and supporting TSM this stereotype against their fan base

He isn t a hypocrite You crawled up his ass and caused him to be aggressive whereas you yourself got aggressive for no reason

Europeans complaining about trivial things again What s new
basically a 6 15 for the 9500RP bonus not exactly what one would expect for a big announced sale D anyway have fun
This is the same sale as always It s how they do RP sales Skins sales differ Combine the two for major discounts
Is it live yet in the UK I haven t bought RP in ages and can t remember the normal RP costs so I can t tell if it s bonus RP
It s live it s usually 20 for 4200 but it s 4800 atm
Alright cheers
You sure I was looking way earlier this morning and the prices haven t changed since then
I m certain it started early I checked yesterday to make sure I knew what the original prices were and it was 20 for 4200 checked today and it was 4800
Yea that s exactly why I was unsure I haven t bought RP in a while and didn t know prices I checked this afternoon at 1pm and it was 4800 for 20 so it started well before 5pm
I checked it 8 hours ago and it was active by then
You get 3250 RP if you pay 20 with paypal So add another 475 RP boni Dont know the stats for non euro payments though
That s exactly the problem I m not sure either They say it was meant to go live at 5pm so I d presume so but I looked before 5 and the RP amount for each price hasn t changed in client so I have no idea
This needs stuck on the front page so people won t miss it
Time to oh not wait I don t care Got my Poolparty Renekton already
Dont you like the brutal scorched earth
True Renek has quite some nice skins But the recall animation Cant live without it Also him blowing into his whistle when he ults Still cracks me up even today
This is why that skin is the best
Exactly D This video made me buy it back then lol
This is one of my favorite league videos Only one I can think of right now that tops it is This one with lee sin and Warwick
I ve never noticed Renekton s whistle blowing
It s awesome Always gets me because I imagine him shouting HEY STOP IT RIGHT THERE KIDS OUT OF THE WATER So funny D
One of the best buys ever for me even though it took a while for them to release it Gotta love that recall spamming on enemies corpses
This is me during self mystery gifting two years ago
Time to stock up on RP for the new Trist skin and the december sales
Is this only for NA
All
Any one know if the PROJECT skins will also get an early sale Because the skins that came right before them are getting one in December so maybe right after
The full list is at http na leagueoflegends com en news store sales were changing discounts They re not on the list so no discount in this sale They ve only been out since September so I would expect the 1350s everyone except Yi to be in the next early sale batch with them listing the early sale time frame as 4 6 months after release I m guessing they ll probably do the early sales quarterly Yi won t ever be put on sale again as he s Legendary and they re not offering discounts even the early sale discount for Legendary or Ultimate skins previously released Edit Got the Project skins release time frame slightly wrong it was September 8 so not quite the end of September but still not yet 4 months

They changed that recently in a recent news update so any new 1820 will be discounted at 1350 we just don t know if it will be during its release week or months down the line which in that same news update Riot said that recently released skins will go on sale about 4 6 months sooner than they would have otherwise
Not instead of but in addition to the standard 50 sales For the skins that normally would go on sale that is
When it comes to Extra bonusses Riot really is the most underwhelming I can hardly call this a bonus nor a reason to even buy RP
Wow what an amazing deal ehhh not really
On a somewhat serious note Is this actually all that worth it Obviously if you were going to buy RP anyways its a good deal but the bonuses don t seem very large for someone who wouldn t buy more than 20 tops
It s just small thanks for buying Nothing really worth it at all It s just a small incentive for those were on the fence about it Sales will be soon and bonus RP is to entice ya
Buy now if your going to participate and risk the Snowdown Snowball rewards is how I look at it
What are the rewards risk for snow down snowball
If you buy a legendary skin you ll get a mystery chest to open when you open it if it contains a legendary skin you ll get another mystery chest and so on From December 23 through the end of Snowdown whenever you grab a Legendary skin you ll unlock a free Mystery Box If that Mystery Box contains a Legendary skin you ll get another Mystery Box and if that one is packed with a Legendary well you get the idea We re calling it Legendary Snowball http www surrenderat20 net 2015 11 snowdown preview html
I don t understand why this is being done now and not a week or two before Snowdown hits I m just gonna be sitting on a little more RP for a month
And once again Canadian players get fucked I m pretty sure that this extra RP is LESS RP than we would get otherwise
With how weak your dollar is the rate you re getting is a steal
How so The bonus RP you re getting at each tier is practically equivalent between USD and CAD purchases Also the further our dollar falls the better of a deal we get on CAD RP purchases unless they re adjust pricing again
Hoping our dollar falls for RP gains Wurf
gotta get mother s credit card
Does that apply to paysafecard

Someone should let Riot know that they missed Black Friday
Nice try Rito
Damn what a lackluster sale as always with double bonus RP The only good thing the commerce team did this year was upping the sales from 4 skins from 3 as well as publishing the monthly sales
I just bought RP a few days ago
Can t find this shit listed in only
wow less than 10 bonus rp what a great offer
I m glad I already invested in RP before the CAD sunk
why people even buy rp
really i bought RP two days ago
People said the same thing 1 month ago when they announced it
I activated a card at 10 AM EST thinking the sale had started already Rip me They should have just made it a Black Friday sale
Same me and my roommates all got each other skins this week I wish this had been advertised better
It was advertised 17 days ago
This
Soo On EUNE Second lowest value is 1100 You want to tell me that I only get 50 bonus rp
oh boi oh boi wut comment will make me the biggest shill
Could someone please let me know why it is not available on eune server Are we left out
Oh gooooood 2 days after I buy RP
Riot said they were going to do this more than two weeks ago
Ahhh shet dude I must have missed it
Literally every time I buy RP there is a bonus RP sale like two days later
It was posted a month ago
I just bought 20 yesterday for nunu bot
facepalm are you guys serious do you live under a rock or wtf this was announced like month ago
I knew it was coming I honestly forgot when though LOL
Wow I spent 35 on RP 2 days ago wish I knew beforehand
Actually they announced it about a month ago Must have missed it then
And I bought rp two days ago for a birthday gift
This has been planned for about a month
I posted a psa but w e
Without a link or any specific details included on the actual website
suck my dick and the 4 who downvoted me ur all gayOnes that aren t shit would be a good start
Damn
Haven t laugh at a gif that hard in a while
Dude these players have a family
Insert joke about Svenskeren s mom

When every team you re on doesn t do well the place to start is in the mirror
I would argue that Alliance did very well They re still the only team not named Fnatic to win a split of EU LCS It was just that one game of rampant overconfidence cockiness that we don t talk about that s tarnishing their legacy
Elements is the only team Froggen s ever been on that s ever placed below top 4 in the EU LCS CLG eu was a world class team in season 2 season 3 EG slumped but still made top 4 both splits and was one game away from making worlds Alliance started off terribly in the spring but made top 4 by the end of the split and became the first team to beat Fnatic by the end of the season Froggen s teams haven t always been world class but Elements is the first time he s ever been on a team that could really be considered bad
EU LCS wasn t exactly strong that split Froggen is just a relic of S2 If he had started in the modern era he d be a nobody edit Sorry I m not going to get excited about a guy who hasn t performed since S2
Thank you I needed that Your edit stop please I can t
I don t see what s funny or wrong about what he said It s definitely an argument worth considering
It s not an argument it s a statement An argument usually has something to back it up behind it for example Bjergsen while overwhelmingly dominant in lane and a major contributor to his team s victories is one of the major reasons why TSM looks so powerless against teams who strategize against them due to him needing a lot of jungle attention and wards On the other hand me saying Bjergsen sucks dick and weighs TSM down is a simple statement and nobody in their right mind should take me seriously
THANK YOU Reddit would be a so much better place if people understood the difference
I think it boils down to people being lazy it being generally easier to put down an opinion in a couple of words and that way it often comes off as a factual statement and we all know how people like to dispute facts which in turn leads to arguments
I mean you might be able to take this seriously if you didn t say that he made his teammates worse Where have any of his teammates aside for rekkles gone after his teams The drain nobody wants them because they aren t worth picking up And don t bother using rekkles as an example that s one guy out of 20
Do you ven watch the LCS I guess loulex is an amazing player as H2K is good
I completely agree with you Froggen is by far the most over rated professional player He was a god back in season 2 and people still hold him in those regards
Plz watch league before you make a statement 9 10 elements victories where just plain team carrying by him
Every team CLG EU got 3rd place in the S2 WC and 2nd place in OGN Summer 2012 Alliance won the Spring Split with a 75 win rate against every team wich was at that time the most dominant win rate any EU LCS team ever had
C9 had a higher win rate with 32 2 and 31 3
I meant EU LCS My bad
I don t recall CLG EU being a team that didn t do well
He s a relic of S2 not exactly the modern era It was a very different game back then The only modern era split they did ok in was a very weak EU LCS and then they lost to kaboom He s been mediocre against real competition for 3 years now
Even Season 3 and 4 were different doesn t make Season 2 any different his achievements aren t worth less because stuff changes plus your point about the game being different is different from saying EVERY team he is was on doesn t do well
They did lost to kabum but they also did win a perfect game against a korean team the only western team to do so
How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren t real
but most of his teams did well
Elements is the only LCS team he s ever been on that placed worse than top 4 in the EU LCS
Only that this isn t the case CLG EU were very strong in season 2 and Alliance was very strong in season 4
You are absolutely right about this Dont know why people downvote you Froggen is mechanically gifted but overrated greatly in some aspects
yeah this passive farming play style probably wont workout too well with how fast paced games are going to be next season
You can t seriously be THAT blinded by your fanboyism mate How many teammates has he had replaced over the past few years How many players coaches strategies The only thing that hasn t changed is Froggen as the midlaner and that s obviously where the real problem lies
I don t particularly care about Froggen or Elements but it s not exactly a secret that he s been the best player on his teams ever since CLG EU disbanded
I mean lets be fair here the best teammate he has ever had was rekkles who is like a top 4 adc Europe Whereas you could just spew name after name of bad team mates he has had
Well if we are being fair all those teammates who are terrible were considered super team level players at first Especially when they had success at first But when they started struggling it became none of them were any good at all I think of Niels as comparable right now Most people would argue he is a top 3 EU ADC But if OG had a bad year then I guess we should make him a bottom 5 talent of all time Froggen s biggest issue seems to be in the org itself over players They were notorious of some of the worst drafts last year They would constantly counter pick themselves especially in spring to get late game champs and feed hard so it didn t even matter
Superteam does not mean good players It comes from supergroup in the music scene where people from a few different well known bands get together to make a new one It s more about celebrity and cross fandom than actual talent
Wow you just made me realise how pointless it is to argue with people such as yourself The worst part is you actually believe the crap you write I won t go any further into this discussion because like I said it s pointless
And in his opinion the things you write are crap as well Deal with it try not to be a huge dick while doing so and get off your high horse And while I do agree that Froggen is part of the problem u Mr Annette also has a point
Wouldn t bother arguing with him Guys obviously right you re forgetting how wolf is actually promisq in disguise lol
Disagree with the give Froggen a heavy farm jungler because Shook was very aggressive and early gank orientated Alliance showcased their best form when Shook would roam mid early pre 6 or when Froggen hits 6 and they would get a kill so often because the 2 of them have great mechanics and will win the majority of skirmishes
disagree cause froggen can not win everylane pre 6 or 6 even if he was as good as you think which he is nowhere near now shook is a weak jungler who found himself behind the enemys jungle like 15minutes in every single game
You might ve not looked at alliance wins well then Most of the games snowballed from shook and froggen wrecking mid Shooks agressivnes was the key in those victories And saying Froggen isn t as good as people say is just foolish He s just as good as he always was top 3 midlaner easily
In my opinion it s really hard to call the top three because the EU mid competition is so dang strong Febiven PoE Froggen are what I m assuming you re putting as the top three however Nukeduck Ryu xPeke and Pepi are all very good in their own right I wouldn t say easily but I m definitely not questioning that he is a very good midlaner and very very possibly top three
You are delusional enough said Stats and his play says all it needs to be said
Nice argument mate
rofl
It s the same as always froggens team does well FROGGEN BETTER THAT FAKER LITETALLY when his team is bad FROGGEN BOTTOM 5 MID IN LCS
Right no You got to filter what people say If someone says Froggen better than Faker You ignore that just like I should ve probably ignored you right here and the guy above stating froggen is overrated You might have your opinion of Froggen but you simply cant ignore all the pros that highly rate Froggen And you simply can t be that ignorant to just overlook it all and say froggen is bad overrated past his prime
I have been a fan of froggen for a while now and all this time i have noticed a pattern of people saying he either best player in the west or mediocre I always rated him as a top player which is besides the point Did i phrase my comment wrong to make it sound like it was my opinion
No
Putting froggen in a 1v9 or even 2v8 Situation does make him indeed look bad Tabzz and Him were the life line for alliance When both of them snowballed they were unstoppable Sad thing was nobody was there who could make them snowball at all without getting far behind as team Coordination was also something what could have helped them a brain like Hai is
froggen needs to be on a team where he isnt the only win condition
Froggen and Bjergsen are kinda similar in that way imo
I don t agree to that at all What makes bjergsen so great is that he can just solo win a game I still remember season 3 when he would pick zed and then just split top until he destroyed the nexus Trust me that was neither due to thetess or neegodbro Froggen is way more of teamfighter
I remember one time in summer 2013 when he just solokilled a tank renekton and I think it was deman and Joe miller who were like why is he ulting theres no way he s going to kill that renekton and then pop renekton just dies Or when CW was 0 9 down and then they get bjergsen and he gets a pentakill his first game and they finish the season 13 15
i dont think it was on his first game i cant confirm tho
They were best with extinct and freeze though That team was fucking nasty until extinct retires
Was it CW or NiP
Quite possibly the best team to never actually be
Except every single midlaner in the world coud do that in S3 with Zed Even fucking Regi carried games with him
Froggen needs a AD Hyper Carry a good jungle with early pressure and good teamfighting then just carry him self
Can you parse what you ve written Because the first part doesn t jive with the last part
Like old alliance or old CLG EU you mean so basically exactly what the article says
deleted
That s quite sad but probably right
old alliance needed one good top lanre and it would be so great
Perfect roster for froggen this season hear me out Top Wickd Jungle Snoopeh Mid Froggen ADC Yellowpete Support Krepo
That would be a superteam would love a game between them and a team made of Darien Alex Ich Diamond Genja and Gosu Pepper
i swear like a year ago they had talks to do this but i think Alex or Edward said Genja doesn t really play LoL any more and that why it wouldnt happen
Yet he spams soloqueue
Now yes not back then though
I know Which is weird He probably still plays as much as when he was a pro just soloqueue instead of scrims
Just a heads up they could do that Snoopeh Yellowpete and Krepo can all claim NA residency because they played in NA LCS before on EG when they split Two imports Wickd and Froggen Let s go
CLG EU fan spotted
Wow you got the joke congrats
deleted
r circloljerk is leaking
You don t have to be salty about it
Im willing to condemn froggen to fate this terrible if it means krepo won t cast games
Don t like him
I dont like his casting he s fairly bad and if it was someone else he would be sticking to the desk till he gets good enough
Plus he s fairly bad isn t exactly criticism Counterpoint He s pretty good
He really is Good that is
He s good at stuttering having monotone voice coming out from his nose and repeating the same intonation cycles over and over Aw finally I learned how to not be toxic I turned krepo s terrible casting into bunch of qualities he s best at in the broadcast
deleted
Well that s up for discussion happens often You don t keep it though
Have you heard of the concept of practice I know it must be hard for you to undertand it but it s like you get a sandbox mode where you can try doing all the stuff and hone your skills for when you go into a game you dont actually get to start as CEO of google when you decide you want to try it out He got everything handled to him on a silver platter and he hasnt improved any significant amount since he started If he s actually practicing it doesnt seem to be working for him and he should stick to the desk p s and no practicing his casting outside of broadcasts wont make him spit toxic wastes
I m not convinced by opinion of guy who criticises people by saying they re bad which is criticism of every kid that can t put logic to their dislikes they want to express and recycling overused and often cringy since used without good thought sandbox meme in a topic where it includes audience pressure Practice in closed enviroment won t get you backbone for that I doubt you undertand sry but it sounds funny when I read it a thing since you have enough time to spill so many words to say again that Krepo is bad and show your dislike towards him If anything it just makes you look pathetic
I dont unertand Pleae expain
so kind of like Odoamne Diamondpr0x Froggen Freeze Forg1ven G0dfred A Solid toplaner with a jungler that can both farm up and gank early but is more stable than shook an adc that is strong in the earlygame while not taking excessive risks and G0dfred is the primary shotcaller on giants that play an earlygame centric style that will work very well in the current meta
I dont think diamond is good atm
They need to support his playstyle at least like in old CLG EU
Needs not to pick Ekko
good enough to carry him
I know it s an unpopular opinion but common denominator would dictate that maybe Froggen is the reason Froggen isn t as successful as we all thought he d be I mean how many other people can you blame mediocrity on before you look at the only common thread in all the teams
Statistically Froggen is actually pretty good In Summer 2015 amongst mids he held 1 in Kill Participation with 73 6 1 in Creep Score Differential 10 mins with 4 4 1 in Gold Differential 10 mins with 193 2 3rd in Creep Score per Minute with 9 0 behind Pepi and Febi with 9 4 and 9 1 respectively 2nd in Damage to Champions per Minute with 742 1 in Share of Team s Total Damage to Champs with 37 9 2nd in Share of Team s Total Gold with 27 8 and 2nd in Wards placed per minute with 0 41 Now you do have a point in the fact that he had the 2nd most deaths amongst mid laners in Summer 2015 and his kills and assists aren t up to snuff like the other top mids in the region ranking around 8th 9th While he might not be as fearsome as he was back in the day I still believe he is a force to be reckoned with
Also you have to remember he has those stats when his team is doing HORRIBLE Of course someone like febiven or ryu has high stats but they re on winning teams Froggen manages to do this damage and cs this well on teams that are behind so much
Hypothetically you could also turn this argument around on exactly that It doesn t matter how much gold and xp you pour in Elements s midlane Froggen isn t going to win you the game Gold that isn t being spent towards winning the game might as well be dead gold
Then explain how his DMG min is still second of all midlaners
1v9 died back in season 2 You need a team behind you in order to succeed these days
I don t think I ve sufficiently made my point if you feel that is a strong response Froggen s kill participation and gold share is that high because it is partly inflated by jungler attention and sidelane farm You need to put your team before yourself to succeed these days
I understood your point just fine I m just saying you re wrong
Gold differential 10 due to sidelane farm
Or because of sitting in Lane and not moving his ass ever while his sidelanes are getting dumpstered by tps and roams
How does he then have the second most dmg dealt minute of all midlaners when he never roams or fights and his teammates get dumpstered so hard that the game is over already
Those stats do all look pretty good at first glance but outside of damage to champions per minute and wards placed per minute most of them will be skewed by the fact that he played on a pretty weak team cs and gold differential do point to strong individual performance and imply that he can consistently outplay his lane but he also isn t giving up farm or gold to fight over dragons as much as his competition is
He also has all those stats with a completely shit team around him
Competitive league is moving more and more towards a meta where the team with the best team play wins It no longer matters if you are the best player in the world with the best statistics if you are a bad team player I m not saying that Froggen is a bad team player but it might be the case Maybe the problem actually is Froggen though Take a player like Faker could you see Froggen doing what Faker has been doing What I mean with that is subbing our about half of the games his team plays Personally I think Froggen has too much ego for that I might be wrong though maybe Froggen is a great team player My guess is that he isn t though
Was faker bad in Season 4 SKT played like shit for top korean team so everyone there was bad and Faker just had dead gold
I m in agrrement with you on the fact that the strongest competitive League teams focus on team coordination I just don t want people discrediting Froggen s abilities because his team finished 7th in EU LCS two times in a row Now about your point on his ability to play with a team unfortunately I can t provide any context on that Unless multiple sources come out and say so themselves I ll believe that currently that is not the case
I agree with you I don t know either what team play ability Froggen has He seems to have a lot of ego though which usually doesn t go hand in hand with being a great team player That s all speculation though
You can t say that Froggen is the common denominator when the rest of his team being shit is also a denominator
Cough forgiven cough
You act like Froggen was never succesful he was very succesful with CLG EU 3rd place at worlds season 2 and Alliance was succesful too
And piglet was the world champion in Season 3 Just because a player used to be good doesn t mean they are still as good today
I never said that this article is about what Froggen might need to be succesful again you act like he never had succes and never can have success again You know it was always up and down with him season 2 very succesful season 3 bad season season 4 rough start but succesful at the end season 5 bad season When he had the right fit in his team mates he was succesful and there is at the moment no indication that that can t happen again
The stats from rocky716 show that he s honestly pretty damn good The thing is there are very very few midlaners that play like him His playstyle isn t bad per se but it s different to basically all the other midlaners in the LCS as the article says You can blame his teams failures on that playstyle if you want or on his teammates failure to adapt to said playstyle it s a matter of perspective really Pretty much what I m trying to say is you re assuming that individual player quality is the only thing that contributes to a team s success However it is arguably more important that those players gel well together to form a cohesive plan of action every game It s not the fault of any one player if that doesn t happen
I mean you might be right but it s also worth noting that Elements is the only team he s ever been on that could really be considered bad from an objective standpoint Even during his weaker non Elements splits Season 3 EG and Season 4 Spring his team was always top 4 in the EU LCS That was underperforming by Season 2 CLG eu standards but it s not like those teams were terrible Froggen s only been struggling for the past year and I don t think one bad season is enough to break out the maybe he s the problem argument
watch the games
How can you speak of mediocrity if this was his first really bad season You make it out like he hasnt achieved anything I mean he made the team that was able to snatch a title from Fnatic And its not even like he is on a general decline as he didnt make worlds in S3 and came back strong in S4
tl dr LeBlenk
OH MY GOD this eternal circlejerk i m so sick of it zzzz
Literally put froggen on CLG during worlds with doublelift and thats everything he needs to succeed Strong side lanes and a good supportive jungler
And someone else playing mid Froggen as a sub could have a great team
well easyhoon left SKT
Maybe froggen is a problem
I wouldn t say his gameplay but rather hiw he chooses his teammates
When every team you re on performs poorly is it time to finally look at yourself as a possible issue
Only Elements and EG did poorly Alliance won EU LCS and CLG EU was one of the strongest teams in season 2
Alliance also got knocked out by a wildcard team and wasn t able to qualify over the second seed from NA
On the same note they also schooled Najin White Sword
Since Season 2 he has had one good split ONE That was with alliance obviously and for that particular split I have to admit they were the best western team during the LCS But mate be realistic here for a brief moment and take off your fanboy goggles
No one knew about the Asian teams in Season 2 NA was still NA Europe was the supposed top Region with teams like CLG EU and Moscow 5 and then came the Eastern teams
And CLG EU got 2nd place OGN Semi at worlds
To all the froggen fans out there He has a massive weakness Yes his stats are good but on what cost He is very good at farming and not dying to ganks but he does not pull any pressure or even produce some He never uses his advantage pre 20 mins so its like he doenst have it His team has to deal with a lot of pressure while junglers gank often for froggen like shook did He also hardly ever roams just when he uses TP or follow a roam Thats why his stats are good and his team fails hard If you can set up the right team for him it can work out but so far noone was willing to do so not even Froggen himself and there were a couple of opportunities with a roster swap literally every 4 weeks And if someone thinks he does not need a farm heavy jungler A playmaking jungler will look for fights and mid will roam to the fight Froggen wont follow because he never fights early So the playmaking jungler would just feed Story of Alliance sometimes Shook was good enough to pull it off solo but if he didnt succeed he was donezo Ridicolous expectations from your teammates
That is a really good point I hadn t looked at it that way yet
Sometimes when people are discussing solo queue I see the advice that it s important not just to know how to carry but to know how to get carried and sometimes I think the same thing applies to pro players too A good mid needs to be able to carry but they also need to be able to support their carries in other lanes with Lulu A good too needs to be able to play both tanks and carries A good ADC needs to be able to play Sivir or Ashe A truly great team needs to have players in every lane who are capable not only of carrying but if supporting carries in other lanes Look at SKT1 at worlds Bang Marin and Faker all carried games but they also all played games where they took a step back and let the others carry too And I think that s part of what made them so strong It meant they could adapt extremely well
Hell even wolf has carried games on his Alistair Not as much at world s tho
An aggresive toplaner and either a playmaking support with a cleanup adc or a control peel support with an aggresive adc The jungler just needs to show up at specified power spike times at lanes to get assists
He works well as the second threat in a team CLG eu was at its peak when Wickd could come out ahead in lane and both froggen and wickd would be ahead iirc passive mids need aggressive teammates
he needs to be more aggressive for kills farm objective goals and not playing to wait until he get his gold item spikes
Well at least we know on all his teams that have failed there was at least ONE constant
His fans are deluded if they think he can just hand pick anyone Accept a mid tier team or don t
I feel like froggen is the xpecial of EU Always blames team
imagine if froggen had gotten xPeke s spot in fnatic instead of PoE damn edit not saying PoE is bad
Reading this article made me thought about Forgiven with Froggen I mean I feel like their playstyles would fit pretty well
Froggen with Diamond would be the best combo ever seen on lcs
He needs players that are better than him because he s a has been that literally does nothing but farm and has no impact on the map for 30 minutes
The kind that don t exist
Froggen s biggest enemy is himself
nah
I just hope froggen picks up diamond for his new super team dexter was not the weakest link on EL but diamond could do so much more with good teamates
No offense dude but Diamond just isn t there anymore The skill motivation something is gone Because he looks lost and doesn t know what to do I wish he was good again But he hasn t been good for over a year now And If froggen doesn t figure something out I see him following
lol last season Dexter Diamond
I think froggen should ve gone to UoL with hjarn forgiven maybe Imagine froggen not shot calling with a good top and good support
And no strategy no coach and still too bad of a roster to compete for a spot at worlds If they were in NA they could get top 3 but not in EU really
Febiven hasn t gotten a single solokill in all of LCS Summer Worlds Fail to see how he punish his opponents harder than Froggen does
Yes it might be that he is able to solokill good players sure But if the team or he doesnt make anything from it why bothering mention the solokills
RetardAlert
Not to mention that solo kills rely in 3 factors the winner playing well the loser making a mistake and the champions being played Dunno about summer split but I remember in spring split ppl were getting many solokills with champs like Kassadin Leblanc Cassiopeia Zed Ofc u aren t going to solokill the opponent with fucking Vladimir That doesn t mean Froggen doesn t try to kill his opponents that means he hasn t often played champions that don t easy get a solo kill Hell I remember him being super aggressive and also dying getting stunned under turret while he was trying to solo pepi s Xerath with his Ahri I think who writes these articles uses reddit memes and common places more than actual pro games knowledge
More like facts Froggen has better CS diff at 10 and get more solokills he beats Febiven in lane both games in Summer
good counter point alert
Keep overrating facts m8 froggen alliance for worlds a4
I know it s unpopular but in my opinion Froggen is one of the most overrated players in LoL history He is one of the best laners and has great mechanics but is also a poor decision maker unclutch and weak mentally Origen is a good fit for him but there is at least 4 better european mids than him Febiven PoE Bjergsen and xPeke Ryu Nukeduck and Pepi were also arguably better than him last split Sadly He is sentenced to not succeed ever
actually he won lane vs all 4 of those He lost lane 3 times in summer 1 time to pepinero ssnowballing diana and 2 times to nukeduck by 13 cs at 20 00 He literally won all other lanes
Froggen is great at winning lanes arguably the best at it because of how dominant his cs always is but as a player he has had his priorities in the wrong order since the very start He values minions levels and gold more than the presence a mid laner can exert over the game He takes very few risks so while being a rock for his team to work around said rock doesn t move to where he needs to be and is consistently out rotated by weaker mid laners Obviously his prime was in season 2 on clg eu but this was because the meta favoured such a farm heavy late game playstyle With teams grouping for objectives pushing towers and making plays minutes in advance his predictable playstyle that values the minions of mid lane more than helping bot lane push the tower is more of an obstacle to success than having a strong mid laner I am generalising here he is capable of roaming and does have games where he does appear in the right places but these are too few and far between I would like to see him bring out the success he sees in soloqueue and in some of the older teams but without a substantial change in mindset I don t see it happening
This Froggen won t get anywhere unless he changes how he plays the game There are more important things to do in games than making sure you last hit every minion
Weak mentally yeah he s only been playing competitively for longer than any other player in the West not named Dyrus or Yellowstar Doing that requires strong mentality if he was weak he d have given it up by now
You forgot DL xpeke Soaz etc
Yeah probably a few others too to be honest just wanted to make a point about the length of his career haha
Np i think the same as you but i wanted to point that out
It s unpopular because it s really wrong
Its kinda hard to Forgiven to succeed its so many good midlaners atm He is not good as he once was He is still top 3 western midlaner ever
Yea forgiven will never be the midlaner he once was
i completely agree forgiven couldve been the best mid laner na last split but the rest of his teammates on dig were shit like if they wouldve replaced double lift with xmithie for support they couldve won worlds
Froggiven
Forg1ven mid Wat
kek
Still less dmg per min than Pepii P
I do agree with Ryan in most of the article i also know how for some experts thoorin i guess is one of them froggen is was one of the best LoL players in the west but imo froggen right now have the first generation disease what is this Well LoL have right now 5 competitive seasons the game evolve day by day and the players need to improve learn new things practice more hours etc to be good at the game for those who play since season 1 the work they have to do to stay relevant is pretty hard maybe is even harder for veterans than rookies play the game right now and still be consider a top tier player In the past the game was kinda lineal and somehow easy to follow the midlane was most of time a farm fest with players that breaks cs records and teamfight perfectly khartus ori anivia tf were the common picks and players like froggen xpeke alex were top tier on EU at this time alex ich style was different but he played those seasons Farm be pasive then position well and teamfight mid and late trying to capitalize your gold advantage was the mid lane plan on this The FIRST GENERATION was the best but like i said the game evolves so the players and well korea happens most exactly Faker happens When ppl believe that game style were the best one the game evolve in lane swaps counterjungle dive and some rookie in korea decides to pick Leblanc a pick kinda weak and rare by then because that pseudo idea of lb has no late and utiity against a khartus this rookie doent care for farm even when he beat in farm to khartus in a 2 v1 lane swap he just takes advantage of the scaling time that khartus need and once he get one kill his roam make his rivals surrender at 20 with an scary 11 0 maybe im wrong ln this lb showing that the midlane could be hyperagressive and snowball hard New players apears showing agressive style the mechanics lvl up with champs like lb syndra the poke becomes a thing jayce xerath nid wave clear becomes relevant ziggs ad assasin zed talon splitpush is also a game style for midlanners and you can even be a second supoort lulu soraa mid ori multiple styles and multiple ways to understand the game And once all that happen players of that first generation have to adapt improve or die and many of those legends couldnt do it because is really hard you cant be a top tier player by just playing one style you cant be good by playing just your champs soaz said in his ama how hard was to him understand or acept to play champs that he didnt like and that dont suit to his game style and this is something that players like froggen imo dont understand or have problem adapting is really hard to learn and master new champs even more if you dont like the champ or the mechanichs that it needs is also hard to learn when to be agressive roam splitpush etc and the worst is that the second generation of players can do it faker play every style and thanks to the coach and the korean magic he uderstand every change the game made Froggen yeah you can find many soloque highlights videos but in competitive he just play one style and is like he is the same that played with clg eu so what need froggen to sucess First he have to improve and prove that he can be at par with the new blood and that he understand what the game ask to players right now to consider good ones
Lol Froggen invented veigar and brand in this season and all other shit in the past He s constantly discovering new things Maybe he can t do some styles because his team doesn t let him
Froggen needs tadpoles
Give Froggen the Skt treatment a 3rd hand as jungler a carry toplaner and best adc world and a support with more game knowledge then anyone else on this worldit respawns in under the leaverbuster time

15k Salary now 5 Players on a team 75k 75k Amount riot gives a whole team now 10 Teams in NA LCS for example 750k 750k Amount paid for a whole region 9 Amount of regions excluding NA EU KR CN TR OCE LMS JP LA BR for example 6 75m This is all just salaries for every player in an ideal situation 10 teams a region no substitutes Not to mention production cost to have the LCS of each region and stream it all plus paying all the casters and analysts Riot earns a lot of profit but 6 75m is a big amount of money It s best to leave it this way and have the organizations pay their players rather than have Riot do it
doesn t that mean his bank account would be suffering
FeelsBadMan
Riot pays them that but do you honestly think that the pro players are playing for their teams for free It costs money to have a person play for your team

holy shit i m dumb thank you
Thanks
i have a linux machine at work i could plug the card into but i am reluctant because well it s not mine fans are fine like i said this card has been running perfectly up to now so such a catastrophic failure makes no sense hardware wise if i turn on a game and let it go up to 99C and then quit it cools back down to 60 within a few minutes so the cooling is fine also i just manually looked up all the files modified around the time i installed tomb raider and deleted a few that were left over from the uninstall upon restarting this put me back into the constant heating state starts at 60 and goes up to 96 even while completely idle full driver reinstall using this fixed that but not the original problem
i really don t see the point of credit cards i mean at 22 i have both credit and debit but i basically never use my credit card except for online stuff like it s just an extra step i m gonna have to pay it out of my debit account anyway why bother
hmm i m pretty much in the same boat as him and i don t feel as if i m missing out at all the only movies i enjoy are mindless action james bond mission impossible etc or adventure scifi indiana jones star wars lotr etc and good ones in those genres come out maybe once or twice a year as for tv the only show i still watch is supernatural and that s only cause i m 11 seasons in at this point and it s hard to let go i tried GoT after being bombarded by the hype for years but i read the books first and the show doesn t even compare in quality contrast that with RT which consistently puts out quality content every morning and i don t even know why i d want to watch anything else
man the makeup sex between those two must be incredible
thank fucking god for no 3 hit max hp true dmg bullshit
this is called teleportation
i feel like what they re saying is that they ll keep their site but it will just be another tab on the RT site like fun haus they will be screw attack
i got some kind of chocolate based waffle which was probably a bad idea in retrospect but i was rather in a hurry
Not a sponsor so I haven t seen anything outside the skits but I did go to one of the recordings and that too was meh The only thing I got out of it was that I learned that LA subways are much smoother than other subways I ve been on Also I had a waffle at The Waffle because waffles it was no better than other waffles

ok i ll give you the commute part i live a 5 min walk away from my job so i didn t really consider that but i doubt 1hr is average i d sum up hygiene in one 15 min shower wherein you can also brush your teeth do ppl really shave every day i ll shave like once every two weeks if i m not too lazy exercise family friends all other hobbies are all still free time you re not obligated to do any of those things and as for students i am currently a grad student and was just recently an undergrad i know how much free time we have and it s well as much as you want really so your argument isn t that you don t have the time it s that you d rather do other things with it which is totally fine also and this is to address the idea that the average quality has gone down like the guy below said it s because they ve expanded into so many other areas some of which are probably not targeted at you and even then consider the worst case scenario say they used to make 10 videos week ALL of which were great by your standards now they do 50 week even if you think 40 of those are crap that still leaves you with 10 to watch as much as before
sure they do hell you probably spend at least 2hrs eating and pooping every day even with a fulltime job 8hrs 8hrs of sleep you still have 8hrs of free time and your average rt fan is probably too young to have a fulltime job is still in school college also i just went and added up all the content that i watched on RT AH LP FH over one week and it s actually only 75 min day ofc i do other things as well in fact looking at that 75 i d say that pales in comparison to how much time i spend actually playing games i never said you shouldn t do other things just that the excuse that there s too much of it is a poor one
i ve heard this complaint a lot and i think people are overexaggerating this i watch almost all of their content except for things that really don t interest me like Sportsball or any of the news on The Know why bother when i can just listen to The Patch and get all my gaming news that way or things that i just don t enjoy like Social Disorder i hate cringe based comedy and overall it s only about 2 hours per day less on weekends podcasts don t count because you can just listen to them while doing something else i like playing games like Trials Fusion that don t require audio and then alt tabbing whenever something visual gets referenced and yeah occasionally when i don t have anything else to watch that day i ll scroll back through the list of LPs and rewatch a random one from a few months agoA lot of different teams in different sports have done that celebration over the years

But then when you buy more chips you have too many chips for your dip I m there with you brotherNot entirely but it will keep it in check Dont ADC scale more from gold anyway You will get 100 farm on ur ADC and deny enemy ADC a lot of farm For top and mid pick safe lanes and one of the supports can gank mid The jungler cant really gain more from farming both jungles besides buffs due to respawns on his own jungle and with superior wards we will often see him We gain a lot of team gold from getting towers botlane and in the mid late game an unkillable 5 offensive item ultra farmed ADC will just ravage the enemy team
2 second stealth 3 times is far better than having w evolved W is worth evolving if you are losing super hard or if they have a wait in bush pick comp and you need lots of vision
Mages arent in the best spot Ones who abuse deathfire touch are Brand swain and malz are all not very fun to play against and snowball disgustingly hard

You have to press all the buttons on a target If its a lee sin going 20 0 sure thats a smurf The xin that went 20 14 nah
I dont usually go warrior either tiamat rush but blue smite is extremely valuable Each half of it gives you more XP from monsters
How you do you know they are all smurfs A 10 0 annie could SEEM like a smurf but a pre 30 could easily pull it off
Its the opposite of how it used to be 0 dmg to champs destroys minions
Yeah that one

Meh i think they were warranted although they were put in the wrong place As a TF main myself who got nerfed i d say for no reason clearly no bias in me here ive been spamming her a fair bit and i think her early game damage is pretty goooooood I mean i cant remember a time i lost a trade in lane past level 3 Q plus e does more than half damage and it has insane range I think the e crit should be reduced a little bit early and thats it That way you can actually be traded against

I feel like the skill difference between mid Silver and low Plat is extremely low The same mistakes still apply to this skill level After that it does take a bit of a rise from what i can tell but not to the extremities of the difference between Diamond 5 and 3 That alone is about the same skill difference as mid Silver to high Plat
I think Cutlass into Youmuus is the best start prioritizing Dirk for Youmuus This gives Zed some of the best early dueling power in the game Hexdrinker of course a viable option against AP but i would only build it if they have 2 AP champions or Corki Getting Bork into LW actually seems ok and could be viable in most situations in the current meta Both upgrades are viable depending on the situation Deaths Dance is really cool on Zed as well as Hydra Mercurial Scimitar Black Cleaver and even a crit build with IE and PD Its all personal preference and what works best in the situation

Keeps on skipping back and forth and freezing for me right now Very annoyingI find Chogath extremely boring to play as and against
Pure auto hitting champions like Udyr or Xin Zhao or Warwick
Malphite IMO Can be so stupidly strong but I just can t play since it s so boring
Yorick is so boring that people forget about him
Soraka Nunu Janna Warwick Malphite
Taric Fucking Taric
Anivia Soraka Warwick
Warwick is probably the most boring thing in the game
he s pretty fun in ARAMs at least for me D
Nunu for sure
Playing Nunu is fun TheOddone said as nunu you have to make the enemy jungler as useless than you and it s what make Nunu so funny Playing against a Nunu main is a true horror
Trundle Don t get me wrong I spammed him quite a bit in ranked for a while but his kit is all auto attacks You just click Q click Q The occasional laugh I get out of him is disrupting recalls with his ice pillar
any support that doesnt do damage
Morgana Anyone who thinks Morgana is a fun champion to play and main gives me a headache
honestly i love morgana especially when m doing gamechanging flash ultis or clutch blackshield saves
This my friend swears by Morgana and I don t understand why Everything about her is slow Her Q is a glacier wide but slow as fuck Her E takes forever to do damage and her R is so delayed Her E at the very least is interesting but that is it And you rarely notice her passive even being there
Morgana is a very fun champion to play but my favorite things in this game are waveclear farming and push stance She is kind of like an Anivia with more cc I love Anivia too because she instantly clears and kills all the things
Learn to hit Q you ll see how it s fun to see someone rooted for a year
I hope that s a joke
I love Morgana I have more or less exclusively played her since I started playing league last year almost 2000 games The only fun champion to me I can see why some might find her uninteresting though But to me she s the best
Garen Worst designed champion in the entire game IMO He has a boring and uninteractive kit too high base stats and the W denies lane bullies way too hard He s not even fun to play it s basically play passive before first back reply trades with Q E That s Garen in a nutshell Malphite Same as Garen Onesided impossible to kill forces passive lanes high lack of counterplay if playing melee champion Heimer Forces passive lane and doing nothing but farming for 20 minutes Morgana Same as Donger Stay back stack RoA and W wave after wave zzzz Morg support is legt tho Master Yi Stay back pray to jesus that team doesn t feed before 18 minutes then proceed to faceroll over enemy team with Sated Guinsoo
Hey atleast Garen has a comedic effect attached to him for 1 2 of a game After that he becomes a cancerous version of satan
Definitely biased in regards to match up but I have played against him as Renekton too and have played as him
Only thing that is fun to lane as against Garen is proxy Singed
Morgana is boring Do you have brain
Those insane W W W W W W W W W W W W combos are pretty boring senpai desu
That s the super boring way to play her Her real combo is QWRQW Ignite You use W to harass and farm only until your R is up QW can 100 0 squishies if you re fed and it s honestly one of the most fun things to do running around the map with a 6s 1300 range nuke that can 100 0 half the enemy team
Yeah mid to lategame you can burst down everyone but before that you re garbage To get to that point you need to W waves
Nasus uncontested number 1 Nunu probably second
Ryze garen reksai tryndamere zz
any ADC
Idiot adc champions require very high skill level of mechanic before arguing think of vayne
It s about being boring to play not mechanics Vayne Tristana kalista it doesn t matter I find it tedious and boring as hell And I m entitled to my own opinion
You suck at them so you find them boring ok I see
Alistar Getting him in ARAM makes me want to uninstall the game forever
try going ap with RoA Zonhya rabbadons abyssal scepter and play with snowball
That s probably better however my main problem with Alistar is that I really don t like how he s animated it feels clunky and unrewarding Also IMO his Q W and E abilities are assigned to the wrong keys and I really don t find the champ entertaining enough to take the time to learn
Rammus His abilities are go faster take less damage do aoe damage and taunt Thats like one ability
if CertainlyT designed him this would all be one ability
Taric the most flashy play you could possibly make with him is Flash Stun
Which is why he s next on the list for a Sion Poppy level relaunch
Flash heal save feels much more heroic tho
The key is to only pick Taric if you know mr isn t necessary then stack as much armor as possible and be CDR capped While being literally unkillable you stand there in front of the enemy Zed and spam gems are truly outrageous until they give up
Xin Zhao such a 1 dimensional playstyle only thing that has a little bit of nuance is when to use ult and usually the answer is immediately anyway
I like xin the ult can be tricky of you want to zone people or not and don t forget the aa reset on q p Nah I mean I like xin because i have bad mechanics but a good game awareness so I ll most of the time do well with him Also blowing up the squishies is quite fun when you re fed
Annie lux Xerath Varus Warwick Nocturne MF Zilean Karma my personal opinion anyway
Anivia I don t get how people do it She s so so so so slow
Amumu Anivia Annie Ashe Chogath Evelyn Fiddlesticks Galio Garen Heimerdinger Janna Kayle Malzahar Mordekaiser Morgana Nunu no fun after disco removed Poppy Quinn Rammus Reksai Ryze Sejuani Shyvana Sivir Skarner Sona Soraka Tahm Kench Taric Teemo Trundle Urgot Veigar Velkoz Warwick Yorick Ziggs Zilean Zyra
Yeah Janna is boring too
Udyr He has 4 abilities that buff his auto attacks like this Q do more damage W Steal some HP and get a shield E Run fast and stun someone R Do more damage Also the champion is just fugly as hell without the SGU skin that costs the same as some release games do
Mundo Janna Soraka
Yasuo zed and or rengar
That flair though
This guy gets it
Bard I hate every single pixel of that fat thing Also Udyr feels pretty dumb too
I always get Zilean in ARAM Most boring champ there is Awful toolkit Bard is kinda boring too
You just mentioned my two go to supports D
Wow Kinda harsh Atm he s pretty fun to me and honestly kind of strong past lane phase 45 cdr with stuff like FH and zeke s for mana tankiness makes you the most annoying shit ever Double bombing is also one of the funnest and rewarding things to master Just don t play hom full AP and I guarantee you will actually have fun E spam while spamming laugh is 100 guaranteed tilt for the enemy
Bard is the most troll thing ever Like I don t know how you can t have fun on him
I just wish his passive was different and maybe his W and ult It s mainly his passive that s lame
What s wrong with his passive I feel like it s the most interesting ability in his kit It is a completely unique playstyle and gives him a lot of damage for a support Bard can outtrade most other supports in lane The rest of his kit except maybe his w is also very unique An aow stun that interacts with other units terrain an aow zhonyas and a tunnel for escape engage
All supports are equally boring Afk in a bush for 20 mins and get carried
You don t seem to understand how supporting works You carry the ADC through the first 20 minutes then s he carries the game Alternatively you rush mobi boots and become a 2nd jungler carrying your entire team by ganking lanes by yourself or with your jungler
You are just so stupid support champions are carrying nowaday you have to control vision GANK shot calling Not just stay in bush idiot
also Bm
no
Wat If u do this as a supp you deserve to lose Bot lane is generally reliant on supp to win laneRandom just like at the airport

Out of the whole Rainbow Race Lineup of CLG they choose Darshan
Darker the better
The sweeter the juice
I m the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Why did I cry when Ekko got CC d in the streets when Thornmail made me kill a Lucian fedder than me Hypocrite
now that s a reference I didnt expect in r leagueoflegends
a reference to a little heard album and an underappreciated artist Really hope that dude blows up soon s
we really out here
White teenagers are certainly an underrepresented demographic on r lol
Me too I m kindly surprised
Any Kendrick reference results in an upvote from me
The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry
idk why but this made me laugh D
Cause it s true
Darshannnn on Drugtest Luckily I passed I mean expectedly I passed As long as you don t take any crazy drugs or pop an adderral right before the match you will be fine
Will be fine Ahh classic CLG
At least they arent like an NA csgo team
What happened to the NA csgo team
One of C9 s players came out and said they were high on addy the whole tournament
That s not true It was a former C9 player came out and tweeted about them being hopped on the pills after c9 did very well in a tourney
adderall use abuse is a known issue in csgo and possibly esports as a whole semphis an NA player has even gone on record saying We were all on Adderall
Way of taking a quote out of context he said for one tournament one in which they completely shat the bed anyway
ESL This Darshan guys playing abit too well check if he s on any shit
if any player got positively tested for marijuana would there be any penalties you think
I thought ESL banned the use of both marijuana and adderall when they first created their drug policy
Negative there is no ban on something prescribed Living in california with a doctor who will give you a med marijuana card for a hangnail not hard to get adderall ritalin etc
the fuck gettignt hat shit in Europe is super hard lol
adderall is medication for some people so they can go through their day
guessing it depends where they are if its legal where the event is being held i dont think they would do anything
It means common sense actually They don t care if anyone drinks or not they just don t want anyone playing drunk The same applies for weed it seems
I feel like you would have to be really stupid to attempt to professionally play league drunk or high There s too much money to be earned Football players might fuck up outside of football but I cannot think of a single documented case in the last five years of a football player playing the game fucked up
I would almost guarantee there are players who play stoned somewhat frequently it s not uncommon for heavy users of marijuana to think they are better high There s been documented cases of NBA players smoking before games Lamar odom dropped a few picks in the draft the year he came out because he said he didn t play a game in college sober
Meteos was is a fan of the herb IIRC
He is or at least was There was a post on r trees a couple of years ago where a guy showed off with his grinder signed by Meteos Here it is
I get that I myself have done athletics high as fuck but I would think or at least hope that if there s lots of money on the table people can make the obvious decision But who on earth thinks they can play league better high Maybe if I ve had like half a puff the relaxed nerves would help but by all accounts being high makes me play terrible Terrible as in I don t play ranked if I m high
A lot more people than you d think probably I know more than a few people who basically look at the pick ban loading screen time as time to smoke a bowl before my hands are tied for the next 40 minutes
Smoke up ya dope up
Can t blame them ya know I mean he did too well for his first time on stage
LMFAO Got drug tested after the semi finals
CLG winning must be adderall
ESL said a while back that they were going to be doing drug screenings at all of their events Apparently this was an issue with one of their games
It was an issue in CS GO A former player came out and said him and his whole team had done Adderall during the tournament This team actually happened to be C9s CS GO team It caused a pretty big uproar in the community and so ESL brought in drug testing From what I heard it was a mild issue in the CS GO scene but very few people in LoL had ever done it because the advantage it gave in you a game like LoL is minimal when compared to an FPS like Counter Strike
It looks like they decided to do it across the board I really don t have an issue with it Good for them
Semphis still plays I think he s on Conquest
Yeah he does I think he was retired at the time
But does Adderall really improve performance Afaik there is no clear evidence to that Might as well ban brevages with caffeine
Try playing LoL on Adderall and tell me it doesn t improve performance I feel like I m Faker when I do it
I played LoL while on speed felt like a god fed like red cross It does not matter what you feel what matters is if there is a clear difference between sober and drugged performance
considering adderall is an amphetamine and a stimulant yes it does improve performance significantly that s probably why it makes this person feel like they re playing better because they ARE playing better
People think it makes them so much better because it releases dopamine in the brain
i don t think you know what adderall does lol
I m gonna have to disagree with you there It has helped my performance in many things As with my friends people I know too Not saying all results will be the same but I ve never heard of it hindering performance Link to study
Organisations such as NBA NFL MLB and NCAA did not ban adderall based on some feeling The research and the amount of evidence of its various performance enchanting effects is a complete opposite of lacking or little
As someone with ADHD and a prescription for adderall I can say that it definitely does improve my performance however it makes me tilt like super easily so I don t play league while on it anymore
Well if it actually cures the symptoms of something existing of course it does If you have one arm and there is a medicine growing you another one you ll get better in League I guess That is a super exaggerating example I know but still I still cannot find any source or research of Adderall improving healthy people s gaming performance
i ll take one for the team just give me a bunch of adderall and i ll play whatever game you want
idk man played LoL on mdma won 10 games or so in a row mega fed also zero negative feeligns
Yup same with me and Vyvanse Definitely improves my reaction times and I d say my ability to multitask but also lowers my anger threshhold if that makes sense
yup this is me too i think my mechanics are a little better but gosh darn do I get angry faster my own and ESPECIALLY allied mistakes stand out so much more
No I m pretty sure Semphis even stated that the comms weren t good because of it
some studies say yes and it certainly helps you stay focused and alert over a bo5
I used to snort adderall and boost people in league while I was attending college I was diamond 1 at the time and when I took it I played easily like a challenger player I m talking like 20 game win streaks hard carrying 25 0 every game I had never been able to be that consistent until I tried adderall The drawback to taking it was that is made me very toxic and irritable and it kept me from sleeping enough Some people may have different results but it really did make me play noticeably better
why did you snort it
Crushing it up and snorting it is much more potent than ingesting it orally You can also feel it working instantly when you snort it and the effects usually last much longer I think the bioavailability is something like 25 30 when ingested orally 70 nasal 99 rectal 100 intravenously
Ooh I want me some 99 bioavailability
You play at your peak performance but you don t magically become better Super consistent play may be a better description
Oh yes I haven t played league on adderall but it makes you hyper focused That s what amphetamines do I m not diagnosed or ever really suspected I had adhd
Do you realize that adderall is amphetamine Obvuously it improves performance It lets you focus way better it makes you feel really motivated to do stuff and it slows down exhaustion rate during tasks that would usually maks you tired
The thing that im unsure about is how would they deal with people who actually need adderal or other dexamphetamine medication For example I have ADD I was only diagnosed recently when i went to a paediatrician i m 16 now and in hindsight it would have helped me a lot if I had had a been diagnosed earlier and have a prescription for a drug similar to adderal but has a slightly different chemical structure which lasts longer around 12 hours Being on medication has helped me so much i am actually able to focuss at school now I have also noticed that my newfound ability to actually concerntrate has helped my league play Previously I was not able to utilize my relatively extensive league knowledge that i have amassed over the 3 years that i have been playing Now that i can actually focuss on the game my play has improve exponentially as has my quality of life previously I thought I was just super lazy and wouldnt amount to much I have always been super interested in esports Hypothetically Would I be barred from competing using the drug I have been prescribed in competitions despite having a condition that I been diagnosed with by a professional that can be alleviated by said medication
No you would not All you would need is a doctors note more or less ESL already has a procedure in place for this I believe
Oh cool thanks Glad that they don t screw over people with ADD Reading back over my comment i probably should have condensed it a bit
It gives huge advantages actually lol if used correctly
After seeing Jensens pupils they had to
Is he the only player who got drug tested
eyyyyyyyyy
YouTube Mirror
the gamespot video player is so trash
WHAT S THIS RETIRED BOTS FORCING REDDITORS TO WORK
Corylulu always posts the YouTube mirror
Duhr shuhn
can confirm this is right way to pronounce his name
And for anyone who wants to know it means the act of praying
So you re saying it brings FAITH
Yes you figured out the source of CLG s power
darshan actually may mean one of two things a vision of the divine or b a term for philosophy Can confirm cuz it s an Indian name and I m Indian
Im indian too When you do darshan of a god it means praying to a god For eg Mein Laxmi mata ke darshan karti hoon
can confim im from indiana as well
can confirm im indiana jones
I like this pronunciation
Videos like that should use API transcriptions Durshuhn is actually quite far from it it s just a really bad approximation for anglophones
If you re having an issue with the player please take a screenshot of the problem explain the issue and send that which browser you re using to community gamespot com
Naw Darshan s a cool guy No problem here
cute
Have had issue with the gamespot mediaplayer like a very long time Allways have to watch the interviews etc at YT
Well you can help us fix those issues if you submit a bug report
Haha just did hope you get it working
Thanks
I also am experiencing a problem with gamespot s player there are these annoying ads that always try to play this has been happening for what feels like 6 months now I just band aid the situation and watch a you tube mirror and im sure gamespot would love the page view so if they fix it i will come back
You walked right into it
Yeah he is
or just watch the Youtube mirror
Yup both are options but it does help us if you do both
the shit never works lol
Can you explain why provide a screenshot and shoot that over to community gamespot com so that we can make it work
Always works outside of america just like twitch vods for some reason
For me it has never worked and i m from Belgium The play button doesn t work the video never charge it s like the players is a picture
In Canada not working
In Canada ontario never have a problem
Works for me sometimes this particular video doesn t I m also in Ontario
I ve never had an issue with it personally Guess I m just lucky
Travis when dw cbsi com anonc js is blocked the player fails Emailed as well
I m not sure what that means but if you tell the guys with that email they ll probably know
trackingWithCT js calls anonc js to track the visitor s id and it breaks Honestly if it hasn t been fixed already I don t see it being fixed This took me 30 seconds to figure out
If this really is the case then gamespot tech haven t been working on the issue very hard
I wish I could respond but that s not my forte when it comes to computers
All good just telling you what s actually wrong vs a vague bug report I figure if other people want to fix it on their end they can do it as well and whitelist the offending scripts
It s pushing them to get it fixed They didn t make the player and don t have access to change the code for the player its subcontracted The issue also don t happen on all computers so that s another issue So basically they executives don t seem to care enough to pay to fix it because not enough people are directly complaining to the That s also not the only issue They have a cookie related bug as well that I ve seen
I don t have an issue but I just want to know where you bought the dope socks you were wearing at IEM
Uh I forget which socks I wore there X X I get most of my socks from Trunk Club or Express Anytime someone asks me about Trunk Club I use it as an opportunity to drop a plug for my stylist who is awesome www trunkclub com erin
Thanks for the info I was sitting behind you for a bit and saw your bright multicolored socks and I was like I need a pair of those as well You have definitely been on point fashionwise for the last year or so Keep up the good work though been a fan for years
is this conversation really happening
Socks are serious business
Those are some pricey clothes there o O Definitely not for the typical college student
I don t have Flash installed in Firefox No screenshot needed just move to an HTML5 player
the gamespot player doesn t work with adblock on which is probably what these people are experiencing lol it s quite sad
My issue is that they prevent me from watching their videos while I block their ads But YouTube mirrors make that a non issue
Thank you for finally interviewing Darshan
Is the player supposed to have volume controls Cause there seem to not be any
I can t click either play button Not sure a how screenshot is going to help with that Even if I maximise it I can t click a play button
Can you please send this exact thing to that email address The Gyazo actually really helps And no it should work fine with adblock What you re actually seeing is the player that shows when adblock is on I believe
Using chrome I always have to change the browsers coding setting to western and it works fine
i have a problem with the ads before the video adblock doesn t work on this side
luckily i tested negative lmfao
Darshan on that good kush
Nice video by The Gaff
Great Gaffsby
Luckily
lol drug test because of csgo C9 team were all high on adderall lol
Really
The drugtests at ESL are a respons to an ex Cloud9 CS GO member claiming in an interview that the whole C9 team took addreall at an ESL event to improve their performance
At IEM Katowice
Yep caused esl to react to this whole drug abuse thing like republicans reacting to abortion or just drugs
theres been Adderral for more games than CSGO and you d be very naive not to think atleast a few ppl do it in LoL
Ya but the only reason they started to do it was because there was the whole drama coming out from an ex C9 player saying they were all high on adderall and I m pretty sure it even had newspaper coverage
which ex c9 player of the csgo team came out and admitted
C9 Semphis
A few hahaha
um im not saying that adderral doesnt exist in LoL im pretty sure it does Its just the semphis formaly in c9 blew it out of proportions with an interview he did ESL went stupid mode and banned all use of any form of drugs including MJ and ADHD meds
Well we know that but these event organizers have a particular irritation due to the C9 incident if I m not mistaken it was at a previous IEM
I want to watch this interview but game spot never loads for me so i got to wait now
Can you send a screenshot plus a description of the problem to community gamespot com
I dont know about what the problem that people are referring to but i use chrome and it works good
YouTube Mirror
What are they testing for Would adderall show up in a swab I was under the impression that swab tests were typically for weed Still kind of hilarious though
Adderall would show up as an amphetamine
Almost all Indian people in the States at least have an Amercanized pronunciation of their name they go by Source I have one myself
Really What s the right pronunciation of Pyrofriend then
Steve
It is always him also at the airport
they should test Balls next that guy s on steroids
Luckily I tested Negative O really
Luckily I tested negative Zion on drugs confirmed
I think we played uhh A little less better Darshan
all i hear is darshan darshan darshan darshan darshan darshan
it was only a mouth swab test that ll only catch something within the last 48 hours at most so they just wanted to make sure he wasn t playing the event high lol
pronunciation https youtu be WsMNIA8R1OU t 7
transcription
You have to suck it and spit it all out
They found high traces of cumin turmeric and garam masala in his blood stream
Even his teacher calls him Darshan
Darshan drugtested Quas suspended coincidence
How would drugs make you better at League
Stimulants can improve your focus making tilt less likely and improving split second decision making
I would argue against it preventing tilting although that s also dependent on the stimulant and the person taking it While it has happened to me only rarely I ve witnessed a number of people deal with higher levels of anxiety while on vyvanse or adderall
Adderal in particular has been used as a performance enhancing drug in gaming for a while
Try adderal for pretty much anything and you will know p
It s Daaaarshen
What would they be looking for in the drug test Adderall or Ritalin Also would a player not be allowed to take Ritalin or Adderall if it was prescribed for their ADHD before the game or in the start of the day
In most professional sports you can get an exemption if you ve got a doctor s diagnosis and prescription for whatever drug you need I d be surprised if LoL didn t have that type of rule
I would imagine they do an immunoassay followed by GC MS so they would be able to tell if you ve taken either
So you can t take adderol or other amphetamines in esports
Dur shun
After watching this interview I could totally see why IEM thought he had popped an adderall LOL
whats the actual correct way to pronounce Darshan though
jax with high attackspeed and that ult sound hammering turrets does look like the player is on drugsFaker
SKT Flair
He is overrated I think it is Feb or Bjerg
Lol Bjerg is just not on the same level
in what way is he overrated he s just some off of a near perfect season in one of the most competitive regions then won his second world championship the meta of summer season 5 didn t really suit assasins so while bjerg went on to have an ok summer he did nothing at worlds Faker meanwhile had a statistically outstanding summer split and produced one of the best competitive ryze performances ever seen against at the worlds final
You re gold III in Turkey Your opinion is highly valued for sure
Sorry couldn t play ranked this season Don t have 798 ranked games like you Just played 88 games
febiven ofc he the west best mid laner
Are you being serious right now Faker and Pawn are the best in my opinion bjergsen isnt even the best western mid
PawN is a shitter not even top 5
I like how you are using the fact that he isn t top 5 as a reason to why you think that he is shit So by your standards there are only 5 mids that aren t shit
Bjerg is the best western mid He carries his team every game with having the burden of shot calling on his back too If TSM is smart enough to pick up a shot caller then Bjerg will shine this season Febiven is also really good and number 2 no doubt but I think Bjerg is better Faker rules the mid lane though
pawn have you watched S5 worlds
Pawn lol he s even debatable in top 10
same goes for Bjerg tho
yeah i didnt say otherwise
exactly
good yes best no
I have to say its either Faker or Febiven right now Bjerg is pretty damn good tho oh and btw smart way yo get views on your youtube account lmao
lol no Faker is obviousely the best But Bjergsen is better than Febiven
U really think so i have to say Febiven had a better worlds then the bjergking
Bjergsen had a good performance on TF against LGD Better than any febiven performance at worlds He also played really well with Leblanc against KT Don t forget that Febiven is playing in a way better team than TSM That helps him look good
No it doesn t it actually makes it harder for him to standout If you play in a team full of shitty players of course you will look better but if you play on a team like SKT then even Faker would look mediocre when compared to Marin or Bang Which he did at this Worlds
Faker looked mediocre at worlds because teams focus their whole strategy around him Same as with bjergsen Teams know if they shut down bjerg tsm is done If you shut down febiven huni and rekkles can still carry Febiven benefited from huni rekkles distracting other teams
hrmmm I love Bjerg and all but saying Bjergsen is the best mid laner then showing a video of him killing only people in NA is a terrible idea NA being one of the weakest regions and probably the weakest in terms of mid laners to compete against Bjerg If a Best of Bjerg 2015 movie doesn t have him making a single play against an international team something is wrong
Thats not OP s fault we are still waiting for bjerg to deliver the footage XD
A montage of Bjerg playing bot games Nice
What are you talking about If Bjerg went back top EU he wouldnt even be best mid in the region the only reason he seems so good is because he has no proper competition in NA Froggen is still much better than bjerg Febiven is clearly better than Bjerg Id put my money down saying PePiinero is at least even with bjerg and id believe we will soon see that PowerOfEvil is better than Bjerg too
I think you mean he wouldn t even be top 3 in the region
Well i didn t want to say exactly that but my opinion is that these guys would be his competition and its subject to belief on how he would fare compared to them during a split I can t say honestly that he would not best the majority of them or not but i don t believe he would But he could if u get me lol
How is froggen better than bjerg This isn t season 2 You could argue that Febiven is better than Bjerg but no one else
Why no one else and why does Froggen not compare still did u see his stats last year considering he is playing on a mediocre team at the moment and i dont see why u would overlook pepperiino and PoE
Ayyy lmao
Bjergsen had better laning than faker at IEM katowice and MSI but if its brought up expect mass downvotes His teamfighting is a bit average recently
At MSI he played only stuff like Cho Gath that literally is made to have a strong laning phase At IEM Katowice Faker didn t even play and the strongest midlaner present was Coco
Faker in his prime was playing dade when he was bad and ryu Dont see why that argument matters bjerg stomped maple and coco who are top tier in their regions
Dade was not bad in OGN also Faker trashed everyone in every single international competition he attended
He never trashed bjergsen actually bjerg was slightly better in lane in his prime in s3 he lost lane for the first time to whitezz and nukeduck at worlds despite being untested by Korean midlaners
Top 3 are Faker CoCo Easyhoon between 4 and 7 there are a few people who you can argue for them to switch places
I think I ll go for the guy who won worlds twice But hey what do I know Also nice bait thread I approve
Right now I ll say easyhoon but the meta is changing so who knows
Please wait for the ALLSTARS
but 4 of the the top 5 mids aren t even at allstars lol P
I think Bjergsen can play more champion than Faker In World Championship ss5 Faker only have Ryze
Faker himself said he can play almost any champion perfect and knows all matchups He only had ryze cause no one had answer to it
Have you seen LCK summer 2015 His champion pool is pretty extensive He won while playing Master yi and Irelia mid Faker playing Ryze was part of SKT s strategy It was a top lane meta so most of SKT s resources went to getting Marin fed It s much better for SKT to let Faker to do his own thing while the rest of the team got fed
This summer and worlds Faker won on 13 different champs Bjerg on 7
