Omfg hoe kan ik nou tegenop Dat is 10x beter dan mijn handschrift NIET ZO N ORGINEEL IDEE EN OOK NIET HANDGESCHREVEN MATJES
handgeschreven MATJES let niet op het handschriftSeeing a lot of responses to threads I ve seen on here and team liquid Really great to see That bunker change idea literally came out in the middle of the sandisk invitational cast
It s clear blizzard reads r starcraft
What s the bunker idea I haven t seen the description anywhere
Neosteel becoming an individual upgrade for a bunker rather than a passive upgrade
What s the neo steel passive upgrade I play Zerg sorry never heard
It just bumps the bunker capacity from 4 to 6 Almost no one gets it though It s too costly and pushes other upgrades from the engineering bay back for too long to be worth it
Has this always been in the game I ve never seen anyone use it to my knowledge and I ve been playing sc2 at a high diamond masters level since WoL launch This is sad to me if that s the case
Yeah it s almost completely unheard of Especially in the higher skill bracket And what s worse is that there is no possible way that you have seen it and just didn t notice on account of the obvious remodel the bunker gets
Bunker have 2 extra slots for units to get it 2 more marines or 1 more marauder and a normal cc and pf have 5 more slots for workers to jump in
Fix for the Tank issue Introduce an upgrade with Armory requirement that lowers the siege time to 1 5 seconds That way one of the coolest additions of LotV stays in the game and it restores the importance of positioning in TvT because even if unsieged the better positioned player will get the first volley off Also it would make the Tank more viable vT P and potentially serve as an alternative to Liberators
I like it a late game upgrade that stops the early harass maintains tank lines most of the game and allows for an upgrade that shifts the game later
Maybe helps v ultras lategame
That s a very huge maybe The ultras would still close distance and when they do you would need to hot pickup the tanks stim your army kite the ultras backward and reposition the tanks and wait out the 2 second delay before they re allowed to fire again I still don t see tanks being a viable solution unless some more fundamental changes are made regarding cost supply etc
Ya I can agree with that sentiment I only suggested it because tanks are so rarely used in the matchup now unless in the early game Mech just can t keep up with Zerg
yup and mech falls victim to the whole one big push wonder and when it fails the game is probably over
Tanks are not good versus ultras
I think it is still a good idea for the tanks to drop unseiged which makes the current type of play less viable IE pushing with medivac marine and dropping the tanks when you get close The Bastetrade TVT tournament was pretty much entirely that one tactic
It s amazing but it also takes a shitload of attention and micro It has one of the biggest downsides which is I can t do much else while I do this Still I think players rely on it as a crutch if it is effective propping up their harass despite not being better than their opponents I d much rather the tanks unseiged when they came out
yeah i see nothing wrong with pickup of a sieged tank this is really good change in some ways Dropping it in a presieged state does create that odd interaction about mobile mech and bio they point out
You need to realize that the terran who s spending all that time microing that siege tank drop is gonna be banking up minerals gas It is not a totally costless thing to do Also you re aware the drop was nerfed The siege tank isn t allowed to fire for 2 seconds after being dropped Stephano kinda had that problem solved even during the beta right click the group of lings on the dropshop so the tank can never land Focus your queens on the dropship Tank drops kinda suck vs zerg Tank drops to be honest have fallen out of vogue these days It s not seen in TvT anywhere near where it was during beta and even if it is an old school marine hellion drop does far more damage It s just sad when a tank drop is countered by a single viking and we Terrans all know this so we just kinda stopped doing tank drops
I like this I would go even further and just say we should just lower the siege time requirement in general to make them more viable in all matchups and retain positioning benefits Then maybe force them to unsiege when picked up by a medivac The reason for the across the board buff in my eyes is that mech being a viable composition requires that the tank be the bread and butter of the army and right now I m just not sure that is possible
nah I think they shuold keep the siege time being able to rescue tank with medivac is enough of buff in mobility department Instead they should make the tank itself stronger when sieged I mean whole point of siege tank is to have firepower in exchange of total mobility Right now it has neither
If you want TvT mech vs mech only then this is a great change
That s the case in Brood War and it s fucking incredible
Guess what LotV isn t Brood War
This is awesome feedback I m glad they aren t addressing the balance whine yet and are focusing on issues that they perceive as design issues that s exactly the correct mindset to have in the offseason after a new expansion was released Good job Blizzard As for the feedback itself I do think TvT would be more interesting if tanks unsiege on load because right now we don t get to see positional tank lines at all they re basically being used like Reavers in Shuttles If there was at least a soft incentiev to not pick up your tanks then you d have to actually think about where you siege up
Also you could pick up two tanks at once
That s some good positive feedback Thumbs up Blizzard
They should allow people to submit coop maps to be played Kind of like Super Mario Maker P
What was the bunker upgrade thing again
Neosteel frame Currently you can invest some cash in the engineering bay The problem is that Ebays should be used for upgrades on priority That makes the other upgrades have to wait until 3 3 is done which essentially makes them useless The suggestion Players were saying that the upgrade should require certain tech like engineering bay but then the bunker itself can be upgraded to have neosteel plating for an individual cost It might affect bunker rushes in the early game but it will certainly help terran hold a third base against rava roach timings as well as some of protoss shenanigans EDIT I should probably mention that neosteel frame allows 2 extra spaces on the bunker That means 3 marauders or 6 marines It s a pretty nice upgrade but committing 100gas and 110 sec not sure in lotv time to get the upgrade AND delay your upgrades Just isn t worth it in its current form If its like a 25 25 upgrade on an individual bunker it would probably worth it
Sounds like a pretty good change
It does sound like it would help terrans hold against early ravager pushes although the meta should start shifting towards opening with tanks instead of liberator But I m also worried about the impact it will have on bunker rushes
bunker rushes are already much weaker compared to hots and if you need to upgrade the bunker and have an ebay it would be very hard to use it so eary in the game
Tanks vs roach ravager isn t good at all Tanks aren t that great vs roach until you hit crit number although it is great at softening them up but usually you have 1 maybe 2 tanks by time roach ravager timing hits Ravager is non armored and doesnt take bonus from tanks The answer for ravager timings are banshees not tanks Tanks are sitting ducks vs ravagers and simply isn t powerful enough
Oh man Here we go again with the bunker changes
I m down for another wild ride I think watching zergs defend proxy rax is my favorite cheese
Hellow everybody i wanted to give my opinion concerning mech tvt drop tank I think that mech is really bad right now for two reason The first one is that lotv is obviously way more dynamic when it comes to expanding as a mech player you always need alot of turret and a big army around 170 pop to secure a 4th base quite safely on lotv the timing of the 4th is way earlier than this supply cap this reason is already a big buff to bio play for the whole game when it will come to expand even more bio will have the advantage obviously but for air transition it will be also be a big deal right The second one is that in the past you had to scout well and adapt to the mech air army making tech lab to kill the ground with banshee or some reactor to take back heavily air control with viking since lotv you just have to make some reactor and you will be able to kill mech army ground air with viking liberator and just finish the game if your opponent have a big air army since the start he wont be able to expand and take control of the game So drop tank in my opinion almost doesn t affect bio vs mech at all your idea that it helps escaping from big fight with your tank is not realistic everytime you fight as mech vs bio tank u ll have the viking advantage and will kill every medic that will try to come close to the fight Concerning tvt bio vs bio it gives a really weird dynamic but i dont have an opinion yet concerning that maybe it s giving good game maybe not we will see Bunker upgrade great idea finally take care of not giving us something too strong Balance overall doesnt look bad especially with this really weird and probably bad map pool most pro think that zerg is too good vs protoss Co op missions are awesome i really think you should give us really hardcore brutal missions and a way bigger range of mission anyway 15 20 to start maybe Give us skin
Revert the siege tank to greatness http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Siege Tank Heart of the Swarm Patch Changes increase life from 150 to 160 if overkill is implemented siege mode damage changed from 35 15 armoured to 60 70 if overkill is implemented siege mode upgrade damage changed from 3 2 armoured to 4 5 if overkill is implemented attack cooldown increased from 2 8 to 3 0 i e takes longer note these are old Blizzard time seconds unsieges upon medivac pickup If a nerf is necessary first look into increasing the attack cooldown Reducing life can come second but keep its high damage A strong siege tank is awesome and makes it a unique unit
The Starbow design is like that as well pick up a sieged tank and it unloads in tank mode It doesn t allow for any really fanciful siege tank kiting but as everyone has already said fanciful good especially in combination with the medivac It might be more prudent to remove something so powerful which makes the siege tank so well rounded and removes its main weakness
And make the unit nearly worthless in every other matchup I hope they will not do that And if they do I d like to see them at least having 7 range in tank mode or something
How will it make it worthless in every other match up
Tanks will only be used in TvT In HotS we would see an occasional TvZ mech game where tanks were used but even those are disappearing Mech is weaker than it s ever been
Wasn t every zerg and his mother bitching about mech TvZ at the end of HotS
For a month or two then it got sort of figured out Majority of the late GSL SSL games and Blizzcon games were bio Plus in LotV mech isn t as good because they nerfed ravens added ebola cloud ravagers and the economy makes turtle play much worse I don t think the best terran mech army can even beat viper broodlord corruptor Maybe with ghosts
ebola cloud
Parasitic bomb that aoe air to air spell
good source please do not discuss on that level It is quite obvious that in the current state of LotV tanks will be obsolete in any mid to lategame Especially without tankivac micro Not to even speak about tvp Everyone who knows anything about the game knows tanks suck dick in LotV even more than ever adepts carriers tempests major warpprism buffs even disruptors and the more spread out economy it should be quite obvious
I mean everyone was complaining about it because Korean terrans were destroying everyone with it for a while Your source of it s quite obvious isn t all that much better
Sorry but this is just not true I guess it isa typical case of selective perception which happens quite often here on reddit Yes there were a lot of games for a small time period in late hots were some players won with kinda disgusting mech style games But Just look at the wcs grand finals every tvz was won by zerg Life Innovation Hydra Dream and Rogue Maru And yes everyone went for some mech
Maybe but forum whiners aren t exactly the wisest about balance If mech was as strong as some said we would ve seen it far more often in pro games The pros use whatever gives them the greatest chance if victory which in TvZ happens to be bio
Pros were destroying every one with it too
What does destroying everyone mean statistically If it wasn t a higher win percentage than bio then it s meaningless
It s not even really used in TvT anymore I m not seeing it anywhere near the level it was during beta A single viking is all that s required to counter the early tank harass kinda sad and all the more so that the sieged tank isn t allowed to fire for 2 seconds upon landing
Well I dont know about you but I am using tanks quite regularly in the other matchups right now And I probably still would if I could pick them up sieged to drop unsieged behind my army to save them
Yeah I use them in every matchup too
You ok you might use them but i saw no tanks in any lotv tournament And if there were some they were always used with medivacs If you know mech pro games please link me
I do not know if I like this change design wise but in tvp and tvz this will decrease the tank use even more Mech gets weaker and weaker Viper Ultra Broodlord adrenaline glance adepts carriers spread out Economy disruptor faster creepspread all these changes are horrible for mech while mech only got the tankivac and the cyclone as buffs for mech and the tankivac now might fall So why would anyone do anything else than bio sad times for terran imo
It would also make XvT a lot more fun too I m all for this change
Yea it s kind of a joke right now almost feel like an open game server where retarded sht is allowed
You mean identical to HotS TvT Yay edit It is hilarious to see terrans happy with this change Idiots edit 2 mech players build vikings
Siege Tanks just need a straight up damage boost The solution to the units problems seem to avoid making it better at its main role which is to park somewhere and say to the opponent come at me bro
Fully agree for comparison the ravager corrosive bile does 60 splash damage Let s think about that Compare the ravager against the siege tank which does 35 light 50 armored damage It just highlights how horribly bad the unit is
I don t really understand how stronger siege tanks lead to stronger bio in the situation he mentioned But then again I m a scrub
Mobility via medvacs makes the tank way way more mobile and sustains the firepower of tanks which is what makes mech strong iiiin the first place Bio simply out does mech in its current form
Bio in this case is marines medivacs and tanks as opposed to mech which is primarily factory starport units Because you are building medivacs for healing your marines anyway and you aren t making as many tanks as a mech player a lot of the time you can pick up all your tanks in siege mode Your army is only as fast as its slowest unit If you can pick up all your tanks then your army is only as slow as your marines Meanwhile mech still has to siege and unsiege the old fashioned way Even if they use some medivacs to carry their tanks they never have enough for all of them Before mech was slow but it had the power of siege tanks Now mech is still slow but bio also has the power of siege tanks
Oh okay then its just an issue of naming that confused me I guess I was still in HOTS thinking where bio was the 4M and including tanks made it bio mech
Bunker change hype
co op missions should be like Greater Rifts get harder and harder forever Higher and higher levels would force a transition to tier 3 units I can beat brutal co op by massing 3 3 zealot dragoon OK it taught me how to macro success Teach me how to transition now Before you know it a good do op player is now ready for 1v1 D
So it begins Patch 6 version 0 8 0 14593 Build time decreased from 40 seconds to 30 seconds Patch 16 version 0 19 0 15976 Bunker build time increased from 30 to 40 Patch 17 version 0 20 0 16036 Bunker build time decreased from 40 seconds to 30 seconds Patch 1 1 0 Build time increased from 30 to 35 Patch 1 3 0 Build time increased from 35 to 40 Patch 1 3 3 Salvage resource return reduced from 100 to 75 Patch 3 0 X Bunker upgrade change
I thought Adepts were declared the new Bunkers during the beta
Reddit where references take the place of humor
I need to say that all points mentioned in update are very much in line with what our community was saying for some time already Cool to see that Blizz is listening I was hoping for more details about Z nerf and or P buff as that seems to be something that needs more focus Anyway very good Comm Feed
I mean its understandable to not bring up balance issues immediately before the first major tourney
It s also a feedback update not a balance patch yet
about the burrow issue why not give the players the OPTION TO CHOOSE and since they seem to be fixing smaller issues now how about fixing one thing morphing a mothershipcore which is not at full HP into a mothership results in a mothership that does not have full HP Sometimes you need to kill your own mothershipcore before morphing it into a mothership because of this stupid thing Even a 1hp corrupter will result in a full hp broodlord
As you say it s a small issue but I think you re probably right
F2 will no longer select Disruptor shots SC2 a game for casuls confirmed s
just for protoss
I for one am proud I didn t know that was an issue
Glad they are pointing out who the target audience of Co op missions are I think a good way to make them harder while still encouraging casual players to play them is by increasing difficulty gaps between Normal Hard and Brutal with a game speed increase above Normal This way it s still easier on Normal but Brutal will be closer to the campaign level of difficulty Also make sure to do the balance test map for the burrow changes the number of users who try it shows the level of interest in the change
Just make a difficulty level above Brutal No reason to mess with what s there already
The more difficulties you add the worse it will get better to change what you have than add more and more and more tiers
That doesn t make sense Adding a new difficulty does not make it worse it just adds another level of difficulty for people who are finding brutal too easy
Then why don t they do it for Campaign If you look at Blizzard s history they just alter the difficulty of each existing one rather than add new ones It s easier more intuitive and helps people not learn new things constantly
What This makes no sense at all People learn how to play it on X difficulty so instead of making a new difficulty you will make then relearn how to play on a previous difficulty and say it s more intuitive I don t think you know what that word means There is really no precedent for this as there has been no co op based missions Adding a new difficulty is simpler then readjusting all the other ones You know that the current ones are working so just make a new one and bump up the difficulty That way people who just want to play on normal don t suddenly get an undesired difficulty spike
I don t understand why for some reason the people here don t seem to understand or care that co op mode is meant to cater to all audiences and not just to the 1337 GM level that these guys all seem to imply that they are I am fully in favor of Extreme mode which I understand already exists in the game but is currently locked away I would like to see more maps for sure and a Raid boss mode which poses a new level of challenge which all but requires both players to use maxed out heroes to stand a chance of a beating
Then you haven t been around long enough to see how Blizzard balanced difficulty between expansions which is fine I ll stick with history though over non intuitive ideas
What I ve been around since warcraft 1 There is no history here You re talking about an expansion pack being harder than the original game That was fine for campaign when the expansion pack required the original game Such as Frozen throne BW and Beyond Dark Portal They were all harder than Vanilla because there was an assumption that people had already gotten used to the races by playing through the original game and thus no Make a barracks and train 5 footmen missions were needed This is something completely different The intuitive thing would be just to add an extra difficulty or two to co op because 1 This is a stand alone so you can t operate under the assumption that people know all 3 races and 2 People who are just playing for fun might not like their normal difficulty suddenly getting harder Look up the word intuitive because you are not using it correctly
Many of my friends find Normal too easy and Hard too hard increasing the difficulty between Normal and Hard would just exacerbate the problem
The worse what will get Plenty of games do this without issue Add a Legendary mode or something
I am excited for the future of coop I would loved to see like themed mission DLC like Broowar Missions or like character themed Was talking to a friend about this and we both agreed Like we love just sitting back and relaxing and chatting as we do coop and it s good fun Also would love a balance post Parasitic Bomb is gross lurkers are gross and zerg seems super strong Parasitic Bomb is so strong that it basically doesn t make you split it makes you avoid it or you lose your air army Very frustrating
What do you mean it doesn t make you split You should always be worried about clumping your air army together ZvT It s just one more thing to worry about
I mean as a Protoss sorry Like splitting Pheonix doesn t help they just die anyways it seems So much single target DPS too
Phoenix counter vipers pretty hard as they are light armor Even if you trade in a couple of phoenixes vipers are so expensive it s probably favorable Just like zerg have to be careful of thor liberator destroying mutas you have to keep an eye out and try not to clump your air army
Vipers aren t light they re armoured
Oops my bad Phoenix still kills them pretty fast though
I m pretty sure 3 Pheonix will die to a bomb before they kill a single viper with micro
How is the stalker blink on dusk towers a bug I thought that was intentional considering it makes so much sense Really sad they re removing it
F2 no longer selecting disruptor shots is a big plus in my book
Sounds like we managed to make Davie proud Good job Screddit
while we are at the f2 discussion I think we should be allowed to decide what f2 actually selects
I can t believe they want to nerf the siege tank to make mech viable lol Maybe in TvT but seriously did they completely give up on mech in tvp and tvz Do this change but please buff the tank in some way pleas Viper Ultra Broodlord adrenaline glance adepts carriers spread out Economy disruptor faster creepspread all these changes are horrible for mech while mech only got the tankivac and the cyclone as buffs for mech and the tankivac now might fall
Give siege tank in siege mode priority to attack massive vs massive attack bonus after upgrade unlocked by fusion core
Would the individual bunker upgrade remove the ability for command centers to store additional workers When you get neosteel frame the amount of SCVs that a CC can load increases as well I actually use this sometimes if I m expanding to an island so that I can load up 10 15 SCVs into the CC right away Also how would salvage work with this
Parasitic bomb needs to be nerfed The closest comparison to this spell is Irradiate from brood war Irradiate did not stack and had to be researched Science vessel were more expensive than vipers and it did not have consume to rapidly gain energy Despite this it was still an extremely strong ability pretty much shutting down muta play the moment its researched Whats even crazier is that brood war didn t have smart casting while sc2 does The graphical indicator on parasitic bomb need to be clearer as well Its very difficult compared to irradiate to tell with unit the spell is on
Blizzard you are simply amazing
Still nothing about potential nerfs to Liberator and Lurkers
Not even a mention of the balance issues is a bad move imo Seriously they need to nut up and just say they are holding off on balance changes for the moment if that is their position It feels way worse to have no recognition that balance is likely out of whack and they just need more data to make their changes
if tank pickup is changed to have them un siege then there s basically no reason to pick them up unless you want to save them from being killed That change would destroy more or less any offensive drop play
I believe the tank pick up was designed to save them not offensive play So this should not bother them
On the other hand sieged tanks are almost essential to defend ravager roach early pushes If tanks are no longer sieged after dropped by medivac it may become more difficult for T to defend Still I think that could be fixed by doing something to ravagers which would benefit all match ups
It will definitely become more difficult to defend Lifting tanks in siege was the only way to easily dodge corrosive bile shots I don t think they should get rid of tank lift but they should definitely make a viable way for terran to dodge bile shots with tanks
bear in mind that if the tank is unsieged upon pick up well there you go The ravager has basically accomplished its mission because now you have to drop the tank again siege it back up and meanwhile you re still under fire I would like them to leave the tank drop thing alone It s been already nerfed tanks can t fire for 2 seconds upon being dropped
you can still harrass with the proposed siege tank Tank drops will happen still but you don t sacrifice the tank in the way you used to in hots
Yep it just makes it a bit safer I actually like tank drops but this isn t a bad solution since you can still harass with tanks and other units but now you can save the tanks while still maintaining positioning micro
well hang on we never sacrificed tanks or even want to If you lose all your tanks in a push guess what The push is effectively over Those tanks had better get decent value for their cost supply or what good are they
The 2 medivac bio with 2 some tanks drop that saw some play in hots was sacrificing at least 1 tank to get some damage done This is a form of harrass one that Blizz wanted to strengthen All the proposition changes is that you can get a tank out and harrass more effectively because the tank lives longer and can be re dropped
You re gonna have to show me some replays because HotS was not about the tank It was about the widow mine and the 4M push
I never said it happened often but it happened occasionally as something different to do on ladder Blizz strengthened it as an option and even with this change it s still viable That s all I said
I agree It s more about hot pickup from the start And this change may bring back more positional plays while allowing more micro opportunities to save them in unfavorable positions
for the love of god david please do something about zerg
Still no word about ravagers they need their armored tag back Invulnerable nydus needs a fix too
What s the point of these posts if they don t mention legitimate balance concerns Nothing about liberators lurkers ultras photon overcharge It was pretty great when Blizzard was iterating so quickly on balance in beta and now when the balance actually matters they take a nap
Or it could be that what you think needs changing they don t Most of things you list don t seem to be a problem for balance
Blizzard addressed all of these things in the last feedback post except ultras so they clearly know that these are balance issues It s just super confusing that they are waiting to make any changes or even SUGGEST changes
Because at most the game has been out a month You have to realize that DK and his crew have to sort through pages and pages of posts full of absolutely useless complaints That s why the beg the community to post constructively and realistically If you go off the handle spewing bullshit about how this is broken and that is broken it doesn t give them an opportunity to see the actual good posts that legitimately explain the problem or post evidence of it Moreover blizzard monitors win rates extensively They analyze the shit out of games to find out what is actually fucking up the matchup and what isn t I think the reason SH and Infestor BL lasted so long is because the choice to nerf the unit would have been completely counter to what their design was in the first place Maybe in hte future if we learn to actually post constructively instead of flaming blizzard we will get a faster response My guess is that the units you mention are in the game to force players into playing differently In the past we had no reason to spread air units besides mutas against the thor wm Now every race has to do it People will adjust and figure out how to deal with pbomb Give the players time to innovate At least they are trying instead of just bitching about it online
Ok that s all great but this is the one outlet that the balance team has to communicate with the fanbase and it feels odd that they don t discuss the issues that a lot of people are complaining about If only to say we don t think unit is imbalanced and here is why And I get that the game has only been out for a month but during the beta there were balance patches on a weekly basis Then the game releases and they just stop The same people were complaining about the same things when beta was still going on and they weren t addressed then and haven t been addressed since the game has gone live Also what about something like chronoboost where David Kim has said several times that he doesn t think the design of it is that good and will need to be changed No mention of what might change about chronoboost since the current iteration was put in place other than dkim saying it s not a great design I love the community interaction but it feels really half assed
Most recently David mentioned chrono at the blizzcon panel I think it was during the Q A session it was very clear he wasn t really pleased with the way chronoboost currently works and that it will likely change Also I think you are missing my point I m not saying that blizzard should balance the game every week like they were in the beta It s more like these problems mostly with Zerg have been present for the last few months and haven t been balanced in the beta or otherwise and have hardly even been discussed
How do you objectively know it s a problem though are you gauging this based on watching streams or looking at ladder rankings Have we had official win rates disclosed yet Currently Korean GM ladder has zerg at 35 of the population 32 32 for T and P On U S it s something a lot higher but that has to do with the fact that NA generally has higher zerg population
There s lot of problems but I ll just focus on the Ultra in TvZ Yes they are harsh powerful But I think Blizzard doesn t want us to stick to bio all game long anymore We have to try different solutions such as liberators which do fantastic vs Ultralisks only problem is if the zerg decides not to engage of course Then there s the new ghost drone thing which I ve yet to see anyone else including myself It sounds like you really must be cloaked to use it otherwise don t bother trying My own miscellanous thoughts I really do not like what they did to Raven Auto Turrets They were incredibly nerfed only 7 second timer wow What can you even accomplish with that They really really didn t want us to be able to do the whole mass raven thing anymore so they killed it Siege tanks need to relook at regarding their cost 150 125 3 supply unit which is inferior to the ravager in nearly every respect
they probably have ideas but choose not to share them since dreamhack is tomorrow Declaring specific things OP right before hand will hurt the tourney hype and why make statements like that then the best test of current balance is about to happen For all anyone knows parting will rip out some insane pvz build and rocks the tourney Idk There is just very little to gain by saying something right now
The point of this is not only balance issues I would question the point of these if it only was balance issues as blizzard stated in their past 2 feedback updates which you clearly forgot about balance is not a primary concern as it is too soon to judge
What s the issue with lurkers The very rare times they ve been made in the recent online tourneys they didn t do that much I do think that Ultras could lose one armor and the cast range on the Ravager bile should be reduced though Sucks that they make tanks so bad in TvZ
I m not sure those are really the main balance issues at the moment
What are the main balance issues then He only forgot ravagers in my book
I think the community perceives Pbomb libs ultras lurkers disruptors tanks zerg macro roach rava nydus and mech being bad as the primary concerns for balance I think blizzard perceives The PvZ matchup as the only problem that needs some help They didn t say they would nerf zerg or buff protoss but they want to help the matchup which means there s probably skewed from 50 50 win rates Lastly a lot of the community complaints are phrased pretty much like a tantrum People lose on ladder because they missed their splits and then run to the forums to make a statement in hopes that blizz fixes it instead of going back to the game and practicing airunit splits These posts dilute all of the good ones If idiots stopped mouthing off and thought constructively Blizz might be more open to discussing balance I m glad they do not pander to those that seek fixes from Blizzard especially at this point in the meta Ultras in my opinion are only a problem against bio terran I think protoss struggle a bit but immortals will always be a way to deal I think lings kinda destroy immortals tho so there might be need of something a bit stonger in hte air like a buff to voids but it s probably low priority compared to the zerg macro problem I think that if terran finds a way to defend against zergs early game then mech will find its way back into the matchup and ultras will become easier to deal with Libs with range are currently pretty decent against them Ghosts are okay but need to have maybe more than 1 hit before disrupting snipe Maybe like 2 3 The only change I can see for Pbomb is to make it non lethal That s the only way to allow it to continue to function in LOTV because if it doesn t zerg will surely get fucked in the air In my opinion everything else is fine Nydus is a huge complaint but I m pretty sure it is only that Libs are awesome fun and interesting in every matchup Disruptors just the same Roach rava is really strong but people will find a way
Early game is where Terran is strong against Zerg Ultras on their own are possible to just about deal with if you spot them coming and already have a good immortal count But it s Adrenal glands lings that are the issue with Hive tech Zerg vs Protoss 40 attack speed is too much of a buff 3 3 3 Zealots in a choke point get rekt by 3 3 adrenal glands lings cost for cost it s not even close Along with the brood lord issues which require colossi still even though they are god awful and invalidate disruptors in a big way The main issue with PvZ is that each thing Zerg can do got buffed considerably Roach ravager Hydra is a lot better than roach hydra Add in Lurkers to the mix and you need a huge commitment to Disruptors to deal with it at all Commiting to disruptors means you have very little AA s can t deal with the muta remax at all Z has so many different things that require an entirely different solution from Protoss It simply isn t possible to keep up with tech switches anymore due to the limitations of chronoboost and the new economy Liberators are an issue with TvP it s a lot harder to work around them than it should be and once they get range they can leapfrog and barely need any marines at all If you can t see that then I m not sure there s any point having a discussion with you
I would be totally fine if the ghost snipe resembled something like Nova s Triple Tap from Heroes of the Storm The zerg player hears the zzzzssttt sound effect hurriedly hits his hotkey to check his ultras and quickly moves the marked one out of range It has to be channeled it emits a very obvious warning sound effect and it paints the target Lots of counterplay right Right now I don t know how useful the drone thing is especially when all it takes is a single ling attack to disrupt it
They got rid of the drone the ghost ability looks like Nova s triple tap New ability Steady Targeting Deals 170 damage to a biological unit after channeling for 2 seconds Channeling is interrupted if the Ghost is takes damage or loses sight of its target Costs 50 energy There s a line like the widowmine so you can see which ultra is about to be hit There s no reason for a global warning because you shouldn t leave ultras or indeed your army unattended for any length of time that s the case with all the races
There is always going to be balance whining everyone thinks their race is underpowered in some way The only clear issue at the moment is zvp which they mentioned 5 days ago
You can t say he didn t cover the major balance issues when that s precisely what he did ZvP is a problem because of ravagers lurkers and less so ultras Liberators aren t really a balance issue TvZ but they are TvP in either matchup they make little sense design wise and it s pretty boring watching liberators leapfrog across the map
I d really like to know if they ve had a chance to read the great post on having an inject counter https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3u2qdy queuing inject larvae is great but can we please With over 500 up votes I hope they at least take a look at it
I honestly think they are about a week behind whenever they give these updates Whatever research they gather from community sites they probably pool it in a report and send it to higher management a la DK DK then processes it under his criteria and the types up one of these fine feedbacks for us to relish On the actual topic they may get to it in following weeks I think it would be a really nice Quality of life upgrade but at the same time I think there are other things in the priority list
Next week should be good as they will have tons of data from dreamhack
I really hope we get some good stuff from DH
i dont see how the tank drops are a problem they are fucking awesome to see why would you get rid of that let the meta find itself Ive already seen people going mass liberator mech and that is cool
Pack your toys Terrans we are supposed to deal with Roach Ravager and Nydus with Hellions I guess Also yay for deleting the only new gameplay change for Terrans in LotV
you should try making liberators they are a pretty good new unit terran got in lotvAs level 1 Cool will check out when I get out of this train thx
Well for some missions you need to be insanely cost efficient in brutal as level 1 So you need to know every wave and plan everything ahead of time And even then I d doubt it Would love to see a vod to admire the skill
Or just go mass wraith My level is too low for brutal but hard is ridiculously easy It would be cool to have a difficulty inbetween hard and brutal
Well what I mean is that ghosts can theoretically be quick and extremely cost efficient against ultras
Check out the Shoutcraft vods I wish they shared replays Personally I m playing a reactive style with shitty unoptimized builds so I can learn how the game works first
Theoretically ghosts are the best Snipe 2 shots the oversized beetles So you make 15 ghosts Now you need to 1 Deploy tanks 2 Pre split marines 3 Line up snipes 4 Not fuck anything up while your friendly neighbour is pretty much a moving On the beta I lost a game where I was 60 supply ahead because I messed up the army control Like I said it s like lategame tvp was in HotS So yeah I d say 15 or so libs with lots of marauders Don t know if you can get a good offensive engagement in a scenario where you re were behind initially though The switch sounds good but your production isn t as quick as the Zerg s production This post sounds very salty but I think tvz isn t a hard matchup simply because you can kill a zerg before lategame since your economy is better than in hots and Zerg hass less larvae to work with
Don t know how many barracks worth of reapers you mean For 2 rax proxied I m pretty sure it s holdable by pulling 4ish scvs to cover your marines until your factory is up It s fine to lose scvs your opponent will have no eco or tech After that follow it up with a marine hellion elevator and it s gg
I think it s situational if you feel like you ve got momentum and want to drop more do small trades for small trades medis are great because they make you units more cost efficient constantly then you should be making medis On the other hand imo if you lack momentum or you re not ahead it s better to go for libs after 3 4 medis so you will be stronger in big engagements Once the Protoss has a stable 4 base economy you should always be making libs so your army stays competitive
Fair enough Do you play on NA or EU
Master terran was masters in hots and on the lotv beta havent played enough to be masters in lotv Tvt Contrary to popular opinion I found it to be a lot of fun you re completely stretched on your multitasking ability doing all the usual macro stuff while constantly placing new spotters moving your army tactically etc Players with sick mechanics will be rewarded I like that The matchup seems like a ton of fun to me the randomness can be circumvented a bit by proper spotting and scouting and reacting quickly Tvp dunno have only played 2 protoss in my 20 games on the non beta edition so far Tvz I don t use libs as much as I should but don t really need them considering I m still chilling in plat Zerg has some nasty builds now but aside from that it seems like an easy matchup as long as you kill them before they get to ultras with a proper economy edit were you pastabrain on the lotv beta I think i had you on my friends list was named Bob on the beta
Holy crap 76 games already you ve been going HAM
Three people in my clan are masters already Just need 25 games to be promoted If you re an average master league player you won t get there in 25 games considering the calibre of players in plat dia though This is EU but see no reason why it would be different for NA
I think he completely misses the point haha
I wasn t talking about selecting buildings
Yeah I mean he s like methodical and efficient
Why no location hotkeys Why no shift queues to prevent idle scvs after they re done building
Nice took me a while to read but it was very worth it
This is pathetic man just leave him be put him on your ignore list This is like bullying a little kid
i ve tried unbinding it but now i just click it habitually i wish you could disable it
No they don t any calls on imbalance are purely anecdotal Blizzard know more but they re not transparent with their data
wow you weren t kidding
okay cool thanksGood Events like this are good for the health of the game and community They should raise the level cap though or offer additional portraits for like 1500 2000 wins especially for those of us who have been playing the last 5 years
This is very cool I love seeing those numbers
Too bad XP is completely and utterly useless for anything other than unlocking a few silly vanity portraits
You d be surprised what people care about One of the major Overwatch complains is a lack of progression or long term goals But yeah it s dumb
Maybe because in overwatch there is no goals outside of the game I mean they are no suprasegmental achievements goals whatsoever The problem with overwatch is that you are learning literally nothing for playing nothing can drop from you at the end of the match you don t get those virtual points currency and in the game you can t see your stats played it during Rtb2015 much better experience although point system is flawed in a way it was implemented before closed Beta there were some stupid ass multipliers for team kills yo ucould go on a 10 solo kill spree as an assassin adn you would be almost last on the scoreboard whereas a support sticking with the other guys together would be 1st 2nd very easily
I ve been playing OW non stop since Beta came out I d prefer it not have long term goals I think they re pointless and adding grinding into a game to unlock any gameplay affecting element of the game would absolutely kill it for me
Keep XP turned on It s a great tool to ensure you really did finish off that cloaked or burrowed unit
I feel like Co Op must have been designed with this in mind since even beating a mission on Hard with bonus objectives wont get you an upgrade later on This should make the grind actually bearable Though they desperately need to add more than 5 maps The boost for race levels will help casuals For hardcore people that already play all the time they are probably maxed I feel like they need some other form of progression for hardcore folks Probably something involving the Tournaments since I don t think trophies are that big a deal to keep people signing up long term with how frequent they are
Why not tournaments every hour as the normal thing They should make it so that you get more points during this week or during tournaments to encourage play
well you want tournaments spread out enough to ensure good matchmaking Increasing tournament frequency when their is more player activity works fine though
They would lose their value It s ok right now
I would propose more rarity Every 6 hours 4 times a day That leaves enough time for every time zone and work schedule to have access to at least one tournament each day You lost try again tomorrow puts a bit more emphasis on playing your best than you lost you get 3 more tries tonight If you want to play more than that that s what Ranked and Unranked is for isn t it
Why would they lose their value It d still be the same difficulty to win
So I ll ask you Would you watch IEM or DreamHack if it would be every week
Automated tournaments are not the same if I could enter a tournament every hour I would have a lot more freedom but the getting to play more wouldn t be bad if I could play tournaments only I would I don t see a reason to play ladder instead of tournaments unless you really need the time efficiency But I am Silver noob so take that as you wish
There is a middleground the developer should reach in order to match popularity for sure By making tournaments every 2 hours they are still accessible to everyone while they are rare enough that the game feature will still be interesting 6 months from now Shoving a tournament down our throat every hour is a perfect way to make them a boring gimmick down the road Blizzard did it perfectly by testing this out for a week long event a very rational choice IMO
I ve been out of the loop for a little while How many levels are there now per race in Lotv

Not as far I know 50hrs was just a guess
Still feeling it 4 days after finishing the campaign epilogue
Open to interpretation I myself prefer the happily ever after theory simply because we didn t wait 5 years to find out Jim drinks himself dead out of depression Kerrigan is a god dam Xel Naga it s hardly far fetched that she survived and was able to return Plus they both deserved something good after all the crap Sarah Jim went thru
Brought both so far enjoying both games but without being biased I have enjoyed LOTV more to the tune of 50hrs as opposed to FO4 at 11hrs
Yes a few things off the top of my head the lower the mileage the better PVC system health any clunks when turning at low speed usually is a good indication of suspension wear 4c struts are not cheap auto transmissions had a valve body problem on the early examples 03 05 model years worn clutch the fly wheel is dual mass and most shops won t touch it which means 800USD for a replacement cruise control operation if it doesn t work the clutch master cylinder is likely weeping requiring a replacement plus a new clutch position sensor 400USD for both Best thing to do with a potential purchase would be to have the car hooked up to VIDA aka Volvo dealer software as it will give a fairly decent outlook on the cars health Maintenance is key with the R if the previous owner was slack then you will pay for it This is sadly the case with my car however in my country I didn t have a better option as very few R s are on the roads here let alone manual ones

Is he retiring I know he was considering it earlier this year to move back to Korea and retire around this time P
He could be going into military service as well
i love requesting shitty music on his stream

I can t imagine trying to concentrate on playing SC2 while listening to those tunes
for money who gives a fuck
I m pretty sure he s got virtual audio cables installed so he doesn t have to listen to that shit
Pretty sure he does listen to it judging by wincing on some of the tracks visually
lol wtf why Poor Forgg
You know there s a word for what you do Sadism
i m actually quite submissive in bed
take it boy
which way are you trying to get me to roll
the dungeon master way
let me get my socks
May God rest ForGG s and your soul

mostly BMS but yeah a lot of this trash is on osu that s actually the main reason i quit people called this garbage J pop and legit enjoyed it i got so sick of it i left
Hey the second video is actually decent until halfway through though
This is you
Beautiful You re doing God s work
Interesting move Either personal reasons he is leaving Millenium and or he knows something about new WCS season we don t yet
He s going back because he has do to compulsory military service sometime next year
I hope they give him a position that takes advantage of his experience Like walling off the border harassing enemy command centers and setting up tank formations
gonna need someone else to make sure the wall is up though
wait you have to do military service in korea even if you re not even living inside korea o
If you are an able bodied male korean citizen you must do military service eventually If you move out of the country to avoid it you likely have to be ok with never going back as you will risk legal issues when you step foot back in Korea
Yeah I went to grad school with a guy who was from the US had dual citizenship and gave up his Korean citizenship so he wouldn t have to go back and serve
thats pretty crazy
Or you are a member of an important Chaebol clan I cant see the boys of the samsung ceo play in the mud
This made me wonder how players like Polt have put off military for so long According to liquipedia Polt is 27 Another would be Bomber who is nearly 30 iirc While Forgg for reference is only 25
Bomber is the same age as Polt I believe but yeah its weird they can go so long I assume for Polt its because he is studying in America but I m not sure why Bomber doesn t have to go
Polt will probably end up doing KATUSA which is where you do service for US army in Korea because you can speak good English It s more chill and you go home on weekends
Woah TIL Thanks for the info as a Polt fan I am pleased to hear he has that option
Polt completed his study two years ago if what I ve been told is correct
Bomber is also 27 not quite nearly 30
maybe harder region locking
If ForGG can t pass this harder region locking its 100 region locking since he Polt and viOLet are the epitome of players who live long term in their regions
deleted
I think you re a bit mistaken my friend Polt has lived a majority of his life in America for the past three years His primary residence is in Georgia and prior to that he was studying at the University of Texas He s lived here full time longer than any other Korean pro
deleted
Such as whom He has an American girlfriend lives in an American home eats in American restaurants and plays on the NA ladder The fact that he ll even ladder on NA is good for the scene What exactly do you expect him to contribute He s a serious progamer he s not going to show up to local LANs which I don t think there even are any in Atlanta He streams regularly He s nice to people and accessible to fans What more do you fucking want him to contribute Besides the folks at Basetrade folks like Lowko Feardragon and other similar people sorry for leaving many people out there aren t a whole lot of people contributing in a very public and open way People who play the game are friendly try their best and entertain sure contribute a heck of a lot more than most do I m not even personally a fan of Polt s but you re being ridiculous against him for no reason and you obviously don t have any facts to back up what you re saying
Not really he spend the first three months of 2015 in Korea thanks to Desrow for that info but has lived full time in US since He took a 4 day vacation to Korea before WCS and we know that from his streaming schedule
deleted
What StarDust doesn t play SC2 anymore he retired and like ForGG and viOLet he s lived in his respective country for years now Hydra has been here a year and if he stays as expected he obviously will be seen in the same light Polt along with ForGG and viOLet are the epitome of foreign Koreans ForGG will leave that group and Hydra will join it Just don t make stuff up about him living in the US for most of the year
Stardust lived in Europe somewhere for 2014 and moved to NA this year before retiring a long time spent in the foreign scene JD spent as long in the US as Polt this year and you re not giving him any credit at all Polt gets so much love for being Captain America because he waved a flag despite not knowing what it even meant or symbolised his words not mine
I think it s because the Korean government is fussy about them living outside Korea when they get to a certain age they don t like renewing passports and visas when you ve not done army duty yet Hopefully he keeps on playing it ll be a shame to lose him
sure hes a good guy and all but his country needs him to do the military service not such a shame imo hes had his time in bw and such i could think of 10 players it would actually be a shame to lose right now forgg not one of them
The only reason I think it d be a shame to lose anyone is sentimental attachment I like ForGG I enjoy watching him play so I think it d be a shame if he has to do army service now and would rather see him as a pro for longer My 10 would be Flash JD ForGG sOs Maru Inno SortOf MorroW Rogue and Keen sOs Maru and Inno are the only ones there who would have an impact on the game if they were to stop playing maybe Flash but I don t know how much of a draw in Korea he is now but it doesn t stop me from thinking it would be a shame to lose the others
yeah man i can understand that a lot i also love all the old school sc2 pros TOP Mvp Genius Squirtle leenock im kinda sad the current sc2 scene isnt what it used to be but thats just normal i guess people move on and times change just 2011 was a great time for me i ve always loved Keen too i saw him streaming a month ago or so and he has crazy mechanics im glad hes still around at least if only supernova could join sbenu aswell guess im just venting now
That s pretty surprizing
army maybe
I m guessing this might have something to do with it https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3itzj4 forgg to retire in october or november
Hopefully he will play GSL
Depends on what you mean He still has the chance to play at Blizzcon but he wont be playing against people in WCS America He will be playing in the GSLs and SSLs in order to get the chance to play at Blizzcon
I should write WCS Premier League Thx for fix
i think this is a good thing a majority of koreans that leave the country do it because they can t compete with fellow koreans and their skill starts to lower forgg has fallen in between being better than pretty much every foreigner but being a bit lower than most korean players hopefully moving back reverses this
Problem is Koreans start going to NA now
oh my goodness if this means we have a proper region lock in WCS I m gonna weep tears of joy Blizzard Entertainment s esports division saving esports EDIT Or it could just mean Millennium canned him for intentionally team killing during that one set of qualifiers this year
Yeah the ForGG rule just made another loophole for players like Hydra to exploit I say good riddance
What loophole Pro players are mostly fine with players moving to other regions playing on their ladders and contributing to their scene and winning What they re not okay with is them just flying over just for matches and dominating because they live in the region with the best available practice they want there to be an ecosystem
Army soon Boys No offense but ForGG has been playing for a long time and I don t see him achieving high level KR play anymore

Excellent negativity you have there m8The article was alright but Rob Zacny is a super good guy so it s nice to see him covering SC2 a bit
I wanted to share it with you folks because I really liked seeing SC2 s pro scene being covered in more mainstream game journalism
Yeah thanks Stopped reading PCG in the past year or so because I feel like it s really went down the drain in terms of quality but Zacny is the best strategy writer around Three Moves Ahead is a sick podcast and I love him on GWJ too
Wonder why he two sections on terran kekekekek

No cool down on cancel is stupid people will abuse it
If you have a cancel button you need to put a cool down other wise everyone will just shoot non stop until you get a good one and not cancel that one But half the cool down could make sense tho
Wasn t gameon the thing that catz created and that casted the enders game on bluray invitational
its not about money given its about being disappointed of not getting something you were so hyped for like if you are suppose to go on an epic vacation but get sick and cant go its nobody s fault but it still sucks Also i have been complaining to jakatak but its just because he is the face of it and they give him nothing to give us
well we have seen trailers for starnation 3 years ago and we still got nothing saying they are working on it doesn t mean shit these days

All 3 parts are standalone you do not need any of the others to play You buy wol to get the Terran campaign heart of the swarm for the zero campaign and legacy of the void for the Protoss one Other than that the multilayer on legacy has more features so if you want to get the game for multiplayer I suggest lotv You can play with your friends as long as they have the starter edition which is free
The only way is to turn the graphics down but even then they will still be there just uglier
He has litteraly dozens of dollars
I think it s safe to say that overall he s been the best Armada as always been a solid contender but mango when he turns it on he turns it on
Nope you don t need the other 2 legacy is standalone go have fun

Your need to contact me for a pointless comment tops it I do believe
Know nothing about What is there to know about a hillbilly wanting to feel big and powerful over a creature who isn t able to fight back You re more of an animal than them If only you could be put into their situation and have a blood thirsty beast like yourself hunting them down in cold blood You deserve bad luck to follow you around Perhaps your foul offspring will get to attached to preying on animals and taking lives and turn on other people as foul as you You might see some error in your ways then Typical Americans I spit on you Here s to hoping for you to experience their pain and fear one day God bless that you scum bag
Oh wow I didn t think about this Thanks mate it crossed my mind as to how I would know if they re upgrading and how far they ve already done Appreciate this
Think you re getting confused here pal Integral92 is his channel name and in game name that i saw gl finding whoever you re looking for
Aw yeah that ll be useful Thanks man So many minor adjustments can have a huge impact
Dunno if that s his name or what Integral was his twitch channel name I ve seen him online around 2am London time but as he s living down under who knows what his schedule might be Good luck man
It has absolutely no impact at all Your words not mine x
Tab does allow you to cycle through the units so you can use the compilation of hot keyed abilities Think it s pretty reasonable to assume it worked in conjunction with alt grouping But hey I m wrong Now people will see this as well and know now to rely on that false tip My bad But tab does do something so we re both wrong in one way or another
No it s a guy called integral92 Plays Zerg and makes an effort to give viewers tips and whatever questions I ask
It cycles through the separate units If it doesn t allow you to split them into groups like that and only use the units abilities then correct me if I m wrong so I can delete that bit of the comment I only just found out about the alt grouping hot key from this post so I assumed it worked with it If not ignore that bit P

That s what I thought Nothing you could think of that would defend your actions Hi I m an inbred red neck My Hobbies and interests include killing defenceless animals without giving them a chance in hell and raising my also inbred red neck children to do the same thing Ahyuk yuk Hopefully a tragic hunting accident befalls you and then you might realise not to be such a cunt when there s a bullet lodged in your innards Merry fucking Christmas you piece of filth
Also pressing tab whilst selecting multiple units all let you cycle through the different types of units to quickly set this up and or use the abilities of the units
Well amidst the chaos in the next episode I m sure he ll show his hand
Plot twist Like Did you not think he was going to come and do something malicious at some point If there s one thing the writers of this show are and that s unsubtle They ve shoved it into our face since the start of the season whilst believing they have us fooled Same goes for Glenn s story
I d never heard of those words before I moved to Springfield
And you realise you go around putting a hole in an animals body ending its life without a fighting chance Coward And your children will most likely grow up like you Disgusting
Ah a self confessed hunter You are a disgusting human being There is nothing doesn t about you at all and you should be ashamed of yourself I d spit in your face if I were with you in person Nothing more than a psychotic child that wants to feel like they have power when in reality you re just a bully with a gun Let s hope you befall some sort of hunting accident so that other more important lives may continue Go fuck yourself you gun toting redneck
It s just how the story ended was funny in a odd way I m with you on that I love playing Zerg The looks how you get your army out The building animations All of it Pi m still pissed because the user not in your realm bug has existed for five years and with the new way friends lists work i can t check the profiles of people or people sending a friend request to remove the realm bug on someone s profile you would add them as a friend now you can t do that lol
deleted
to avoid sniping you have to accept a friend request for them to appear online so you can t add them to your friends list to get past the realm bug anymore assuming they have no idea who you are and choose not to accept
You get friend requests O
You don t Try to remove some of your current friends that have been offline for a long while when you are at 200 friends you can no longer receive or send new friend requests that might fix your problem

Yeah I was envious of the CS GO instant replays this weekend then this event came on and I was glad to see a comparable broadcast feature I will stay on the old windows for now though
So is it the Ro16 tomorrow and the rest during blizzcon Is there anything occurring on the weekdays
the soccer ball deflection was beautiful
This is a very special image haha
Back in my day we had fast food lunches and then we played in a field so none of us became fat Bring something with fibre so you can poop fine and then eat the other two meals of the day at home
Triggers 100My pleasure
No problem I also find it really helpful when you need to split up your army when you get dropped in multiple locations Or when you want to set up a flank
Do you just teleport to your enemies when using VATS with melee This looks weird without actually seeing your character move to the targets
Reminds me of Wolverine vs Thanos
Thanks for all the replies guys It s pretty late and i just got home so will read them tomorrow morning
I would save around 40 42 but lose 400MHz Do you think there would be a noticable drop in performance Because if there is i would rather pay the extra 40 42 and have a slightly better system edit I wanted to but i didn t because i couldn t find all my components there I have to get to work in 15 minutes but i will make a pcpartpicker link once i m back home
Thanks for the fast reply It s still downloading but i will have fun once it is finished definitely D glgl for you too
If it isn t gone in 3 days i would definitely see a doctor
LotV servers are down
Is this Don Cheadle
Thank you i hardly use the cube only to get passives from legendarys Do you mean upgrade rare to legendary I ll try that I think i have a few hundred death breath already
Yes i m playing the lvl 22 greater rift now i think it s the equivalent of T5
I think i have all the gems then because i haven t had a gem drop in a long time I really want to play right now but today is reserved for my girl Shame she doesn t play or we could clear rifts together A man can dream D Thanks again
Do you mean gems instead of rings I find more legendary sets when i do normal rifts but i thought greater rifts would drop more But thanks for the fast reply
I don t play LotV yet but i noticed something like this since after the 3 0 patch I feel like sometimes i have to wait a little bit to give another command For example when i want to build 2 extractors at once sometimes only 1 drone builds an extractor even though i m pretty sure i gave 2 commands i m not using shift click to build i give 2 seperate orders This never happened to me before the new patch
Alright thank you edit I just tested it and it worked Thanks again
Thank you I wanted to start a new season char
This may be a stupid question but could i do bounties on T1 and collect all the caches and then switch to T10 and open the caches so they will drop T10 items Is there a difference between T1 and T10 items
I m lvl 70 now and now i see the keyssweeeeet a game thats actually worth following
EffOrt vs July hype
Clearly I m well out of the loop July went back to BW I thought he retired or was doing his military service
He finished his military service and is playing Brood War again https www youtube com watch v Pivxx3A1efUI watched Crank and MMA yesterday and a little of Crank and True today I ve got to say Crank is one of the best streamers out there Hes so funny polite high energy and interacts with his chat really well in English He even translates for his audience which I thought was terrific Definitely looking forward to his next archon games next week
I was watching the other night and he was randomly choosing people from chat to dictate what strategy he would play in the next game Saw some hilarious stuff he was clearly having a good time and chat was loving it My favourite Korean streamer for sure
Hah my friend and I played our first ever archon game this afternoon and got matched up against Crank and True It went as well as could be expected
Sick guysHoly shit gratz How long did that take
Well done I really need to play this mode
and portraits are still low qualityhaha thank you
Hey don t thank me thank Jaedong
Its just a single build worth a try Not saying it is the only way to play
Np It is such a good build I have 80 wr with it right now and the cool part is that you can choose to back off and you will be ahead or just be even with your opponent
Yup I am aware Last ones have gotten at least 30 views so Apparently there some people out there entertained simply by the gameplay And in all honestly the gameplay is pretty beautiful allied commander does a great job of creating some great eye candy moments
Thanks for the feedback will for sure make a change with the audio software
Thanks for the feedback Will try to work on that in the future
Hey my first video ever will definitely fix the chair squeaking and also will use my own footage in the future
Yup there is for sure For instance against 3CC when you kill every SCV and they stop you with a banshee all you need to do is do 7 queen roach with nydus follow up auto win anything else is giving them more of a chance to get back into the game imo
Even as a zerg that was simply great play from SoS hats off to him
And this is why I didn t include Lilbow in the strawpoll for who will win Blizzcon didn t even prep for Blizzcon lol
And this is why I didn t include Lilbow in the strawpoll for who will win WCS

ME too its been so much fun
This update is so confusing to me
0 0Now this is a repost I haven t seen in a while I ll let it slide
Everyone who upvotes this is an idiot
Yes I am an idiot
If you truly were an idiot would you realize it
lol it sez anal def aliv gaem
this is bad even for a shit post
SO FUNNY FULLKEK IM ALSO 11 YO
Eh I laughed
you must be 11 then
He s actually 7 but very mature for his age
thank you my mom is very proud of me
Silly I know but it made me laughBeen pretty much watching state 24 7 since he got back into streaming He does as lot of replay releases it seems Probably one of my favorite streamers atm
If this is legit and approved by State it s incredible How did you get these If this hasn t been approved by State I would remove it asap fingers crossed State s cool with it Edit It s legit Hallelujah
State posted it on twitter
Thanks
Awesome thanks for posting and thanks to State I ve been struggling vs Zerg real bad lately
So I went through all the PvZ reps already and starting to go through some PvT replays So far the build I got from PvZ is 14 Pylon scout 17 Nexus 17 gateway 18 gas 2 probes 19 gas 1 probe saturate to 3 for both after 16 16 minerals 100 gateway Core 25 Pylon Stalker WG 150 gas citadel forge And then go from there Seemed to be the base build he went for and then deviated as needed For PvT what seemed to be the go to so far have only looked at 4 5 replays 14 pylon 16 gate 16 gas 1 on gas add more once saturated 19 nexus scout with probe 100 gate core 21 pylon 70 core 2nd gas 100 core WG adept keep making 4th should pop once warp prism is finished 100 nexus robo 50 robo Citadel 100 citadel DT shrine 2 gates resonating glaives 100 wrap prism 2 gas And that seemed to be his base go to so far Hope this helps anyone who is curious how to break down a replay or whatever 3 3 gl gl
It s a twilight council
My god i was looking for some ideas in PvZ I nearly got cancer just by watching zerg doing drops This matchup is ridiculous
Just to let people know he takes down replay packs when he starts streaming the next day as they are part of his donation incentive So grab them fast
Thank you so much for this I love states playstyle and really wanted some lotv replays
Is it the proState
State The same guy who failed to break Proleague
Theres some good terran openings in here too
It doesn t work I can t make them work in sc2I have weird fans
Add snarky eyes We know what you meanI love this thanks for the work I will try out your build
Fan fucking tastic ZvT has been giving me loads of trouble and this guide looks perfect Unfortunately I m out of town and away from my gaming computer for the weekend I m saving this and will be using the heck out of it when I get backWhy would someone trade a 55 controller for a 30 game
download
I wonder how many people that upvoted this gets the reference
Wow that gun is massive
The anti apple circlejerk graces r gaming today
I mean they pretty much had to but I was really happy they gave some sort of explanation for the Tal darim With every single mission that involved them in the previous games I was pretty frustrated it just seemed to be a filler enemy since despite how many missions they are involved in you knew nothing about them except they are evil protoss It also bugged me because I really like the way they let you play as the bad guy factions in SC1 UED Kerrigan Overmind and it wasn t great how they made everyone you play with a hero in SC2 and having such a prominent enemy with unknown motivation was definitely a large part of why the story seemed like a one dimensional good vs evil story
That s understandable The reviews and half the price was enough for me to take the risk and I am a pretty big fan of what I received

No a hole is not made of atoms There can also be holes in gasses like to o zone layer A hole is simply an area where things are less dense than the surrounding area Holes are an indication of less matter aka less atoms
Eh I don t think that comparison is very good The opposite of a shadow would be light and light isn t made of atoms
They show it as hitting the national news and getting millions of view why would you doubt that it went viral
There are so few players playing you are almost always going to be playing top 8 players regardless of what league they are in Last week I got masters for the first time in a year and a half or so I think it is easier to get masters this season that it has been in past seasons I played a total of 3 GMs before I got promoted so few players they were matching a player who was still in diamond against GM I was promoted shortly after spending down my bonus pool so probably about 200 games
He also sprouts a 5 O clock shadow out of no where
Wow holy shit only 0 01 of people in the US are allergic to peanuts this mom is an idiot why is that everyone else s problem After the very least get people on board with referencing candy that doesn t suck balls smarties necco wafers I think you are turning people off from your message
Add the giant title at the top ATTENTION PARENTS like only people with kids participate in trick or treating
Wow remember when this was political suicide in the GOP You know what ever happened to the 99 of the professionals in that area of research are completely abandoning the concept of science and are just doing it for the increase funding
Yeah I had thought about that when I originally thought about it As it is right now there is no diversity so it would be an improvement there It would be a sweet bonus for lower level players to climb the ladder diamond and masters less mobility players are pretty screwed and will always see the same units The more I am thinking about it loading a large amount of 3d models is probably pretty bad for a loading screen I guess this was a good add simply because the models are already pre loaded from the general multi player screen
I like it It would be cool if it changed with the respective leagues with masters or grandmasters being the heroes
oops you On a side note he is clearly loving the costumeI don t actually deserve to be Diamond but the only matchup I m good at happens to be over 50 of my games P
Good for you really Seems like Zerg is the current overpowred race so if they re your best match ups you re in great shape until the next need patches
lol im so bad vZ
Find an all in that works I have like a 65 PvZ by doing a 7 gate Warp prism all inI mean she is hot so I dont mind But this uuh sexy time pose just doesnt fit Okay it fits to the SC II sexy time Kerrigan but as some objekt in my room a bad ass I am the Swarm Kerrigan would be much better then killing Amon Chill Kerrigan
I agree But it s a sick looking statue regardless lol
I agree with this sentiment I am the Swarm Kerrigan is badass but owning this Sexy Time Kerrigan would just make me feel like a pervert Especially misleading with the box art
I can t see her heels
Here ya go
I really like it looks awesome and I think the femme fatale pose is badass Is this the one that is like 25 inches tall too Must be huge hard to tell without scale Also where d you pre order it from Looking online seems pretty expensive
Pre ordered it from Sideshow Collectibles It s currently Waitlisted It was a bit pricey but totally worth it in hand
if the face wasn t so weirdly pale white like that it would be much more awesome but cool
The lighting throws it off a little It s a light green Real light lol EDIT Here s a picFix for the Tank issue Introduce an upgrade with Armory requirement that lowers the siege time to 1 5 seconds That way one of the coolest additions of LotV stays in the game and it restores the importance of positioning in TvT because even if unsieged the better positioned player will get the first volley off Also it would make the Tank more viable vT P and potentially serve as an alternative to Liberators
That s pretty surprizing
Holy fuck I feel for you man This would drive me fucking insane
Fairly sure this is not a network issue I ve had a very similar problem a couple of years ago with my old laptop My GPU was broken damaged by overheating Here s what was happening for me I played the game My GPU was overheating and shut off Screen froze for a split second while the integrated Intel HD GPU took over GPU cooled down Screen froze while GPU took over again GPU overheated etc So what I m saying try to disable your GPU and see if that fixes it If so your GPU is the issue Hope that helps
Yeah you re right I wanted to the answers to be good responses to DKs thoughts but I fucked up in that regard
In Masters this was my experience for the first week but now Zergs got pretty good at stalling with Ravager Corruptor for Hive tech at which point I m the one who needs to adapt
Interesting thanks
If 5 years of SC2 taught us anything it s that free units are always a bad thing
So you got to Plat while only injecting 1 Hatch No wonder Tumescent also made it to Diamond
Based Morrows custom stuff is always great Marine Control has been my go to warm up for ages now
I don t think you ve replied to the right thread
I really like Liberator vs Disruptor fights right now Certainly better than Bio Ghost Viking vs Deathball
There are coins with higher values in other countries
If anything people would go back to BW but that also won t happen
Thanks
So that Toss players get forced into Colo armies every game again Nah They are in a good place right now they are still strong but not so strong that building anything else is stupidI don t actually deserve to be Diamond but the only matchup I m good at happens to be over 50 of my games P
Good for you really Seems like Zerg is the current overpowred race so if they re your best match ups you re in great shape until the next need patches
lol im so bad vZ
Find an all in that works I have like a 65 PvZ by doing a 7 gate Warp prism all inBless you for trying
I see now
I didn t have a pitchfork
I figured it would take them a while A year is actually less time than I thought I just thought they d add a unit every month or so like they did with the roach stalker marauder update
I know it exists I ve played it too It just hasn t been updated since they added the marauders roaches and stalkers That was 6 months ago
I suppose I was just under the impression that a new unit for each race would be added every once in a while
3 days ago So he s still animating apparently but the mod hasn t been updated in 6 months
Moved up north of what South of what How are we supposed to know these things

Yeah even though I play Roach Hydra in ZvT I probably wouldn t use this opener specifically I use the pool first into 4 sneaky lings strategy but I could imagine this build being great versus Protoss and since I m struggling with early game aggression versus Protoss with my current build I think I ll start giving this one a whirl again thanks for replying much appriciated
Hey man sorry for replying at a late time but I was just checking reddit before heading to bed when I got into platinum league and I didn t know any builds your easy build order carried me into high diamond almost immediately after using it http imgur com X8gewoH still got it written down from 1 5 years ago now being a mid master just wondering how this build fares at a higher level could I re learn and still use this as it is or are there any changes I should make to things like gas timings etc If you answer this It s much appriciated

Worms armageddon The game never gets old Problem is a lack of people to play with the AI a mix of complete dead precision can lob a grenade across the map and land it in your 1 2 cm hiding hole and completely inept will only use said grenade for several turns in a row to show off no doubt but still crazy fun to mess around
It s a grief thing Its very irritating but we swallowed it because we knew where it came from to some extent For instance telling a stroke patient there is nothing more that can be done the situation unlikely to improve and we have to wait A lifetime of TV and the media makes them think there are all forms of options but we just don t know them or aren t able to do them Same thing for malignancies or severe autoimmune problems when we talk about palliation or control They get angry or frustrated Other times its speed After 10 days of care some people and their loved ones will get downright nasty as to the lack of progress or slow progress This is also understandable due to possible mounting bills and prolonged emotional stress Then sometimes we just have downright cunts
honestly radio would have been a good choice for me if the job market was available Radios are an envy among us mostly only office hours minimal night shifts and if night shifts almost no work comparable pay the problem is that we need like 20 other physicians for every 1 radio we get and most hospitals around here saturated with radio while still actively seeking the other specializations
neither was i i think i was mostly called hey you
This is so perfect and painful because it hits close to home I feel guilty now If I drop by the radiology dept its always for a report and nothing else it was a long standing hospital inside joke for all physicians
We were actually called resident physicians Some patients used it as a derogatory term Some would say things like what do you know you are only a resident or can I get a real specialist Not even kidding
Was on one of those car carrying ships as a kid standing on the deck alone adults were inside as this whole premise bored them Was enjoying standing against the wind as I had never felt wind that strong At one point the wind was so powerful I could not push against it with all my might It was frightening and I was getting a bit panicked At one point for a brief instant it actually took me off my feet I ran in Learned to respect nature that day and realized how insignificant o can be to even this mild display of mother nature s power

Not knowing which games were good or bad Was the luck of the draw I always got a game for Christmas Because of that I often had to pretend to love it
Is this really doing a lot of good I mean I can t fully be judgemental as the group is doing 99 more than the rest of us but how much of an impact is this having Yes it bars them reaching people but of the people they reach how many are actually out to join up And of those who do how many were going to join up anyway If people were dedicated to join I don t think they would be dissuaded by seeing their twitter it forum go down They would seek other active ones The group I m sure is also creating new accounts and migrating forums On top of that I m not sure how much this group puts weight on using social media go begin with I m imagining something like deleting all social media against McDonalds to curb obesity It may have some impact but not much Lastly they aren t mentioning how its being done Really the bulk of these attacks seem like scripts to detect keywords and spam reporting which isn t the cyberwar the media touts Call me a cynic but it really seems like all this positive press for anon is not so much for their victories but to show the public that groups are rising up and trying to doing something about it to give people hope Like all these TILs about how cancer cures are found daily The news makes the public feel better but a closer look shows that we are quite a bit away from any good progress

Yeah it is that is why I am writing here
It does happen on other servers I will check offline mode when I am done streaming I did not transfer anything except my harddrives They are fine though as far as I can see I checked them with the usual tools and as SC2 is on a SSD anyways it should not be a problem Other than that I changed everything
So the thing is theoretically speaking I do not think that it is hardware related as I had this problem beforehand and I upgraded evevery single piece of Hardware 2 years ago and my Card is not overheating or anything like that checked temps AND it is not happening in any other game I do not even have problems in other games which are graphically a lot more demanding than SC2 I changed all network hardware stuff so there is that I did a clean install of Windows 10 happened on Win7 as well and did multiple clean installs of win7 as well so it is not really software related My Internet is fine acording to all sources Blizzard my Internet Provied I even talkte to EA about another issue and asked them about this one etc eveything is fine I have no problems in other games yeah Thanks for trying though appreacite the effort
well it was possible for zerg to tech to hive in hots too You cannot prevent that but you can force it so zerg does not have a huge bank for 3 upgrades 3 3 and crack and ultras etc and that is all it takes I think It is still really hard for terran once zerg has ultras available but I think someone will figure it out eventually
It is still the same mostly like in hots in terms of general gameplan Get a relatively greedy build maybe even with a quick 3rd cc once you ruled out the ravanger roach allin And then you go out with your first 2 medivacs deny creep and make him fight for a forth base If you can limit him on 3 bases for a while which happens to me more often than in lotv as timings are not refinied yet thats great Get your 4th base up and try to be equal with zerg in bases If you are ahead in bases you will eventually win The Mid Lategame is similar to hots
Liberators Lots of them and then you need to manually target the ultras Normally though if he gets a lot of ultras there were mistakes made in the arly or mid game and his economy was way stronger because of that
I play terran because splitting for what feels like perfectly is just the best feeling in the world Also love that buildings can fly
Yeah it s really interesting but I do not see any other reliable way to stop a nydus In Hots you died to a nydus too if you did hellion builds You survived by killing it before it was done which is now impossible I think you could cc first or 1 rax fe into 2 reapers afterwards for scouting but unless the nydus gets nerved I think that 1 1 1 openings are really hard to do against nydus Maybe with liberators if you can set them up quickly enough and focus the nyds hmmm
I never saw such a play but I guess reactored liberators will do
Nice writeup Thx The nydus worm is the sole reason i tried to go cc first into 3rax as the dps of hellion oppenings seemed to low to kill it if queens went out first It works easily Normally you do die against a ling baneling bust cause of the lack of hellions but I survived one pretty easily with just stim against a GM yesterday Maybe the eco advantage and faster production for terran and a little bit lessened production for zerg makes this bio play actually viable as you have enough stuff to hold zergs bust I think with 2 3 bunkers it is autowin anyways Not sure though just a thought
I have to say this is so emotional manipulation and the arguments are really really weak This really get s to me when nothing else get s to me You know like Top decks don t get to me Losses are natural Like losing a family member that is natural I worked so hard on HearthArena that Natasha almost broke up with me Also if this would have been a 3 man startup like he claims then the risks and money needed should have been shared equally The list goes on and on Way to go
Let s discuss priest here I will experiment with Jeweled Scarab for sure just because it is a 2 drop and the priest card is again not in the first week Otherweise I do not think there is much to get for priest here what do you all think Maybe I am totally wrongBomber TY PartinG Solar Who comes in the lower Bracket Who cares
I like parting and solar because of their inherent skill advantage I don t know why but I think firecake advances out of his group Bomber would probably be the favourite but firecake likes to abuse things and I think he can pull it off Group D is tough No idea on that one Probably TY but anyone can win i thinkI ll check it out Thanks man
It s all in the lips with Harstem

Hey John John huge fan of all of your videos can t wait to see View From A Blue Moon Recently I went to the exhibition of Bernard Testemale for his work Big waves rider of Hawa All of the pictures were incredible but yours was specially above the other I was disappointed that I couldn t get my hands on one of them though Was that a request on your side or just Bernard that didn t wanted to sell yours Can I still get one
Sounds perfect to me Good job
That was some Motley Crue drumming skills you got there Impressive On a side note I can t wait to get my hands on this As a drummer I would simply build the SICKEST set of drums and cymbals Mike Portnoy style jamming like a madman without going bankrupt on the first pair of cymbals
Didn t received any emails even in my spam nothing on indiegogo either
May the gods ever be in my favor Thanks OP

Pretty chilled so far got back to work after a 2 weeks holidays gone surfing most of the time But it has to stop Now it s serious business once again 8 to 6 and then my usual 2 hours of CSGO fix in the evening GLHF

Are you talking about this one
I haven t watched TV this month but I heard something sad happened to Paris Hilton
That s healthy af tho
Shame probes didnt walk into banes
They did
Also you can click on probe while on Spear
There are quite a lot of them in the mission were Purifiers help you
The only Protoss unit that isn t there is Instigator I think and some normal units with skins like Tal darim archon which is normal archon but looks exactly the same as Dark archon
Also she was a scum in WoL and HotS
Things like that happen in LotV too when you play campaign 2nd time and press restart mission I think LotV patch broke something in all campaigns If you want to continue playing with that save just find autosave from that mission and load it They are named mission name checkpoint number like Outbreak 3
If it s bulletproof glass you can call it foursome mirror
Playing pirate map is like playing Hearthstone The more you pay the bigger chances of victory
Yes but you don t get their Spear powers
Only you I think Did you lose connection during the missiion
By playing Tower Defense with a tight way and 6 big cannons at every entrance
So are DLC On one hand more campaign On the other hand less money
To let you check how many times your opponent can get 12 pooled before he learns
I don t think you can get Void Rays here I did this with putting cannons at every entrance and putting 1 shield battery near every cannon to make a wall it makes zerglings Ultralisks walk like it s Tower Defense Also take Photon Overcharge and spam Nexuses EVERYWHERE at the end so Zerg will have to destroy them
They are bugged for everyone I clicked restart mission today and got stalkers without blink and DT without revive masacreI m zerg and the other guy was terran that s the funny part
sorry I meant to say the problem with viewing professional starcraft
Impossible Nishikori will reign
It s a new feature
No it s cool when they come up with new LoTV cheeses but when you re doing 4 gate blink stalker and 14 14 baneling busts and proxy 2 raxes it s so fucking irritating They installed 5 gb just to fucking cheese people who are actually trying to test stuff out it s unranked so it doesn t even matter if they win or not I don t understand the rationale behind these people You get like 3 of these games and most people will just be like fuck it and play a different game Happened to Fenner on stream then he played CSGO the rest of the day
I RUV YOU
I mean it s not like the starcraft crowd right now couldn t use a bit more hype and cheering
those devs are probably all on HoTS now kappa
Can someone tell me why it was removed
Not to be rude or anything but in 2014 there weren t many awesome epic plays that were 1 2 minutes long Not to mention the commentators who never hype up anything these days There were a lot like a lot of amazing games but you can t have a 10 hour highlight video P S sorry lolOh wow Honestly I thought I was going to play on High or even medium Thanks for the help
Yeah That s why SC2 is one of the best games to date
I also have a Dog for my transportation
Can someone ELI5 this
Sadly yes
I could only imagine that underground is worst
That happened to me Back in High school we had a A Program Which is helping Kids with school I was waiting for my ride School got out and almost every single Kindergarten I was a superhero to them waved or smiled at me But one came up to me and gave me a hug and ran off The parent next to me started to smiled at me That little kid made my day I didn t even knew that kid
They want to keep technology for themselves Plus they just came to the Commonwealth and act like they own it
I joined the Institute and WOW That final mission Hell broke lose I couldn t side with the Brother Hood Thugs They sound like they want to control everything and keep things all for them Shaun on the other hide felt like my dad instead of my son At first before founding out that my son is the leader i hated the Institute But after learning more about them I started to realize that they could save the Commonwealth
He s probably one of those people who says FIRST on every youtube comment section
Thanks for telling this deal I Might be interested in buying this instead of the dell
Probably under 950
I heard Newegg isn t a great place to buy comptures That laptop looks good for the price but worried about Newegg
Thanks I was leaning towards the dell too My only issue was the i5 instead of the i7 But that shouldn t matter
They only had money for an artist
I have a problem that every time I save it gets corrupted Lucky it autosaves
So do Obama Speak Russian or Putin speak English
Even though I m not French I still get goosebumpsIt s the percent you play that game mode
Oh right yeah that explains it Thanks
percentage of games played in this mode Maybe its percentage of wins in this mode
correct
Yeah it s the first one Can t be the percentage of wins my 6 9 archon winrate would fill it much more than it does if that were the case Thanks
Percentage of games played per gametype All the bars should equal to one full barThanks
will do once my download is done thank you so much
sweet I will check it out when the download is done
Ah thanks assume its pretty dead for only HotS then ahah
These last two days of the high plat low diamond soloq has been honestly some the worst soloq I have ever had to experience 0 10
HAhahaha I m matched with these two also
Aahahahah that actually made me laugh thank you
Might be mad and toxic to get banned earlier in the year doesn t mean I am not fine now Not everyone can physically control their emotions the same as everyone else
yolo
awesome thank you
thanks
Any where from 75 150 if possible
is that enough to still be heard over a dorm full of rowdy uni teens

i use windows 7 today it screwed up somehow
LEM after 170wins Been playing quake 3 and live semi professional for over 12 years so I learned really quickly I want to hit Global Elite before 300wins If u need any tips how to get from silver elo hell to LEM just ask because I did it

I was actually wondering the other day if you were still working at blizzard glad to see you are right
Yeah I am still at Blizzard just passed my 1 year mark on the same day Void shipped actually
That s really awesome Some day i wish to be working alongside you on starcraft 3
Forgive me of my ignorance but what do you do at Blizzard
I think you mean u rtschutter
Aaaand I fucked it up Thanks for the heads up
Well he work for blizzard sono i survived with a proxy gold base
i got lucky scout
considering that i play an average of 20 games a day and can hit up to 60 games when I don t have school there s a lot of potential here
teleport is 125 energy yamoto is 100
option for banshees liberators are bad compared to banshees at holding ravager ling allins
please only participate if you can afford the flight and hotel to Germany Rip money requirement
too expensive
i think the main problem here is amassing enough siege tanks before you rofldie to the roach ravager attack
1 viper and the title would be viper
oops i am wrong that is a wrong number i misread

surprised this got down voted so much seems harsh
https twitter com LiquidRetI dont like how they divided air and ground Mech upgrades again personally
That a reference to nerfs
Those are thousands of learning and experience that improve the overall efficiency of the people involved Those are never lost
Your ship will start to shake and you ll get a warning if you continue your ship get s destroyed However this is just a temporary thing for the PTU won t be like this in the PU
Terran cause blowing up aliens in the good old human fashion with heavy tanks and huge guns and ex criminals in armored suits is just the way to go That and the Banshee pilot is hot On a more serious note I really like most of the Terran Units and the way they play In terms of my playstyle and what I feel comfortable Zerg would fit me better since I m more the reactionary type but I guess I have to get out of my comfort zone once in a while and it s a necessary sacrifice since I don t like any of the Zergs units or their aesthetics
Well that s a charming way of asking something you apparently know nothing about As explained what you ve seen is the Persistent Test Universe a test server where people can go to test the more unstable builds and help with discovering problems What is going on right now is that the Alpha 2 0 has been released to 15000 people on the PTU and it s highly unstable Those people that play it are dedicated to the development and endure those crashes to help The live server where the stable build is on can be played by anyone who has a game package and a ship It doesn t run so well since optimisation is low on the priority list for any game and this is still in Alpha but it s very stable and playable
I actually have no idea what they re gonna do with hangars in the PU They seem so ridiculously large and a waste of space that realistically you d need to spend a lot of money to maintain them And I d rather park my ship in some dark secure bunker and live in a fancy suit in the hotel across the street than have a super fancy hangar for a ship I d rather fly than look at
No having certain functionalities locked behind a pay wall so to speak would not be very smart Hangars are just there to reflect the amount of money you contributed to the development You get the fancy Revel York because you ve contributed a fancy amount They just differ in aesthetics for now
They look different
Is there any advantage to buying a ship concept during anniversary sale Concept sales include LTI but reoccuring sales for concepts do not so is there any advantage I m very interest in the Sabre however it s a bit expensive and I d have to melt my package for it which would result in me losing access to the game until I can afford a package again Once the Sabre becomes flight ready will it be available for purchase as a package like the other flight ready ships
I liked the tutorial what s wrong about it
Another answer to what I think you re asking There is no seamless transition between your hangar and 2 0 yet We don t even know where are hangar is located at this point so the elevator is basically a magical teleporter for now
THANKS GUYS YOU RE ACTUALLY KEEPING MY HYPE AND ENVY IN CHECK WITH ALL OF THESE REPORTS OF NON FUNCTIONALITY
The goal of the game is whatever you make your goal Whether it be to own all small ships own a capital ship raise your Organisation or yourself to glory explore every corner of the galaxy and so forth Whoever can t handle that kind of freedom won t be happy with Star Citizen This is an MMO a massive multiplayer online game not an MMORPG with dragons and classes and levels and shiny golden daggers that one hit said dragons cause they re super magical
This is about exactly what Chris Robert wants to avoid and therefore Star Citizen will not be
What are the best energy weapons for S2 and S1 right now Got some rec to spend and I want to spend it wisely but I have not been keeping up with that and I don t go well with ballistic weapons as they have ammunition and I usually waste a lot of that trying to hit something
6AM for Central EU That s a bit unfair in my opinion
Miles ahead of you Whenever I see a video from Star Citizen show up on my feed I click on it and am already naked when it starts
Yeah If only I knew how to do that D My video editing and photoshop skills are very basic The UEE vs SPQR Picture was made in Paint
A Sabre and a Vanguard I m in an organisation that aims to be the most prominent private military that people call when they need fire support so my Sabre will be the short range quick response Fighter and the Vanguard my patrol and escort ship Depending on how expensive the Sabre or Vanguard are going to be during the sale I ll most likely melt my Tali for it I just wish the Scimitar had come through it s such a sexy ship
I was playing Rush on Golmud Rail and said The first base is cancer without tanks and I was immediately kicked and perma banned Was my first time on that server Evidently my last too
Yeah I really hope they bring in story events that really have an impact on the gameplay not just this happened while you were sitting in ArcCorp sort of thing explained in a short story on the website like World of Warcraft does it Which is a pretty shitty and lazy way of doing it
Thanks but you know complimenting the visuals in a video that is mostly about the voice audio kinda sends a message DHe had nothing to do with it haha
I love it it s the most fun I ve had in a match up in a long time
I don t know who you talk to but I know a lot of Protosses that struggle in PvT in LotV a LOT I m even a prime example 70 in PvP and PvZ and 36 in PvT I think you re just pulling shit out of your ass
If the match up is so balanced why are there more terrans than Protoss in every league except Gold and under In fact Silver has 2x more Protoss than Terran and Diamond has 50 more Terrans than Protoss If PvT was so easy for the Protoss there would be a higher concentration of Protosses in the higher leagues with a lower concentration of Protoss in the lower leagues
SC2Gears or SCELight SCELight is literally just a more updated version of SC2Gears and I don t believe SC2Gears receives any more updates I could be mistaken
I ve seen Master players stream lose to legit HotS Gold and Platinum Zergs No matter what this shouldn t happen because of the mechanics difference but I guess you re going to make up an excuse for that one too
I ll also point out that once I unlocked the additional Blink upgrades from Vorazun Blink became B again and it ignores the fact that my Stalkers are bound to O using PRM 2 0 I have a feeling this is because it changes Blink to another spell called Blink that has the 40 shield regeneration but that spell isn t re bindable
I can t get specific hotkey suggestions since I m unfamiliar with RRM 2 0 but what I can suggest is the fact that both of your new units are morphed versions of previous units So you can use whatever hotkey morphing from ling to bane or from corruptor to BL on the roach and Hydra for the Ravager and Lurker respectively For the Lurker Den you can use the same hotkey you would use from Hatch Lair or from Spire Greater spire Then with Hold Fire from Lurker I m not entirely sure what would be best but Corrosive Bile and whatever the Corruptor spell is called should probably be one of your default spell hotkeys like whatever Fungal Growth is Hope this helps D EDIT Emotes hate me
It s a glitch that sometimes happens when you get placed or rank up It basically just means you have 3 bonus pool ignore the negative sign
I think you feel too entitled to his time He gave his reasons why he wasn t doing SC2 content and they were valid reasons I don t clamor for Day9 Acting like he is a horrible person for stopping SC2 content and then resuming after an expansion is just entitlement
He s being sponsored and paid by NVidia to play Fallout 4 so it makes sense
He s being sponsored by NVida to stream Fallout 4
What race do you play This is what I do for PRM 2 0 For Protoss I do H for Adept make sure to set this for both Gateways and Warpgates o for Adept Psionic Transfer 0 for Disruptor o for Disruptor Purification Nova 9 for Adept upgrade at Twilight Council m for Oracle stastis Trap o for Immortal Barrier m for Carrier Release Interceptors
5 10 min queue for a 1v1 when not at top mmr is pretty low support It s not going to sell copies to do backwards compatibility so it s not worth their time and money
Last time I tried playing WoL I had queues of 5 10 min In HotS I get queues of around 5 30 seconds I don t think there are a lot of people supporting WoL
Welcome to retail where products decrease in monetary value over time Why would a game that was 60 5 years ago still be 60 now This is a clear misunderstanding product value If you want is good now you pay top dollar If you want what was good and new 5 years ago you pay less because it s considered to be worth less It s not a difficult concept And if you want a more detailed explanation for a product s value declining here is one example Game comes out devs need to make a certain profit They release the game at 60 dollars with a minimum of X copies to sell to make a profit Y expected sales and then Z being actual sales Until X copies are sold a price drop will more than likely not be considered unless there is a new expectation that Y will be less than X and you need to drop the price to get to X sales If you get to X sales in a reasonable amount of time the price will not be dropped ideally until you reach Y sales If you are unable to reach Y sales then in order to sell more copies you need to drop the price If you want to ignore the basic algebra behind it they will sell a game at the maximum price they can get away with so that they can get the most money out of people who are going to purchase it regardless and will not drop the price until there is a considerable drop in sales later down the line hence the product losing it s value over time They reduce the price a bit sell a few more copies and keep doing that until they reach the lowest threshold they are willing to sell the game at
Idk I disagree with this I ve had no problem scouting as long as you do a regular worker scout you can get there before the opponent has anything out to deal with your scout The only match up where that is less true really is XvT because Terran s wall will finish while your scout is in their base so it s doomed to die But otherwise you have plenty of time
Except if you read the updated Reddit post by Xeno you would see that Rifkin isn t at fault This is purely between Xeno and enginepeon you just want an excuse to talk shit on Rifkin from what I can see without any effort on follow up research I would like to see your contribution to the community in relation to what Rifkin has done
That s not how Kickstarter works that s how the exchange of goods works
If he didn t sign anything he s not actually required to fulfill his end of the bargain but BTTV is required to fulfill their end of the bargain through Xeno Obviously idk if they had him sign anything but I m assuming they didn t
The problem with HT builds which I ve been experimenting a lot is that you don t have anything to deal with a roach hydra composition Currently Chargelot Archon is great vs really fast Lurkers and Roach Ravager but if they do standard Roach Hydra they will just roll right over you In PvT it s just that Widow Mines are so good vs Chargelots and they don t have the splitting ability of Marines or Zerglings due to their speed so Widow Mine heavy pushes can destroy you
Interesting theory I don t find that very true for me personally as my best winrate is PvP and then PvT but I see Terran as more BM But I can see what you re getting at since it s usually the loser who s bming the most
NGL this is the precise reason why I brought this up LOL Bragging rights all But it s also important for everything to be consistent right Right
I think it is because it also doesn t register clicking on the minimap either so it just in general doesn t count camera movement This might be because with how the engine is built they would have to register all camera movement as an action which would make screen scrolling complicated But that s just a guess I obviously don t know the answer as to why or why notalways good news
Thats what i always expected No surprise imo
Finally I can stop tearing my hair out Thanks OP
Don t thank me thank based god carmac
And here I was afraid it would end up like Dreamhack Hope they won t disappoint us in the end
Carmac should be happy he prob got spending money now that MTG bought up the scenePedrows 1828 NA Spectate quest
Thanks for the answer guys will be checking those gods Just one more thing Mercury Nemesis and Thanatos aren t used anymore They used to be played on jungle
Oh i had completly forgot about the Rhino Thanks for the answer
Malfurion is even stronger now i would put him in the top tier picks There was also a change in displacement not canceling channeling anymore lili s ult for example is not canceled with displacement spells only stuns so that also affected some heroes I think since sylvanas patch uther was also nerfed but he is still a good support in my opinion Stiches was heavily nerfed so not a very good pick anymore Sgt hammer is also kinda bad in the meta right now mainly due to Kael Thas and a more mobile playstyle
Is it up already or only on the 2nd
All the decks i play right now i have the cards to play it and the legendary would be an upgrade to it but not really essential The other decks that requires an essential legendary that i don t have requrie more cards that i don t have handlock still missing 2nd copy of each giant control warrior missing more then 1 legendary That s why i m mostly on doubt between ragnaros and sneeds but would like to hear more advice first
Samb00l just donated 1200 dollars
It really depends on how many classic cards you have if you don t have many or you re lacking more usefull classic cards then gvg cards then just go for classic and you can craft the gvg cards you need
thank you very much Guess it was a stupid answer but i thought once you linked your account it was automatic
Well yeah thats the thing my other cards doesn t really allow me to play a deck needing to craft only one legendary For example i cant play handlock simply by crafting jaraxxus because i m missing 1 of each giant Currently i m playing mostly ramp druid and I don t think it really needs any other legendary don t think harrison would benefit the deck rag has no space maybe sneeds but i don t kno
Yea i always disenchant golden cards but as this is my only copy i kept it in case i would ever use it but since it is not being played on any deck i started to think about DESince it seems to be an issue with blizzard and Bell I jumped onto the European server for now and started playing right away Cross region play turns out to be pretty awesome
I m with Bell and from ON
There is a list of things that already counter a unit that can t shoot up Ghosts liberators bcs perhaps even cyclones in the right situation Ultras are pretty strong though I d like to revisit this topic in 2 months after a meta appears Maybe pros will figure out how good ghosts are before then
There is a middleground the developer should reach in order to match popularity for sure By making tournaments every 2 hours they are still accessible to everyone while they are rare enough that the game feature will still be interesting 6 months from now Shoving a tournament down our throat every hour is a perfect way to make them a boring gimmick down the road Blizzard did it perfectly by testing this out for a week long event a very rational choice IMO
Woah TIL Thanks for the info as a Polt fan I am pleased to hear he has that option
This made me wonder how players like Polt have put off military for so long According to liquipedia Polt is 27 Another would be Bomber who is nearly 30 iirc While Forgg for reference is only 25
And here in Canada i ll just be downing oatmeal and rice like the pleb I am
Well that explains half of my losses on ladder Unplayable game
Ya absolutely this is a great point Also if the league even announces that they might start random drug testing for coke it s a good first step to combat potential heavy users Few of the majority are going to risk their multimillion dollar job for drug charges It might be enough to slow down the pandemic a lot of people say we have
Do some research on microdosing if you haven t Using coke or other amphetamines while playing is absolutely a possibility
I play random to improve in every match up It also makes watching tournaments more fun
I will say he does do good thinks for the scene for a niche crowd He s not highly attractive to the mainstream mostly due to his occasional unprofessional attitude But that s entirely understandable he s not a professional caster and he hasn t been bred into one If you lack some professionalism you can make up for it like Nathanias does with charisma though Grahm doesn t really have that Looking at his example of the screen grab It s totally fine up until grahm says ya and we are MAIN WCS stream so you wait Poignant example of a lack of experience professionalism here I can t name a single other caster that would have voiced that the same way It s fair evidence that you dig yourself into many of the situations that your so called esports dirt folder contains
I worked this summer with a job that paid for my groceries and the group I was working with ate 2 circles of brie a WEEK 2 of 4 ppl were french Canadian 1 of 4 was from France Me being the only non french one experienced a summer of eating more brie and cheese than any normal human should comsume It was glorious I only get it on the rare occasion now because it s pretty expensive relative to other foods
Is he in Proleague If so what team is he playing for
I just spent my morning watching this and wow I m glad I did That is Mvp levels of comeback awesomeness
Everyones talking about the geese and eagle but how about that blue heron at the top left That dudes just scheming and plotting his attack in a timely fasion
Game three Shana delayed his expo to go cloak banshee doing some damage to his economy Lilbow makes stalker to defend while sending two dts delaying mining Shana makes raven marine seige tank and seiges lilbows nat Lilbow eventually defends with stalkers and dts both players take a 3rd and settle things down After macroing for a while both armies clash in the middle of the map while lilbow destroys Shanas worker line with adepts Both players are low army supply Shana has 0 workers and GG s Map score 2 1 Lilbow
Game two Lilbow defended a proxy reaper widow mine and liberator cheese without much loss but then lost his warprism to two liberators trying to counter push Shana macroed on two base and made marine marauder with tanks and liberators mixed in He defended Lilbow s adept stalker push while harassing with liberators Lilbow tried one last push with warprism and GG d Map score 1 1
He just won game one with a cool adept warprism rush off two base The marine target fire was done well enough but let s wait till he faces a korean like FlaSh

Pretty close game I didn t expect that
Babcock covers his mouth when he talks Does the toronto media interpret by lip reading if he doesn t
If we get one point from this game i ll be so happy NYR are a good teamSeeing a lot of responses to threads I ve seen on here and team liquid Really great to see That bunker change idea literally came out in the middle of the sandisk invitational cast
It s clear blizzard reads r starcraft
What s the bunker idea I haven t seen the description anywhere
Neosteel becoming an individual upgrade for a bunker rather than a passive upgrade
What s the neo steel passive upgrade I play Zerg sorry never heard
It just bumps the bunker capacity from 4 to 6 Almost no one gets it though It s too costly and pushes other upgrades from the engineering bay back for too long to be worth it
Has this always been in the game I ve never seen anyone use it to my knowledge and I ve been playing sc2 at a high diamond masters level since WoL launch This is sad to me if that s the case
Yeah it s almost completely unheard of Especially in the higher skill bracket And what s worse is that there is no possible way that you have seen it and just didn t notice on account of the obvious remodel the bunker gets
Bunker have 2 extra slots for units to get it 2 more marines or 1 more marauder and a normal cc and pf have 5 more slots for workers to jump in
Fix for the Tank issue Introduce an upgrade with Armory requirement that lowers the siege time to 1 5 seconds That way one of the coolest additions of LotV stays in the game and it restores the importance of positioning in TvT because even if unsieged the better positioned player will get the first volley off Also it would make the Tank more viable vT P and potentially serve as an alternative to Liberators
I like it a late game upgrade that stops the early harass maintains tank lines most of the game and allows for an upgrade that shifts the game later
Maybe helps v ultras lategame
That s a very huge maybe The ultras would still close distance and when they do you would need to hot pickup the tanks stim your army kite the ultras backward and reposition the tanks and wait out the 2 second delay before they re allowed to fire again I still don t see tanks being a viable solution unless some more fundamental changes are made regarding cost supply etc
Ya I can agree with that sentiment I only suggested it because tanks are so rarely used in the matchup now unless in the early game Mech just can t keep up with Zerg
yup and mech falls victim to the whole one big push wonder and when it fails the game is probably over
Tanks are not good versus ultras
I think it is still a good idea for the tanks to drop unseiged which makes the current type of play less viable IE pushing with medivac marine and dropping the tanks when you get close The Bastetrade TVT tournament was pretty much entirely that one tactic
It s amazing but it also takes a shitload of attention and micro It has one of the biggest downsides which is I can t do much else while I do this Still I think players rely on it as a crutch if it is effective propping up their harass despite not being better than their opponents I d much rather the tanks unseiged when they came out
yeah i see nothing wrong with pickup of a sieged tank this is really good change in some ways Dropping it in a presieged state does create that odd interaction about mobile mech and bio they point out
You need to realize that the terran who s spending all that time microing that siege tank drop is gonna be banking up minerals gas It is not a totally costless thing to do Also you re aware the drop was nerfed The siege tank isn t allowed to fire for 2 seconds after being dropped Stephano kinda had that problem solved even during the beta right click the group of lings on the dropshop so the tank can never land Focus your queens on the dropship Tank drops kinda suck vs zerg Tank drops to be honest have fallen out of vogue these days It s not seen in TvT anywhere near where it was during beta and even if it is an old school marine hellion drop does far more damage It s just sad when a tank drop is countered by a single viking and we Terrans all know this so we just kinda stopped doing tank drops
I like this I would go even further and just say we should just lower the siege time requirement in general to make them more viable in all matchups and retain positioning benefits Then maybe force them to unsiege when picked up by a medivac The reason for the across the board buff in my eyes is that mech being a viable composition requires that the tank be the bread and butter of the army and right now I m just not sure that is possible
nah I think they shuold keep the siege time being able to rescue tank with medivac is enough of buff in mobility department Instead they should make the tank itself stronger when sieged I mean whole point of siege tank is to have firepower in exchange of total mobility Right now it has neither
If you want TvT mech vs mech only then this is a great change
That s the case in Brood War and it s fucking incredible
Guess what LotV isn t Brood War
This is awesome feedback I m glad they aren t addressing the balance whine yet and are focusing on issues that they perceive as design issues that s exactly the correct mindset to have in the offseason after a new expansion was released Good job Blizzard As for the feedback itself I do think TvT would be more interesting if tanks unsiege on load because right now we don t get to see positional tank lines at all they re basically being used like Reavers in Shuttles If there was at least a soft incentiev to not pick up your tanks then you d have to actually think about where you siege up
Also you could pick up two tanks at once
That s some good positive feedback Thumbs up Blizzard
They should allow people to submit coop maps to be played Kind of like Super Mario Maker P
What was the bunker upgrade thing again
Neosteel frame Currently you can invest some cash in the engineering bay The problem is that Ebays should be used for upgrades on priority That makes the other upgrades have to wait until 3 3 is done which essentially makes them useless The suggestion Players were saying that the upgrade should require certain tech like engineering bay but then the bunker itself can be upgraded to have neosteel plating for an individual cost It might affect bunker rushes in the early game but it will certainly help terran hold a third base against rava roach timings as well as some of protoss shenanigans EDIT I should probably mention that neosteel frame allows 2 extra spaces on the bunker That means 3 marauders or 6 marines It s a pretty nice upgrade but committing 100gas and 110 sec not sure in lotv time to get the upgrade AND delay your upgrades Just isn t worth it in its current form If its like a 25 25 upgrade on an individual bunker it would probably worth it
Sounds like a pretty good change
It does sound like it would help terrans hold against early ravager pushes although the meta should start shifting towards opening with tanks instead of liberator But I m also worried about the impact it will have on bunker rushes
bunker rushes are already much weaker compared to hots and if you need to upgrade the bunker and have an ebay it would be very hard to use it so eary in the game
Tanks vs roach ravager isn t good at all Tanks aren t that great vs roach until you hit crit number although it is great at softening them up but usually you have 1 maybe 2 tanks by time roach ravager timing hits Ravager is non armored and doesnt take bonus from tanks The answer for ravager timings are banshees not tanks Tanks are sitting ducks vs ravagers and simply isn t powerful enough
Oh man Here we go again with the bunker changes
I m down for another wild ride I think watching zergs defend proxy rax is my favorite cheese
Hellow everybody i wanted to give my opinion concerning mech tvt drop tank I think that mech is really bad right now for two reason The first one is that lotv is obviously way more dynamic when it comes to expanding as a mech player you always need alot of turret and a big army around 170 pop to secure a 4th base quite safely on lotv the timing of the 4th is way earlier than this supply cap this reason is already a big buff to bio play for the whole game when it will come to expand even more bio will have the advantage obviously but for air transition it will be also be a big deal right The second one is that in the past you had to scout well and adapt to the mech air army making tech lab to kill the ground with banshee or some reactor to take back heavily air control with viking since lotv you just have to make some reactor and you will be able to kill mech army ground air with viking liberator and just finish the game if your opponent have a big air army since the start he wont be able to expand and take control of the game So drop tank in my opinion almost doesn t affect bio vs mech at all your idea that it helps escaping from big fight with your tank is not realistic everytime you fight as mech vs bio tank u ll have the viking advantage and will kill every medic that will try to come close to the fight Concerning tvt bio vs bio it gives a really weird dynamic but i dont have an opinion yet concerning that maybe it s giving good game maybe not we will see Bunker upgrade great idea finally take care of not giving us something too strong Balance overall doesnt look bad especially with this really weird and probably bad map pool most pro think that zerg is too good vs protoss Co op missions are awesome i really think you should give us really hardcore brutal missions and a way bigger range of mission anyway 15 20 to start maybe Give us skin
Revert the siege tank to greatness http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Siege Tank Heart of the Swarm Patch Changes increase life from 150 to 160 if overkill is implemented siege mode damage changed from 35 15 armoured to 60 70 if overkill is implemented siege mode upgrade damage changed from 3 2 armoured to 4 5 if overkill is implemented attack cooldown increased from 2 8 to 3 0 i e takes longer note these are old Blizzard time seconds unsieges upon medivac pickup If a nerf is necessary first look into increasing the attack cooldown Reducing life can come second but keep its high damage A strong siege tank is awesome and makes it a unique unit
The Starbow design is like that as well pick up a sieged tank and it unloads in tank mode It doesn t allow for any really fanciful siege tank kiting but as everyone has already said fanciful good especially in combination with the medivac It might be more prudent to remove something so powerful which makes the siege tank so well rounded and removes its main weakness
And make the unit nearly worthless in every other matchup I hope they will not do that And if they do I d like to see them at least having 7 range in tank mode or something
How will it make it worthless in every other match up
Tanks will only be used in TvT In HotS we would see an occasional TvZ mech game where tanks were used but even those are disappearing Mech is weaker than it s ever been
Wasn t every zerg and his mother bitching about mech TvZ at the end of HotS
For a month or two then it got sort of figured out Majority of the late GSL SSL games and Blizzcon games were bio Plus in LotV mech isn t as good because they nerfed ravens added ebola cloud ravagers and the economy makes turtle play much worse I don t think the best terran mech army can even beat viper broodlord corruptor Maybe with ghosts
ebola cloud
Parasitic bomb that aoe air to air spell
good source please do not discuss on that level It is quite obvious that in the current state of LotV tanks will be obsolete in any mid to lategame Especially without tankivac micro Not to even speak about tvp Everyone who knows anything about the game knows tanks suck dick in LotV even more than ever adepts carriers tempests major warpprism buffs even disruptors and the more spread out economy it should be quite obvious
I mean everyone was complaining about it because Korean terrans were destroying everyone with it for a while Your source of it s quite obvious isn t all that much better
Sorry but this is just not true I guess it isa typical case of selective perception which happens quite often here on reddit Yes there were a lot of games for a small time period in late hots were some players won with kinda disgusting mech style games But Just look at the wcs grand finals every tvz was won by zerg Life Innovation Hydra Dream and Rogue Maru And yes everyone went for some mech
Maybe but forum whiners aren t exactly the wisest about balance If mech was as strong as some said we would ve seen it far more often in pro games The pros use whatever gives them the greatest chance if victory which in TvZ happens to be bio
Pros were destroying every one with it too
What does destroying everyone mean statistically If it wasn t a higher win percentage than bio then it s meaningless
It s not even really used in TvT anymore I m not seeing it anywhere near the level it was during beta A single viking is all that s required to counter the early tank harass kinda sad and all the more so that the sieged tank isn t allowed to fire for 2 seconds upon landing
Well I dont know about you but I am using tanks quite regularly in the other matchups right now And I probably still would if I could pick them up sieged to drop unsieged behind my army to save them
Yeah I use them in every matchup too
You ok you might use them but i saw no tanks in any lotv tournament And if there were some they were always used with medivacs If you know mech pro games please link me
I do not know if I like this change design wise but in tvp and tvz this will decrease the tank use even more Mech gets weaker and weaker Viper Ultra Broodlord adrenaline glance adepts carriers spread out Economy disruptor faster creepspread all these changes are horrible for mech while mech only got the tankivac and the cyclone as buffs for mech and the tankivac now might fall So why would anyone do anything else than bio sad times for terran imo
It would also make XvT a lot more fun too I m all for this change
Yea it s kind of a joke right now almost feel like an open game server where retarded sht is allowed
You mean identical to HotS TvT Yay edit It is hilarious to see terrans happy with this change Idiots edit 2 mech players build vikings
Siege Tanks just need a straight up damage boost The solution to the units problems seem to avoid making it better at its main role which is to park somewhere and say to the opponent come at me bro
Fully agree for comparison the ravager corrosive bile does 60 splash damage Let s think about that Compare the ravager against the siege tank which does 35 light 50 armored damage It just highlights how horribly bad the unit is
I don t really understand how stronger siege tanks lead to stronger bio in the situation he mentioned But then again I m a scrub
Mobility via medvacs makes the tank way way more mobile and sustains the firepower of tanks which is what makes mech strong iiiin the first place Bio simply out does mech in its current form
Bio in this case is marines medivacs and tanks as opposed to mech which is primarily factory starport units Because you are building medivacs for healing your marines anyway and you aren t making as many tanks as a mech player a lot of the time you can pick up all your tanks in siege mode Your army is only as fast as its slowest unit If you can pick up all your tanks then your army is only as slow as your marines Meanwhile mech still has to siege and unsiege the old fashioned way Even if they use some medivacs to carry their tanks they never have enough for all of them Before mech was slow but it had the power of siege tanks Now mech is still slow but bio also has the power of siege tanks
Oh okay then its just an issue of naming that confused me I guess I was still in HOTS thinking where bio was the 4M and including tanks made it bio mech
Bunker change hype
co op missions should be like Greater Rifts get harder and harder forever Higher and higher levels would force a transition to tier 3 units I can beat brutal co op by massing 3 3 zealot dragoon OK it taught me how to macro success Teach me how to transition now Before you know it a good do op player is now ready for 1v1 D
So it begins Patch 6 version 0 8 0 14593 Build time decreased from 40 seconds to 30 seconds Patch 16 version 0 19 0 15976 Bunker build time increased from 30 to 40 Patch 17 version 0 20 0 16036 Bunker build time decreased from 40 seconds to 30 seconds Patch 1 1 0 Build time increased from 30 to 35 Patch 1 3 0 Build time increased from 35 to 40 Patch 1 3 3 Salvage resource return reduced from 100 to 75 Patch 3 0 X Bunker upgrade change
I thought Adepts were declared the new Bunkers during the beta
Reddit where references take the place of humor
I need to say that all points mentioned in update are very much in line with what our community was saying for some time already Cool to see that Blizz is listening I was hoping for more details about Z nerf and or P buff as that seems to be something that needs more focus Anyway very good Comm Feed
I mean its understandable to not bring up balance issues immediately before the first major tourney
It s also a feedback update not a balance patch yet
about the burrow issue why not give the players the OPTION TO CHOOSE and since they seem to be fixing smaller issues now how about fixing one thing morphing a mothershipcore which is not at full HP into a mothership results in a mothership that does not have full HP Sometimes you need to kill your own mothershipcore before morphing it into a mothership because of this stupid thing Even a 1hp corrupter will result in a full hp broodlord
As you say it s a small issue but I think you re probably right
F2 will no longer select Disruptor shots SC2 a game for casuls confirmed s
just for protoss
I for one am proud I didn t know that was an issue
Glad they are pointing out who the target audience of Co op missions are I think a good way to make them harder while still encouraging casual players to play them is by increasing difficulty gaps between Normal Hard and Brutal with a game speed increase above Normal This way it s still easier on Normal but Brutal will be closer to the campaign level of difficulty Also make sure to do the balance test map for the burrow changes the number of users who try it shows the level of interest in the change
Just make a difficulty level above Brutal No reason to mess with what s there already
The more difficulties you add the worse it will get better to change what you have than add more and more and more tiers
That doesn t make sense Adding a new difficulty does not make it worse it just adds another level of difficulty for people who are finding brutal too easy
Then why don t they do it for Campaign If you look at Blizzard s history they just alter the difficulty of each existing one rather than add new ones It s easier more intuitive and helps people not learn new things constantly
What This makes no sense at all People learn how to play it on X difficulty so instead of making a new difficulty you will make then relearn how to play on a previous difficulty and say it s more intuitive I don t think you know what that word means There is really no precedent for this as there has been no co op based missions Adding a new difficulty is simpler then readjusting all the other ones You know that the current ones are working so just make a new one and bump up the difficulty That way people who just want to play on normal don t suddenly get an undesired difficulty spike
I don t understand why for some reason the people here don t seem to understand or care that co op mode is meant to cater to all audiences and not just to the 1337 GM level that these guys all seem to imply that they are I am fully in favor of Extreme mode which I understand already exists in the game but is currently locked away I would like to see more maps for sure and a Raid boss mode which poses a new level of challenge which all but requires both players to use maxed out heroes to stand a chance of a beating
Then you haven t been around long enough to see how Blizzard balanced difficulty between expansions which is fine I ll stick with history though over non intuitive ideas
What I ve been around since warcraft 1 There is no history here You re talking about an expansion pack being harder than the original game That was fine for campaign when the expansion pack required the original game Such as Frozen throne BW and Beyond Dark Portal They were all harder than Vanilla because there was an assumption that people had already gotten used to the races by playing through the original game and thus no Make a barracks and train 5 footmen missions were needed This is something completely different The intuitive thing would be just to add an extra difficulty or two to co op because 1 This is a stand alone so you can t operate under the assumption that people know all 3 races and 2 People who are just playing for fun might not like their normal difficulty suddenly getting harder Look up the word intuitive because you are not using it correctly
Many of my friends find Normal too easy and Hard too hard increasing the difficulty between Normal and Hard would just exacerbate the problem
The worse what will get Plenty of games do this without issue Add a Legendary mode or something
I am excited for the future of coop I would loved to see like themed mission DLC like Broowar Missions or like character themed Was talking to a friend about this and we both agreed Like we love just sitting back and relaxing and chatting as we do coop and it s good fun Also would love a balance post Parasitic Bomb is gross lurkers are gross and zerg seems super strong Parasitic Bomb is so strong that it basically doesn t make you split it makes you avoid it or you lose your air army Very frustrating
What do you mean it doesn t make you split You should always be worried about clumping your air army together ZvT It s just one more thing to worry about
I mean as a Protoss sorry Like splitting Pheonix doesn t help they just die anyways it seems So much single target DPS too
Phoenix counter vipers pretty hard as they are light armor Even if you trade in a couple of phoenixes vipers are so expensive it s probably favorable Just like zerg have to be careful of thor liberator destroying mutas you have to keep an eye out and try not to clump your air army
Vipers aren t light they re armoured
Oops my bad Phoenix still kills them pretty fast though
I m pretty sure 3 Pheonix will die to a bomb before they kill a single viper with micro
How is the stalker blink on dusk towers a bug I thought that was intentional considering it makes so much sense Really sad they re removing it
F2 no longer selecting disruptor shots is a big plus in my book
Sounds like we managed to make Davie proud Good job Screddit
while we are at the f2 discussion I think we should be allowed to decide what f2 actually selects
I can t believe they want to nerf the siege tank to make mech viable lol Maybe in TvT but seriously did they completely give up on mech in tvp and tvz Do this change but please buff the tank in some way pleas Viper Ultra Broodlord adrenaline glance adepts carriers spread out Economy disruptor faster creepspread all these changes are horrible for mech while mech only got the tankivac and the cyclone as buffs for mech and the tankivac now might fall
Give siege tank in siege mode priority to attack massive vs massive attack bonus after upgrade unlocked by fusion core
Would the individual bunker upgrade remove the ability for command centers to store additional workers When you get neosteel frame the amount of SCVs that a CC can load increases as well I actually use this sometimes if I m expanding to an island so that I can load up 10 15 SCVs into the CC right away Also how would salvage work with this
Parasitic bomb needs to be nerfed The closest comparison to this spell is Irradiate from brood war Irradiate did not stack and had to be researched Science vessel were more expensive than vipers and it did not have consume to rapidly gain energy Despite this it was still an extremely strong ability pretty much shutting down muta play the moment its researched Whats even crazier is that brood war didn t have smart casting while sc2 does The graphical indicator on parasitic bomb need to be clearer as well Its very difficult compared to irradiate to tell with unit the spell is on
Blizzard you are simply amazing
Still nothing about potential nerfs to Liberator and Lurkers
Not even a mention of the balance issues is a bad move imo Seriously they need to nut up and just say they are holding off on balance changes for the moment if that is their position It feels way worse to have no recognition that balance is likely out of whack and they just need more data to make their changes
if tank pickup is changed to have them un siege then there s basically no reason to pick them up unless you want to save them from being killed That change would destroy more or less any offensive drop play
I believe the tank pick up was designed to save them not offensive play So this should not bother them
On the other hand sieged tanks are almost essential to defend ravager roach early pushes If tanks are no longer sieged after dropped by medivac it may become more difficult for T to defend Still I think that could be fixed by doing something to ravagers which would benefit all match ups
It will definitely become more difficult to defend Lifting tanks in siege was the only way to easily dodge corrosive bile shots I don t think they should get rid of tank lift but they should definitely make a viable way for terran to dodge bile shots with tanks
bear in mind that if the tank is unsieged upon pick up well there you go The ravager has basically accomplished its mission because now you have to drop the tank again siege it back up and meanwhile you re still under fire I would like them to leave the tank drop thing alone It s been already nerfed tanks can t fire for 2 seconds upon being dropped
you can still harrass with the proposed siege tank Tank drops will happen still but you don t sacrifice the tank in the way you used to in hots
Yep it just makes it a bit safer I actually like tank drops but this isn t a bad solution since you can still harass with tanks and other units but now you can save the tanks while still maintaining positioning micro
well hang on we never sacrificed tanks or even want to If you lose all your tanks in a push guess what The push is effectively over Those tanks had better get decent value for their cost supply or what good are they
The 2 medivac bio with 2 some tanks drop that saw some play in hots was sacrificing at least 1 tank to get some damage done This is a form of harrass one that Blizz wanted to strengthen All the proposition changes is that you can get a tank out and harrass more effectively because the tank lives longer and can be re dropped
You re gonna have to show me some replays because HotS was not about the tank It was about the widow mine and the 4M push
I never said it happened often but it happened occasionally as something different to do on ladder Blizz strengthened it as an option and even with this change it s still viable That s all I said
I agree It s more about hot pickup from the start And this change may bring back more positional plays while allowing more micro opportunities to save them in unfavorable positions
for the love of god david please do something about zerg
Still no word about ravagers they need their armored tag back Invulnerable nydus needs a fix too
What s the point of these posts if they don t mention legitimate balance concerns Nothing about liberators lurkers ultras photon overcharge It was pretty great when Blizzard was iterating so quickly on balance in beta and now when the balance actually matters they take a nap
Or it could be that what you think needs changing they don t Most of things you list don t seem to be a problem for balance
Blizzard addressed all of these things in the last feedback post except ultras so they clearly know that these are balance issues It s just super confusing that they are waiting to make any changes or even SUGGEST changes
Because at most the game has been out a month You have to realize that DK and his crew have to sort through pages and pages of posts full of absolutely useless complaints That s why the beg the community to post constructively and realistically If you go off the handle spewing bullshit about how this is broken and that is broken it doesn t give them an opportunity to see the actual good posts that legitimately explain the problem or post evidence of it Moreover blizzard monitors win rates extensively They analyze the shit out of games to find out what is actually fucking up the matchup and what isn t I think the reason SH and Infestor BL lasted so long is because the choice to nerf the unit would have been completely counter to what their design was in the first place Maybe in hte future if we learn to actually post constructively instead of flaming blizzard we will get a faster response My guess is that the units you mention are in the game to force players into playing differently In the past we had no reason to spread air units besides mutas against the thor wm Now every race has to do it People will adjust and figure out how to deal with pbomb Give the players time to innovate At least they are trying instead of just bitching about it online
Ok that s all great but this is the one outlet that the balance team has to communicate with the fanbase and it feels odd that they don t discuss the issues that a lot of people are complaining about If only to say we don t think unit is imbalanced and here is why And I get that the game has only been out for a month but during the beta there were balance patches on a weekly basis Then the game releases and they just stop The same people were complaining about the same things when beta was still going on and they weren t addressed then and haven t been addressed since the game has gone live Also what about something like chronoboost where David Kim has said several times that he doesn t think the design of it is that good and will need to be changed No mention of what might change about chronoboost since the current iteration was put in place other than dkim saying it s not a great design I love the community interaction but it feels really half assed
Most recently David mentioned chrono at the blizzcon panel I think it was during the Q A session it was very clear he wasn t really pleased with the way chronoboost currently works and that it will likely change Also I think you are missing my point I m not saying that blizzard should balance the game every week like they were in the beta It s more like these problems mostly with Zerg have been present for the last few months and haven t been balanced in the beta or otherwise and have hardly even been discussed
How do you objectively know it s a problem though are you gauging this based on watching streams or looking at ladder rankings Have we had official win rates disclosed yet Currently Korean GM ladder has zerg at 35 of the population 32 32 for T and P On U S it s something a lot higher but that has to do with the fact that NA generally has higher zerg population
There s lot of problems but I ll just focus on the Ultra in TvZ Yes they are harsh powerful But I think Blizzard doesn t want us to stick to bio all game long anymore We have to try different solutions such as liberators which do fantastic vs Ultralisks only problem is if the zerg decides not to engage of course Then there s the new ghost drone thing which I ve yet to see anyone else including myself It sounds like you really must be cloaked to use it otherwise don t bother trying My own miscellanous thoughts I really do not like what they did to Raven Auto Turrets They were incredibly nerfed only 7 second timer wow What can you even accomplish with that They really really didn t want us to be able to do the whole mass raven thing anymore so they killed it Siege tanks need to relook at regarding their cost 150 125 3 supply unit which is inferior to the ravager in nearly every respect
they probably have ideas but choose not to share them since dreamhack is tomorrow Declaring specific things OP right before hand will hurt the tourney hype and why make statements like that then the best test of current balance is about to happen For all anyone knows parting will rip out some insane pvz build and rocks the tourney Idk There is just very little to gain by saying something right now
The point of this is not only balance issues I would question the point of these if it only was balance issues as blizzard stated in their past 2 feedback updates which you clearly forgot about balance is not a primary concern as it is too soon to judge
What s the issue with lurkers The very rare times they ve been made in the recent online tourneys they didn t do that much I do think that Ultras could lose one armor and the cast range on the Ravager bile should be reduced though Sucks that they make tanks so bad in TvZ
I m not sure those are really the main balance issues at the moment
What are the main balance issues then He only forgot ravagers in my book
I think the community perceives Pbomb libs ultras lurkers disruptors tanks zerg macro roach rava nydus and mech being bad as the primary concerns for balance I think blizzard perceives The PvZ matchup as the only problem that needs some help They didn t say they would nerf zerg or buff protoss but they want to help the matchup which means there s probably skewed from 50 50 win rates Lastly a lot of the community complaints are phrased pretty much like a tantrum People lose on ladder because they missed their splits and then run to the forums to make a statement in hopes that blizz fixes it instead of going back to the game and practicing airunit splits These posts dilute all of the good ones If idiots stopped mouthing off and thought constructively Blizz might be more open to discussing balance I m glad they do not pander to those that seek fixes from Blizzard especially at this point in the meta Ultras in my opinion are only a problem against bio terran I think protoss struggle a bit but immortals will always be a way to deal I think lings kinda destroy immortals tho so there might be need of something a bit stonger in hte air like a buff to voids but it s probably low priority compared to the zerg macro problem I think that if terran finds a way to defend against zergs early game then mech will find its way back into the matchup and ultras will become easier to deal with Libs with range are currently pretty decent against them Ghosts are okay but need to have maybe more than 1 hit before disrupting snipe Maybe like 2 3 The only change I can see for Pbomb is to make it non lethal That s the only way to allow it to continue to function in LOTV because if it doesn t zerg will surely get fucked in the air In my opinion everything else is fine Nydus is a huge complaint but I m pretty sure it is only that Libs are awesome fun and interesting in every matchup Disruptors just the same Roach rava is really strong but people will find a way
Early game is where Terran is strong against Zerg Ultras on their own are possible to just about deal with if you spot them coming and already have a good immortal count But it s Adrenal glands lings that are the issue with Hive tech Zerg vs Protoss 40 attack speed is too much of a buff 3 3 3 Zealots in a choke point get rekt by 3 3 adrenal glands lings cost for cost it s not even close Along with the brood lord issues which require colossi still even though they are god awful and invalidate disruptors in a big way The main issue with PvZ is that each thing Zerg can do got buffed considerably Roach ravager Hydra is a lot better than roach hydra Add in Lurkers to the mix and you need a huge commitment to Disruptors to deal with it at all Commiting to disruptors means you have very little AA s can t deal with the muta remax at all Z has so many different things that require an entirely different solution from Protoss It simply isn t possible to keep up with tech switches anymore due to the limitations of chronoboost and the new economy Liberators are an issue with TvP it s a lot harder to work around them than it should be and once they get range they can leapfrog and barely need any marines at all If you can t see that then I m not sure there s any point having a discussion with you
I would be totally fine if the ghost snipe resembled something like Nova s Triple Tap from Heroes of the Storm The zerg player hears the zzzzssttt sound effect hurriedly hits his hotkey to check his ultras and quickly moves the marked one out of range It has to be channeled it emits a very obvious warning sound effect and it paints the target Lots of counterplay right Right now I don t know how useful the drone thing is especially when all it takes is a single ling attack to disrupt it
They got rid of the drone the ghost ability looks like Nova s triple tap New ability Steady Targeting Deals 170 damage to a biological unit after channeling for 2 seconds Channeling is interrupted if the Ghost is takes damage or loses sight of its target Costs 50 energy There s a line like the widowmine so you can see which ultra is about to be hit There s no reason for a global warning because you shouldn t leave ultras or indeed your army unattended for any length of time that s the case with all the races
There is always going to be balance whining everyone thinks their race is underpowered in some way The only clear issue at the moment is zvp which they mentioned 5 days ago
You can t say he didn t cover the major balance issues when that s precisely what he did ZvP is a problem because of ravagers lurkers and less so ultras Liberators aren t really a balance issue TvZ but they are TvP in either matchup they make little sense design wise and it s pretty boring watching liberators leapfrog across the map
I d really like to know if they ve had a chance to read the great post on having an inject counter https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3u2qdy queuing inject larvae is great but can we please With over 500 up votes I hope they at least take a look at it
I honestly think they are about a week behind whenever they give these updates Whatever research they gather from community sites they probably pool it in a report and send it to higher management a la DK DK then processes it under his criteria and the types up one of these fine feedbacks for us to relish On the actual topic they may get to it in following weeks I think it would be a really nice Quality of life upgrade but at the same time I think there are other things in the priority list
Next week should be good as they will have tons of data from dreamhack
I really hope we get some good stuff from DH
i dont see how the tank drops are a problem they are fucking awesome to see why would you get rid of that let the meta find itself Ive already seen people going mass liberator mech and that is cool
Pack your toys Terrans we are supposed to deal with Roach Ravager and Nydus with Hellions I guess Also yay for deleting the only new gameplay change for Terrans in LotV
you should try making liberators they are a pretty good new unit terran got in lotvAs level 1 Cool will check out when I get out of this train thx
Well for some missions you need to be insanely cost efficient in brutal as level 1 So you need to know every wave and plan everything ahead of time And even then I d doubt it Would love to see a vod to admire the skill
Or just go mass wraith My level is too low for brutal but hard is ridiculously easy It would be cool to have a difficulty inbetween hard and brutal
Well what I mean is that ghosts can theoretically be quick and extremely cost efficient against ultras
Check out the Shoutcraft vods I wish they shared replays Personally I m playing a reactive style with shitty unoptimized builds so I can learn how the game works first
Theoretically ghosts are the best Snipe 2 shots the oversized beetles So you make 15 ghosts Now you need to 1 Deploy tanks 2 Pre split marines 3 Line up snipes 4 Not fuck anything up while your friendly neighbour is pretty much a moving On the beta I lost a game where I was 60 supply ahead because I messed up the army control Like I said it s like lategame tvp was in HotS So yeah I d say 15 or so libs with lots of marauders Don t know if you can get a good offensive engagement in a scenario where you re were behind initially though The switch sounds good but your production isn t as quick as the Zerg s production This post sounds very salty but I think tvz isn t a hard matchup simply because you can kill a zerg before lategame since your economy is better than in hots and Zerg hass less larvae to work with
Don t know how many barracks worth of reapers you mean For 2 rax proxied I m pretty sure it s holdable by pulling 4ish scvs to cover your marines until your factory is up It s fine to lose scvs your opponent will have no eco or tech After that follow it up with a marine hellion elevator and it s gg
I think it s situational if you feel like you ve got momentum and want to drop more do small trades for small trades medis are great because they make you units more cost efficient constantly then you should be making medis On the other hand imo if you lack momentum or you re not ahead it s better to go for libs after 3 4 medis so you will be stronger in big engagements Once the Protoss has a stable 4 base economy you should always be making libs so your army stays competitive
Fair enough Do you play on NA or EU
Master terran was masters in hots and on the lotv beta havent played enough to be masters in lotv Tvt Contrary to popular opinion I found it to be a lot of fun you re completely stretched on your multitasking ability doing all the usual macro stuff while constantly placing new spotters moving your army tactically etc Players with sick mechanics will be rewarded I like that The matchup seems like a ton of fun to me the randomness can be circumvented a bit by proper spotting and scouting and reacting quickly Tvp dunno have only played 2 protoss in my 20 games on the non beta edition so far Tvz I don t use libs as much as I should but don t really need them considering I m still chilling in plat Zerg has some nasty builds now but aside from that it seems like an easy matchup as long as you kill them before they get to ultras with a proper economy edit were you pastabrain on the lotv beta I think i had you on my friends list was named Bob on the beta
Holy crap 76 games already you ve been going HAM
Three people in my clan are masters already Just need 25 games to be promoted If you re an average master league player you won t get there in 25 games considering the calibre of players in plat dia though This is EU but see no reason why it would be different for NA
I think he completely misses the point haha
I wasn t talking about selecting buildings
Yeah I mean he s like methodical and efficient
Why no location hotkeys Why no shift queues to prevent idle scvs after they re done building
Nice took me a while to read but it was very worth it
This is pathetic man just leave him be put him on your ignore list This is like bullying a little kid
i ve tried unbinding it but now i just click it habitually i wish you could disable it
No they don t any calls on imbalance are purely anecdotal Blizzard know more but they re not transparent with their data
wow you weren t kidding
okay cool thanksGood Events like this are good for the health of the game and community They should raise the level cap though or offer additional portraits for like 1500 2000 wins especially for those of us who have been playing the last 5 years
This is very cool I love seeing those numbers
Too bad XP is completely and utterly useless for anything other than unlocking a few silly vanity portraits
You d be surprised what people care about One of the major Overwatch complains is a lack of progression or long term goals But yeah it s dumb
Maybe because in overwatch there is no goals outside of the game I mean they are no suprasegmental achievements goals whatsoever The problem with overwatch is that you are learning literally nothing for playing nothing can drop from you at the end of the match you don t get those virtual points currency and in the game you can t see your stats played it during Rtb2015 much better experience although point system is flawed in a way it was implemented before closed Beta there were some stupid ass multipliers for team kills yo ucould go on a 10 solo kill spree as an assassin adn you would be almost last on the scoreboard whereas a support sticking with the other guys together would be 1st 2nd very easily
I ve been playing OW non stop since Beta came out I d prefer it not have long term goals I think they re pointless and adding grinding into a game to unlock any gameplay affecting element of the game would absolutely kill it for me
Keep XP turned on It s a great tool to ensure you really did finish off that cloaked or burrowed unit
I feel like Co Op must have been designed with this in mind since even beating a mission on Hard with bonus objectives wont get you an upgrade later on This should make the grind actually bearable Though they desperately need to add more than 5 maps The boost for race levels will help casuals For hardcore people that already play all the time they are probably maxed I feel like they need some other form of progression for hardcore folks Probably something involving the Tournaments since I don t think trophies are that big a deal to keep people signing up long term with how frequent they are
Why not tournaments every hour as the normal thing They should make it so that you get more points during this week or during tournaments to encourage play
well you want tournaments spread out enough to ensure good matchmaking Increasing tournament frequency when their is more player activity works fine though
They would lose their value It s ok right now
I would propose more rarity Every 6 hours 4 times a day That leaves enough time for every time zone and work schedule to have access to at least one tournament each day You lost try again tomorrow puts a bit more emphasis on playing your best than you lost you get 3 more tries tonight If you want to play more than that that s what Ranked and Unranked is for isn t it
Why would they lose their value It d still be the same difficulty to win
So I ll ask you Would you watch IEM or DreamHack if it would be every week
Automated tournaments are not the same if I could enter a tournament every hour I would have a lot more freedom but the getting to play more wouldn t be bad if I could play tournaments only I would I don t see a reason to play ladder instead of tournaments unless you really need the time efficiency But I am Silver noob so take that as you wish
There is a middleground the developer should reach in order to match popularity for sure By making tournaments every 2 hours they are still accessible to everyone while they are rare enough that the game feature will still be interesting 6 months from now Shoving a tournament down our throat every hour is a perfect way to make them a boring gimmick down the road Blizzard did it perfectly by testing this out for a week long event a very rational choice IMO
I ve been out of the loop for a little while How many levels are there now per race in Lotv

Not as far I know 50hrs was just a guess
Still feeling it 4 days after finishing the campaign epilogue
Open to interpretation I myself prefer the happily ever after theory simply because we didn t wait 5 years to find out Jim drinks himself dead out of depression Kerrigan is a god dam Xel Naga it s hardly far fetched that she survived and was able to return Plus they both deserved something good after all the crap Sarah Jim went thru
Brought both so far enjoying both games but without being biased I have enjoyed LOTV more to the tune of 50hrs as opposed to FO4 at 11hrs
Yes a few things off the top of my head the lower the mileage the better PVC system health any clunks when turning at low speed usually is a good indication of suspension wear 4c struts are not cheap auto transmissions had a valve body problem on the early examples 03 05 model years worn clutch the fly wheel is dual mass and most shops won t touch it which means 800USD for a replacement cruise control operation if it doesn t work the clutch master cylinder is likely weeping requiring a replacement plus a new clutch position sensor 400USD for both Best thing to do with a potential purchase would be to have the car hooked up to VIDA aka Volvo dealer software as it will give a fairly decent outlook on the cars health Maintenance is key with the R if the previous owner was slack then you will pay for it This is sadly the case with my car however in my country I didn t have a better option as very few R s are on the roads here let alone manual ones

Is he retiring I know he was considering it earlier this year to move back to Korea and retire around this time P
He could be going into military service as well
i love requesting shitty music on his stream

I can t imagine trying to concentrate on playing SC2 while listening to those tunes
for money who gives a fuck
I m pretty sure he s got virtual audio cables installed so he doesn t have to listen to that shit
Pretty sure he does listen to it judging by wincing on some of the tracks visually
lol wtf why Poor Forgg
You know there s a word for what you do Sadism
i m actually quite submissive in bed
take it boy
which way are you trying to get me to roll
the dungeon master way
let me get my socks
May God rest ForGG s and your soul

mostly BMS but yeah a lot of this trash is on osu that s actually the main reason i quit people called this garbage J pop and legit enjoyed it i got so sick of it i left
Hey the second video is actually decent until halfway through though
This is you
Beautiful You re doing God s work
Interesting move Either personal reasons he is leaving Millenium and or he knows something about new WCS season we don t yet
He s going back because he has do to compulsory military service sometime next year
I hope they give him a position that takes advantage of his experience Like walling off the border harassing enemy command centers and setting up tank formations
gonna need someone else to make sure the wall is up though
wait you have to do military service in korea even if you re not even living inside korea o
If you are an able bodied male korean citizen you must do military service eventually If you move out of the country to avoid it you likely have to be ok with never going back as you will risk legal issues when you step foot back in Korea
Yeah I went to grad school with a guy who was from the US had dual citizenship and gave up his Korean citizenship so he wouldn t have to go back and serve
thats pretty crazy
Or you are a member of an important Chaebol clan I cant see the boys of the samsung ceo play in the mud
This made me wonder how players like Polt have put off military for so long According to liquipedia Polt is 27 Another would be Bomber who is nearly 30 iirc While Forgg for reference is only 25
Bomber is the same age as Polt I believe but yeah its weird they can go so long I assume for Polt its because he is studying in America but I m not sure why Bomber doesn t have to go
Polt will probably end up doing KATUSA which is where you do service for US army in Korea because you can speak good English It s more chill and you go home on weekends
Woah TIL Thanks for the info as a Polt fan I am pleased to hear he has that option
Polt completed his study two years ago if what I ve been told is correct
Bomber is also 27 not quite nearly 30
maybe harder region locking
If ForGG can t pass this harder region locking its 100 region locking since he Polt and viOLet are the epitome of players who live long term in their regions
deleted
I think you re a bit mistaken my friend Polt has lived a majority of his life in America for the past three years His primary residence is in Georgia and prior to that he was studying at the University of Texas He s lived here full time longer than any other Korean pro
deleted
Such as whom He has an American girlfriend lives in an American home eats in American restaurants and plays on the NA ladder The fact that he ll even ladder on NA is good for the scene What exactly do you expect him to contribute He s a serious progamer he s not going to show up to local LANs which I don t think there even are any in Atlanta He streams regularly He s nice to people and accessible to fans What more do you fucking want him to contribute Besides the folks at Basetrade folks like Lowko Feardragon and other similar people sorry for leaving many people out there aren t a whole lot of people contributing in a very public and open way People who play the game are friendly try their best and entertain sure contribute a heck of a lot more than most do I m not even personally a fan of Polt s but you re being ridiculous against him for no reason and you obviously don t have any facts to back up what you re saying
Not really he spend the first three months of 2015 in Korea thanks to Desrow for that info but has lived full time in US since He took a 4 day vacation to Korea before WCS and we know that from his streaming schedule
deleted
What StarDust doesn t play SC2 anymore he retired and like ForGG and viOLet he s lived in his respective country for years now Hydra has been here a year and if he stays as expected he obviously will be seen in the same light Polt along with ForGG and viOLet are the epitome of foreign Koreans ForGG will leave that group and Hydra will join it Just don t make stuff up about him living in the US for most of the year
Stardust lived in Europe somewhere for 2014 and moved to NA this year before retiring a long time spent in the foreign scene JD spent as long in the US as Polt this year and you re not giving him any credit at all Polt gets so much love for being Captain America because he waved a flag despite not knowing what it even meant or symbolised his words not mine
I think it s because the Korean government is fussy about them living outside Korea when they get to a certain age they don t like renewing passports and visas when you ve not done army duty yet Hopefully he keeps on playing it ll be a shame to lose him
sure hes a good guy and all but his country needs him to do the military service not such a shame imo hes had his time in bw and such i could think of 10 players it would actually be a shame to lose right now forgg not one of them
The only reason I think it d be a shame to lose anyone is sentimental attachment I like ForGG I enjoy watching him play so I think it d be a shame if he has to do army service now and would rather see him as a pro for longer My 10 would be Flash JD ForGG sOs Maru Inno SortOf MorroW Rogue and Keen sOs Maru and Inno are the only ones there who would have an impact on the game if they were to stop playing maybe Flash but I don t know how much of a draw in Korea he is now but it doesn t stop me from thinking it would be a shame to lose the others
yeah man i can understand that a lot i also love all the old school sc2 pros TOP Mvp Genius Squirtle leenock im kinda sad the current sc2 scene isnt what it used to be but thats just normal i guess people move on and times change just 2011 was a great time for me i ve always loved Keen too i saw him streaming a month ago or so and he has crazy mechanics im glad hes still around at least if only supernova could join sbenu aswell guess im just venting now
That s pretty surprizing
army maybe
I m guessing this might have something to do with it https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3itzj4 forgg to retire in october or november
Hopefully he will play GSL
Depends on what you mean He still has the chance to play at Blizzcon but he wont be playing against people in WCS America He will be playing in the GSLs and SSLs in order to get the chance to play at Blizzcon
I should write WCS Premier League Thx for fix
i think this is a good thing a majority of koreans that leave the country do it because they can t compete with fellow koreans and their skill starts to lower forgg has fallen in between being better than pretty much every foreigner but being a bit lower than most korean players hopefully moving back reverses this
Problem is Koreans start going to NA now
oh my goodness if this means we have a proper region lock in WCS I m gonna weep tears of joy Blizzard Entertainment s esports division saving esports EDIT Or it could just mean Millennium canned him for intentionally team killing during that one set of qualifiers this year
Yeah the ForGG rule just made another loophole for players like Hydra to exploit I say good riddance
What loophole Pro players are mostly fine with players moving to other regions playing on their ladders and contributing to their scene and winning What they re not okay with is them just flying over just for matches and dominating because they live in the region with the best available practice they want there to be an ecosystem
Army soon Boys No offense but ForGG has been playing for a long time and I don t see him achieving high level KR play anymore

Excellent negativity you have there m8The article was alright but Rob Zacny is a super good guy so it s nice to see him covering SC2 a bit
I wanted to share it with you folks because I really liked seeing SC2 s pro scene being covered in more mainstream game journalism
Yeah thanks Stopped reading PCG in the past year or so because I feel like it s really went down the drain in terms of quality but Zacny is the best strategy writer around Three Moves Ahead is a sick podcast and I love him on GWJ too
Wonder why he two sections on terran kekekekek

No cool down on cancel is stupid people will abuse it
If you have a cancel button you need to put a cool down other wise everyone will just shoot non stop until you get a good one and not cancel that one But half the cool down could make sense tho
Wasn t gameon the thing that catz created and that casted the enders game on bluray invitational
its not about money given its about being disappointed of not getting something you were so hyped for like if you are suppose to go on an epic vacation but get sick and cant go its nobody s fault but it still sucks Also i have been complaining to jakatak but its just because he is the face of it and they give him nothing to give us
well we have seen trailers for starnation 3 years ago and we still got nothing saying they are working on it doesn t mean shit these days

All 3 parts are standalone you do not need any of the others to play You buy wol to get the Terran campaign heart of the swarm for the zero campaign and legacy of the void for the Protoss one Other than that the multilayer on legacy has more features so if you want to get the game for multiplayer I suggest lotv You can play with your friends as long as they have the starter edition which is free
The only way is to turn the graphics down but even then they will still be there just uglier
He has litteraly dozens of dollars
I think it s safe to say that overall he s been the best Armada as always been a solid contender but mango when he turns it on he turns it on
Nope you don t need the other 2 legacy is standalone go have fun

Your need to contact me for a pointless comment tops it I do believe
Know nothing about What is there to know about a hillbilly wanting to feel big and powerful over a creature who isn t able to fight back You re more of an animal than them If only you could be put into their situation and have a blood thirsty beast like yourself hunting them down in cold blood You deserve bad luck to follow you around Perhaps your foul offspring will get to attached to preying on animals and taking lives and turn on other people as foul as you You might see some error in your ways then Typical Americans I spit on you Here s to hoping for you to experience their pain and fear one day God bless that you scum bag
Oh wow I didn t think about this Thanks mate it crossed my mind as to how I would know if they re upgrading and how far they ve already done Appreciate this
Think you re getting confused here pal Integral92 is his channel name and in game name that i saw gl finding whoever you re looking for
Aw yeah that ll be useful Thanks man So many minor adjustments can have a huge impact
Dunno if that s his name or what Integral was his twitch channel name I ve seen him online around 2am London time but as he s living down under who knows what his schedule might be Good luck man
It has absolutely no impact at all Your words not mine x
Tab does allow you to cycle through the units so you can use the compilation of hot keyed abilities Think it s pretty reasonable to assume it worked in conjunction with alt grouping But hey I m wrong Now people will see this as well and know now to rely on that false tip My bad But tab does do something so we re both wrong in one way or another
No it s a guy called integral92 Plays Zerg and makes an effort to give viewers tips and whatever questions I ask
It cycles through the separate units If it doesn t allow you to split them into groups like that and only use the units abilities then correct me if I m wrong so I can delete that bit of the comment I only just found out about the alt grouping hot key from this post so I assumed it worked with it If not ignore that bit P

That s what I thought Nothing you could think of that would defend your actions Hi I m an inbred red neck My Hobbies and interests include killing defenceless animals without giving them a chance in hell and raising my also inbred red neck children to do the same thing Ahyuk yuk Hopefully a tragic hunting accident befalls you and then you might realise not to be such a cunt when there s a bullet lodged in your innards Merry fucking Christmas you piece of filth
Also pressing tab whilst selecting multiple units all let you cycle through the different types of units to quickly set this up and or use the abilities of the units
Well amidst the chaos in the next episode I m sure he ll show his hand
Plot twist Like Did you not think he was going to come and do something malicious at some point If there s one thing the writers of this show are and that s unsubtle They ve shoved it into our face since the start of the season whilst believing they have us fooled Same goes for Glenn s story
I d never heard of those words before I moved to Springfield
And you realise you go around putting a hole in an animals body ending its life without a fighting chance Coward And your children will most likely grow up like you Disgusting
Ah a self confessed hunter You are a disgusting human being There is nothing doesn t about you at all and you should be ashamed of yourself I d spit in your face if I were with you in person Nothing more than a psychotic child that wants to feel like they have power when in reality you re just a bully with a gun Let s hope you befall some sort of hunting accident so that other more important lives may continue Go fuck yourself you gun toting redneck
It s just how the story ended was funny in a odd way I m with you on that I love playing Zerg The looks how you get your army out The building animations All of it PI disagree Lots of blood D

So is it the Ro16 tomorrow and the rest during blizzcon Is there anything occurring on the weekdays
the soccer ball deflection was beautiful
This is a very special image haha
Back in my day we had fast food lunches and then we played in a field so none of us became fat Bring something with fibre so you can poop fine and then eat the other two meals of the day at homei m still pissed because the user not in your realm bug has existed for five years and with the new way friends lists work i can t check the profiles of people or people sending a friend request to remove the realm bug on someone s profile you would add them as a friend now you can t do that lol
deleted
to avoid sniping you have to accept a friend request for them to appear online so you can t add them to your friends list to get past the realm bug anymore assuming they have no idea who you are and choose not to accept
You get friend requests O
You don t Try to remove some of your current friends that have been offline for a long while when you are at 200 friends you can no longer receive or send new friend requests that might fix your problem
Blizz hasn t fixed from WoLMy pleasure
No problem I also find it really helpful when you need to split up your army when you get dropped in multiple locations Or when you want to set up a flank
Do you just teleport to your enemies when using VATS with melee This looks weird without actually seeing your character move to the targets
Reminds me of Wolverine vs Thanos
Thanks for all the replies guys It s pretty late and i just got home so will read them tomorrow morning
I would save around 40 42 but lose 400MHz Do you think there would be a noticable drop in performance Because if there is i would rather pay the extra 40 42 and have a slightly better system edit I wanted to but i didn t because i couldn t find all my components there I have to get to work in 15 minutes but i will make a pcpartpicker link once i m back home
Thanks for the fast reply It s still downloading but i will have fun once it is finished definitely D glgl for you too
If it isn t gone in 3 days i would definitely see a doctor
LotV servers are down
Is this Don Cheadle
Thank you i hardly use the cube only to get passives from legendarys Do you mean upgrade rare to legendary I ll try that I think i have a few hundred death breath already
Yes i m playing the lvl 22 greater rift now i think it s the equivalent of T5
I think i have all the gems then because i haven t had a gem drop in a long time I really want to play right now but today is reserved for my girl Shame she doesn t play or we could clear rifts together A man can dream D Thanks again
Do you mean gems instead of rings I find more legendary sets when i do normal rifts but i thought greater rifts would drop more But thanks for the fast reply
I don t play LotV yet but i noticed something like this since after the 3 0 patch I feel like sometimes i have to wait a little bit to give another command For example when i want to build 2 extractors at once sometimes only 1 drone builds an extractor even though i m pretty sure i gave 2 commands i m not using shift click to build i give 2 seperate orders This never happened to me before the new patch
Alright thank you edit I just tested it and it worked Thanks again
Thank you I wanted to start a new season char
This may be a stupid question but could i do bounties on T1 and collect all the caches and then switch to T10 and open the caches so they will drop T10 items Is there a difference between T1 and T10 items
I m lvl 70 now and now i see the keyssweeeeet a game thats actually worth following
EffOrt vs July hype
Clearly I m well out of the loop July went back to BW I thought he retired or was doing his military service
He finished his military service and is playing Brood War again https www youtube com watch v Pivxx3A1efUWell done I really need to play this mode
Holy shit gratz How long did that take
and portraits are still low qualityI watched Crank and MMA yesterday and a little of Crank and True today I ve got to say Crank is one of the best streamers out there Hes so funny polite high energy and interacts with his chat really well in English He even translates for his audience which I thought was terrific Definitely looking forward to his next archon games next week
I was watching the other night and he was randomly choosing people from chat to dictate what strategy he would play in the next game Saw some hilarious stuff he was clearly having a good time and chat was loving it My favourite Korean streamer for sure
Hah my friend and I played our first ever archon game this afternoon and got matched up against Crank and True It went as well as could be expected
Sick guyshaha thank you
Hey don t thank me thank Jaedong
Its just a single build worth a try Not saying it is the only way to play
Np It is such a good build I have 80 wr with it right now and the cool part is that you can choose to back off and you will be ahead or just be even with your opponent
Yup I am aware Last ones have gotten at least 30 views so Apparently there some people out there entertained simply by the gameplay And in all honestly the gameplay is pretty beautiful allied commander does a great job of creating some great eye candy moments
Thanks for the feedback will for sure make a change with the audio software
Thanks for the feedback Will try to work on that in the future
Hey my first video ever will definitely fix the chair squeaking and also will use my own footage in the future
Yup there is for sure For instance against 3CC when you kill every SCV and they stop you with a banshee all you need to do is do 7 queen roach with nydus follow up auto win anything else is giving them more of a chance to get back into the game imo
Even as a zerg that was simply great play from SoS hats off to him
And this is why I didn t include Lilbow in the strawpoll for who will win Blizzcon didn t even prep for Blizzcon lol
And this is why I didn t include Lilbow in the strawpoll for who will win WCS

This update is so confusing to me

this is bad even for a shit post
SO FUNNY FULLKEK IM ALSO 11 YO
Eh I laughed
you must be 11 then
He s actually 7 but very mature for his age
thank you my mom is very proud of me
Silly I know but it made me laughBeen pretty much watching state 24 7 since he got back into streaming He does as lot of replay releases it seems Probably one of my favorite streamers atm
If this is legit and approved by State it s incredible How did you get these If this hasn t been approved by State I would remove it asap fingers crossed State s cool with it Edit It s legit Hallelujah
State posted it on twitter
Thanks
Awesome thanks for posting and thanks to State I ve been struggling vs Zerg real bad lately
So I went through all the PvZ reps already and starting to go through some PvT replays So far the build I got from PvZ is 14 Pylon scout 17 Nexus 17 gateway 18 gas 2 probes 19 gas 1 probe saturate to 3 for both after 16 16 minerals 100 gateway Core 25 Pylon Stalker WG 150 gas citadel forge And then go from there Seemed to be the base build he went for and then deviated as needed For PvT what seemed to be the go to so far have only looked at 4 5 replays 14 pylon 16 gate 16 gas 1 on gas add more once saturated 19 nexus scout with probe 100 gate core 21 pylon 70 core 2nd gas 100 core WG adept keep making 4th should pop once warp prism is finished 100 nexus robo 50 robo Citadel 100 citadel DT shrine 2 gates resonating glaives 100 wrap prism 2 gas And that seemed to be his base go to so far Hope this helps anyone who is curious how to break down a replay or whatever 3 3 gl gl
It s a twilight council
My god i was looking for some ideas in PvZ I nearly got cancer just by watching zerg doing drops This matchup is ridiculous
Just to let people know he takes down replay packs when he starts streaming the next day as they are part of his donation incentive So grab them fast
Thank you so much for this I love states playstyle and really wanted some lotv replays
Is it the proState
State The same guy who failed to break Proleague
Theres some good terran openings in here too
It doesn t work I can t make them work in sc2I have weird fans
Add snarky eyes We know what you meanI love this thanks for the work I will try out your build
Fan fucking tastic ZvT has been giving me loads of trouble and this guide looks perfect Unfortunately I m out of town and away from my gaming computer for the weekend I m saving this and will be using the heck out of it when I get backWhy would someone trade a 55 controller for a 30 game

I wonder how many people that upvoted this gets the reference
Wow that gun is massive
The anti apple circlejerk graces r gaming today
I mean they pretty much had to but I was really happy they gave some sort of explanation for the Tal darim With every single mission that involved them in the previous games I was pretty frustrated it just seemed to be a filler enemy since despite how many missions they are involved in you knew nothing about them except they are evil protoss It also bugged me because I really like the way they let you play as the bad guy factions in SC1 UED Kerrigan Overmind and it wasn t great how they made everyone you play with a hero in SC2 and having such a prominent enemy with unknown motivation was definitely a large part of why the story seemed like a one dimensional good vs evil story
That s understandable The reviews and half the price was enough for me to take the risk and I am a pretty big fan of what I received

No a hole is not made of atoms There can also be holes in gasses like to o zone layer A hole is simply an area where things are less dense than the surrounding area Holes are an indication of less matter aka less atoms

They show it as hitting the national news and getting millions of view why would you doubt that it went viral
There are so few players playing you are almost always going to be playing top 8 players regardless of what league they are in Last week I got masters for the first time in a year and a half or so I think it is easier to get masters this season that it has been in past seasons I played a total of 3 GMs before I got promoted so few players they were matching a player who was still in diamond against GM I was promoted shortly after spending down my bonus pool so probably about 200 games
He also sprouts a 5 O clock shadow out of no where
Wow holy shit only 0 01 of people in the US are allergic to peanuts this mom is an idiot why is that everyone else s problem After the very least get people on board with referencing candy that doesn t suck balls smarties necco wafers I think you are turning people off from your message

Wow remember when this was political suicide in the GOP You know what ever happened to the 99 of the professionals in that area of research are completely abandoning the concept of science and are just doing it for the increase funding
Yeah I had thought about that when I originally thought about it As it is right now there is no diversity so it would be an improvement there It would be a sweet bonus for lower level players to climb the ladder diamond and masters less mobility players are pretty screwed and will always see the same units The more I am thinking about it loading a large amount of 3d models is probably pretty bad for a loading screen I guess this was a good add simply because the models are already pre loaded from the general multi player screen
I like it It would be cool if it changed with the respective leagues with masters or grandmasters being the heroes
oops you On a side note he is clearly loving the costumeI mean she is hot so I dont mind But this uuh sexy time pose just doesnt fit Okay it fits to the SC II sexy time Kerrigan but as some objekt in my room a bad ass I am the Swarm Kerrigan would be much better then killing Amon Chill Kerrigan
I agree But it s a sick looking statue regardless lol
I agree with this sentiment I am the Swarm Kerrigan is badass but owning this Sexy Time Kerrigan would just make me feel like a pervert Especially misleading with the box art
I can t see her heels
Here ya go
I really like it looks awesome and I think the femme fatale pose is badass Is this the one that is like 25 inches tall too Must be huge hard to tell without scale Also where d you pre order it from Looking online seems pretty expensive
Pre ordered it from Sideshow Collectibles It s currently Waitlisted It was a bit pricey but totally worth it in hand
if the face wasn t so weirdly pale white like that it would be much more awesome but cool
The lighting throws it off a little It s a light green Real light lol EDIT Here s a picFix for the Tank issue Introduce an upgrade with Armory requirement that lowers the siege time to 1 5 seconds That way one of the coolest additions of LotV stays in the game and it restores the importance of positioning in TvT because even if unsieged the better positioned player will get the first volley off Also it would make the Tank more viable vT P and potentially serve as an alternative to Liberators
That s pretty surprizing
Holy fuck I feel for you man This would drive me fucking insane
Fairly sure this is not a network issue I ve had a very similar problem a couple of years ago with my old laptop My GPU was broken damaged by overheating Here s what was happening for me I played the game My GPU was overheating and shut off Screen froze for a split second while the integrated Intel HD GPU took over GPU cooled down Screen froze while GPU took over again GPU overheated etc So what I m saying try to disable your GPU and see if that fixes it If so your GPU is the issue Hope that helps
Yeah you re right I wanted to the answers to be good responses to DKs thoughts but I fucked up in that regard
In Masters this was my experience for the first week but now Zergs got pretty good at stalling with Ravager Corruptor for Hive tech at which point I m the one who needs to adapt
Interesting thanks
If 5 years of SC2 taught us anything it s that free units are always a bad thing
So you got to Plat while only injecting 1 Hatch No wonder Tumescent also made it to Diamond
Based Morrows custom stuff is always great Marine Control has been my go to warm up for ages now
I don t think you ve replied to the right thread
I really like Liberator vs Disruptor fights right now Certainly better than Bio Ghost Viking vs Deathball
There are coins with higher values in other countries
If anything people would go back to BW but that also won t happen
Thanks
So that Toss players get forced into Colo armies every game again Nah They are in a good place right now they are still strong but not so strong that building anything else is stupidI don t actually deserve to be Diamond but the only matchup I m good at happens to be over 50 of my games P
Good for you really Seems like Zerg is the current overpowred race so if they re your best match ups you re in great shape until the next need patches
lol im so bad vZ
Find an all in that works I have like a 65 PvZ by doing a 7 gate Warp prism all in
lmfao 10 10Bless you for trying
I see now
I didn t have a pitchfork
I figured it would take them a while A year is actually less time than I thought I just thought they d add a unit every month or so like they did with the roach stalker marauder update
I know it exists I ve played it too It just hasn t been updated since they added the marauders roaches and stalkers That was 6 months ago
I suppose I was just under the impression that a new unit for each race would be added every once in a while
3 days ago So he s still animating apparently but the mod hasn t been updated in 6 months
Moved up north of what South of what How are we supposed to know these things

Yeah even though I play Roach Hydra in ZvT I probably wouldn t use this opener specifically I use the pool first into 4 sneaky lings strategy but I could imagine this build being great versus Protoss and since I m struggling with early game aggression versus Protoss with my current build I think I ll start giving this one a whirl again thanks for replying much appriciated
Hey man sorry for replying at a late time but I was just checking reddit before heading to bed when I got into platinum league and I didn t know any builds your easy build order carried me into high diamond almost immediately after using it http imgur com X8gewoH still got it written down from 1 5 years ago now being a mid master just wondering how this build fares at a higher level could I re learn and still use this as it is or are there any changes I should make to things like gas timings etc If you answer this It s much appriciated

Worms armageddon The game never gets old Problem is a lack of people to play with the AI a mix of complete dead precision can lob a grenade across the map and land it in your 1 2 cm hiding hole and completely inept will only use said grenade for several turns in a row to show off no doubt but still crazy fun to mess around
It s a grief thing Its very irritating but we swallowed it because we knew where it came from to some extent For instance telling a stroke patient there is nothing more that can be done the situation unlikely to improve and we have to wait A lifetime of TV and the media makes them think there are all forms of options but we just don t know them or aren t able to do them Same thing for malignancies or severe autoimmune problems when we talk about palliation or control They get angry or frustrated Other times its speed After 10 days of care some people and their loved ones will get downright nasty as to the lack of progress or slow progress This is also understandable due to possible mounting bills and prolonged emotional stress Then sometimes we just have downright cunts
honestly radio would have been a good choice for me if the job market was available Radios are an envy among us mostly only office hours minimal night shifts and if night shifts almost no work comparable pay the problem is that we need like 20 other physicians for every 1 radio we get and most hospitals around here saturated with radio while still actively seeking the other specializations
neither was i i think i was mostly called hey you
This is so perfect and painful because it hits close to home I feel guilty now If I drop by the radiology dept its always for a report and nothing else it was a long standing hospital inside joke for all physicians
We were actually called resident physicians Some patients used it as a derogatory term Some would say things like what do you know you are only a resident or can I get a real specialist Not even kidding
Was on one of those car carrying ships as a kid standing on the deck alone adults were inside as this whole premise bored them Was enjoying standing against the wind as I had never felt wind that strong At one point the wind was so powerful I could not push against it with all my might It was frightening and I was getting a bit panicked At one point for a brief instant it actually took me off my feet I ran in Learned to respect nature that day and realized how insignificant o can be to even this mild display of mother nature s power

Is this really doing a lot of good I mean I can t fully be judgemental as the group is doing 99 more than the rest of us but how much of an impact is this having Yes it bars them reaching people but of the people they reach how many are actually out to join up And of those who do how many were going to join up anyway If people were dedicated to join I don t think they would be dissuaded by seeing their twitter it forum go down They would seek other active ones The group I m sure is also creating new accounts and migrating forums On top of that I m not sure how much this group puts weight on using social media go begin with I m imagining something like deleting all social media against McDonalds to curb obesity It may have some impact but not much Lastly they aren t mentioning how its being done Really the bulk of these attacks seem like scripts to detect keywords and spam reporting which isn t the cyberwar the media touts Call me a cynic but it really seems like all this positive press for anon is not so much for their victories but to show the public that groups are rising up and trying to doing something about it to give people hope Like all these TILs about how cancer cures are found daily The news makes the public feel better but a closer look shows that we are quite a bit away from any good progress

I will try to have it on a different drive than an ssd maybe my ssd is not working properly even though it only manifests in sc2 Thanks
As I explained I already turned everything off which is security related and it did not help thanks for the advice though
I am playing on EU but I will try it I will leave winmtr net running in an hour to check for stuff thank you
I will try that thank you Edit Tryed and did not work sorry Edit2 It DOES NOT happen in offline mode so it must be internet related
Yeah it is that is why I am writing here
It does happen on other servers I will check offline mode when I am done streaming I did not transfer anything except my harddrives They are fine though as far as I can see I checked them with the usual tools and as SC2 is on a SSD anyways it should not be a problem Other than that I changed everything
So the thing is theoretically speaking I do not think that it is hardware related as I had this problem beforehand and I upgraded evevery single piece of Hardware 2 years ago and my Card is not overheating or anything like that checked temps AND it is not happening in any other game I do not even have problems in other games which are graphically a lot more demanding than SC2 I changed all network hardware stuff so there is that I did a clean install of Windows 10 happened on Win7 as well and did multiple clean installs of win7 as well so it is not really software related My Internet is fine acording to all sources Blizzard my Internet Provied I even talkte to EA about another issue and asked them about this one etc eveything is fine I have no problems in other games yeah Thanks for trying though appreacite the effort
well it was possible for zerg to tech to hive in hots too You cannot prevent that but you can force it so zerg does not have a huge bank for 3 upgrades 3 3 and crack and ultras etc and that is all it takes I think It is still really hard for terran once zerg has ultras available but I think someone will figure it out eventually
It is still the same mostly like in hots in terms of general gameplan Get a relatively greedy build maybe even with a quick 3rd cc once you ruled out the ravanger roach allin And then you go out with your first 2 medivacs deny creep and make him fight for a forth base If you can limit him on 3 bases for a while which happens to me more often than in lotv as timings are not refinied yet thats great Get your 4th base up and try to be equal with zerg in bases If you are ahead in bases you will eventually win The Mid Lategame is similar to hots
Liberators Lots of them and then you need to manually target the ultras Normally though if he gets a lot of ultras there were mistakes made in the arly or mid game and his economy was way stronger because of that
I play terran because splitting for what feels like perfectly is just the best feeling in the world Also love that buildings can fly
Yeah it s really interesting but I do not see any other reliable way to stop a nydus In Hots you died to a nydus too if you did hellion builds You survived by killing it before it was done which is now impossible I think you could cc first or 1 rax fe into 2 reapers afterwards for scouting but unless the nydus gets nerved I think that 1 1 1 openings are really hard to do against nydus Maybe with liberators if you can set them up quickly enough and focus the nyds hmmm
I never saw such a play but I guess reactored liberators will do
Nice writeup Thx The nydus worm is the sole reason i tried to go cc first into 3rax as the dps of hellion oppenings seemed to low to kill it if queens went out first It works easily Normally you do die against a ling baneling bust cause of the lack of hellions but I survived one pretty easily with just stim against a GM yesterday Maybe the eco advantage and faster production for terran and a little bit lessened production for zerg makes this bio play actually viable as you have enough stuff to hold zergs bust I think with 2 3 bunkers it is autowin anyways Not sure though just a thought
I have to say this is so emotional manipulation and the arguments are really really weak This really get s to me when nothing else get s to me You know like Top decks don t get to me Losses are natural Like losing a family member that is natural I worked so hard on HearthArena that Natasha almost broke up with me Also if this would have been a 3 man startup like he claims then the risks and money needed should have been shared equally The list goes on and on Way to go
Let s discuss priest here I will experiment with Jeweled Scarab for sure just because it is a 2 drop and the priest card is again not in the first week Otherweise I do not think there is much to get for priest here what do you all think Maybe I am totally wrongBomber TY PartinG Solar Who comes in the lower Bracket Who cares
I like parting and solar because of their inherent skill advantage I don t know why but I think firecake advances out of his group Bomber would probably be the favourite but firecake likes to abuse things and I think he can pull it off Group D is tough No idea on that one Probably TY but anyone can win i thinkI ll check it out Thanks man
It s all in the lips with Harstem

Hey John John huge fan of all of your videos can t wait to see View From A Blue Moon Recently I went to the exhibition of Bernard Testemale for his work Big waves rider of Hawa All of the pictures were incredible but yours was specially above the other I was disappointed that I couldn t get my hands on one of them though Was that a request on your side or just Bernard that didn t wanted to sell yours Can I still get one
Sounds perfect to me Good job
That was some Motley Crue drumming skills you got there Impressive On a side note I can t wait to get my hands on this As a drummer I would simply build the SICKEST set of drums and cymbals Mike Portnoy style jamming like a madman without going bankrupt on the first pair of cymbals

Pretty chilled so far got back to work after a 2 weeks holidays gone surfing most of the time But it has to stop Now it s serious business once again 8 to 6 and then my usual 2 hours of CSGO fix in the evening GLHF

Are you talking about this one
I haven t watched TV this month but I heard something sad happened to Paris Hilton
That s healthy af tho
Shame probes didnt walk into banes
They did
Also you can click on probe while on Spear
There are quite a lot of them in the mission were Purifiers help you
The only Protoss unit that isn t there is Instigator I think and some normal units with skins like Tal darim archon which is normal archon but looks exactly the same as Dark archon
Also she was a scum in WoL and HotS
Things like that happen in LotV too when you play campaign 2nd time and press restart mission I think LotV patch broke something in all campaigns If you want to continue playing with that save just find autosave from that mission and load it They are named mission name checkpoint number like Outbreak 3
If it s bulletproof glass you can call it foursome mirror
Playing pirate map is like playing Hearthstone The more you pay the bigger chances of victory
Yes but you don t get their Spear powers
Only you I think Did you lose connection during the missiion
By playing Tower Defense with a tight way and 6 big cannons at every entrance
So are DLC On one hand more campaign On the other hand less money
To let you check how many times your opponent can get 12 pooled before he learns
I don t think you can get Void Rays here I did this with putting cannons at every entrance and putting 1 shield battery near every cannon to make a wall it makes zerglings Ultralisks walk like it s Tower Defense Also take Photon Overcharge and spam Nexuses EVERYWHERE at the end so Zerg will have to destroy them
They are bugged for everyone I clicked restart mission today and got stalkers without blink and DT without revive masacreI m zerg and the other guy was terran that s the funny part
sorry I meant to say the problem with viewing professional starcraft
Impossible Nishikori will reign
It s a new feature
No it s cool when they come up with new LoTV cheeses but when you re doing 4 gate blink stalker and 14 14 baneling busts and proxy 2 raxes it s so fucking irritating They installed 5 gb just to fucking cheese people who are actually trying to test stuff out it s unranked so it doesn t even matter if they win or not I don t understand the rationale behind these people You get like 3 of these games and most people will just be like fuck it and play a different game Happened to Fenner on stream then he played CSGO the rest of the day
I RUV YOU
I mean it s not like the starcraft crowd right now couldn t use a bit more hype and cheering
those devs are probably all on HoTS now kappa
Can someone tell me why it was removed
Not to be rude or anything but in 2014 there weren t many awesome epic plays that were 1 2 minutes long Not to mention the commentators who never hype up anything these days There were a lot like a lot of amazing games but you can t have a 10 hour highlight video P S sorry lolOh wow Honestly I thought I was going to play on High or even medium Thanks for the help
Yeah That s why SC2 is one of the best games to date
I also have a Dog for my transportation
Can someone ELI5 this
Sadly yes
I could only imagine that underground is worst
That happened to me Back in High school we had a A Program Which is helping Kids with school I was waiting for my ride School got out and almost every single Kindergarten I was a superhero to them waved or smiled at me But one came up to me and gave me a hug and ran off The parent next to me started to smiled at me That little kid made my day I didn t even knew that kid
They want to keep technology for themselves Plus they just came to the Commonwealth and act like they own it
I joined the Institute and WOW That final mission Hell broke lose I couldn t side with the Brother Hood Thugs They sound like they want to control everything and keep things all for them Shaun on the other hide felt like my dad instead of my son At first before founding out that my son is the leader i hated the Institute But after learning more about them I started to realize that they could save the Commonwealth
He s probably one of those people who says FIRST on every youtube comment section
Thanks for telling this deal I Might be interested in buying this instead of the dell
Probably under 950
I heard Newegg isn t a great place to buy comptures That laptop looks good for the price but worried about Newegg
Thanks I was leaning towards the dell too My only issue was the i5 instead of the i7 But that shouldn t matter
They only had money for an artist
I have a problem that every time I save it gets corrupted Lucky it autosaves
So do Obama Speak Russian or Putin speak English
Even though I m not French I still get goosebumpsIt s the percent you play that game mode
Oh right yeah that explains it Thanks
percentage of games played in this mode Maybe its percentage of wins in this mode
correct
Yeah it s the first one Can t be the percentage of wins my 6 9 archon winrate would fill it much more than it does if that were the case Thanks
Percentage of games played per gametype All the bars should equal to one full barThanks
will do once my download is done thank you so much
sweet I will check it out when the download is done
Ah thanks assume its pretty dead for only HotS then ahah
These last two days of the high plat low diamond soloq has been honestly some the worst soloq I have ever had to experience 0 10
HAhahaha I m matched with these two also
Aahahahah that actually made me laugh thank you
Might be mad and toxic to get banned earlier in the year doesn t mean I am not fine now Not everyone can physically control their emotions the same as everyone else
yolo
awesome thank you
thanks
Any where from 75 150 if possible

surprised this got down voted so much seems harsh
https twitter com LiquidRetI dont like how they divided air and ground Mech upgrades again personally
That a reference to nerfs
Those are thousands of learning and experience that improve the overall efficiency of the people involved Those are never lost
Your ship will start to shake and you ll get a warning if you continue your ship get s destroyed However this is just a temporary thing for the PTU won t be like this in the PU
Terran cause blowing up aliens in the good old human fashion with heavy tanks and huge guns and ex criminals in armored suits is just the way to go That and the Banshee pilot is hot On a more serious note I really like most of the Terran Units and the way they play In terms of my playstyle and what I feel comfortable Zerg would fit me better since I m more the reactionary type but I guess I have to get out of my comfort zone once in a while and it s a necessary sacrifice since I don t like any of the Zergs units or their aesthetics
Well that s a charming way of asking something you apparently know nothing about As explained what you ve seen is the Persistent Test Universe a test server where people can go to test the more unstable builds and help with discovering problems What is going on right now is that the Alpha 2 0 has been released to 15000 people on the PTU and it s highly unstable Those people that play it are dedicated to the development and endure those crashes to help The live server where the stable build is on can be played by anyone who has a game package and a ship It doesn t run so well since optimisation is low on the priority list for any game and this is still in Alpha but it s very stable and playable
I actually have no idea what they re gonna do with hangars in the PU They seem so ridiculously large and a waste of space that realistically you d need to spend a lot of money to maintain them And I d rather park my ship in some dark secure bunker and live in a fancy suit in the hotel across the street than have a super fancy hangar for a ship I d rather fly than look at
No having certain functionalities locked behind a pay wall so to speak would not be very smart Hangars are just there to reflect the amount of money you contributed to the development You get the fancy Revel York because you ve contributed a fancy amount They just differ in aesthetics for now
They look different
Is there any advantage to buying a ship concept during anniversary sale Concept sales include LTI but reoccuring sales for concepts do not so is there any advantage I m very interest in the Sabre however it s a bit expensive and I d have to melt my package for it which would result in me losing access to the game until I can afford a package again Once the Sabre becomes flight ready will it be available for purchase as a package like the other flight ready ships
I liked the tutorial what s wrong about it
Another answer to what I think you re asking There is no seamless transition between your hangar and 2 0 yet We don t even know where are hangar is located at this point so the elevator is basically a magical teleporter for now
THANKS GUYS YOU RE ACTUALLY KEEPING MY HYPE AND ENVY IN CHECK WITH ALL OF THESE REPORTS OF NON FUNCTIONALITY
The goal of the game is whatever you make your goal Whether it be to own all small ships own a capital ship raise your Organisation or yourself to glory explore every corner of the galaxy and so forth Whoever can t handle that kind of freedom won t be happy with Star Citizen This is an MMO a massive multiplayer online game not an MMORPG with dragons and classes and levels and shiny golden daggers that one hit said dragons cause they re super magical
This is about exactly what Chris Robert wants to avoid and therefore Star Citizen will not be
What are the best energy weapons for S2 and S1 right now Got some rec to spend and I want to spend it wisely but I have not been keeping up with that and I don t go well with ballistic weapons as they have ammunition and I usually waste a lot of that trying to hit something
6AM for Central EU That s a bit unfair in my opinion
Miles ahead of you Whenever I see a video from Star Citizen show up on my feed I click on it and am already naked when it starts
Yeah If only I knew how to do that D My video editing and photoshop skills are very basic The UEE vs SPQR Picture was made in Paint
A Sabre and a Vanguard I m in an organisation that aims to be the most prominent private military that people call when they need fire support so my Sabre will be the short range quick response Fighter and the Vanguard my patrol and escort ship Depending on how expensive the Sabre or Vanguard are going to be during the sale I ll most likely melt my Tali for it I just wish the Scimitar had come through it s such a sexy ship
I was playing Rush on Golmud Rail and said The first base is cancer without tanks and I was immediately kicked and perma banned Was my first time on that server Evidently my last too
Yeah I really hope they bring in story events that really have an impact on the gameplay not just this happened while you were sitting in ArcCorp sort of thing explained in a short story on the website like World of Warcraft does it Which is a pretty shitty and lazy way of doing it
Thanks but you know complimenting the visuals in a video that is mostly about the voice audio kinda sends a message DHe had nothing to do with it haha
I love it it s the most fun I ve had in a match up in a long time
I don t know who you talk to but I know a lot of Protosses that struggle in PvT in LotV a LOT I m even a prime example 70 in PvP and PvZ and 36 in PvT I think you re just pulling shit out of your ass
If the match up is so balanced why are there more terrans than Protoss in every league except Gold and under In fact Silver has 2x more Protoss than Terran and Diamond has 50 more Terrans than Protoss If PvT was so easy for the Protoss there would be a higher concentration of Protosses in the higher leagues with a lower concentration of Protoss in the lower leagues
SC2Gears or SCELight SCELight is literally just a more updated version of SC2Gears and I don t believe SC2Gears receives any more updates I could be mistaken
I ve seen Master players stream lose to legit HotS Gold and Platinum Zergs No matter what this shouldn t happen because of the mechanics difference but I guess you re going to make up an excuse for that one too
I ll also point out that once I unlocked the additional Blink upgrades from Vorazun Blink became B again and it ignores the fact that my Stalkers are bound to O using PRM 2 0 I have a feeling this is because it changes Blink to another spell called Blink that has the 40 shield regeneration but that spell isn t re bindable
I can t get specific hotkey suggestions since I m unfamiliar with RRM 2 0 but what I can suggest is the fact that both of your new units are morphed versions of previous units So you can use whatever hotkey morphing from ling to bane or from corruptor to BL on the roach and Hydra for the Ravager and Lurker respectively For the Lurker Den you can use the same hotkey you would use from Hatch Lair or from Spire Greater spire Then with Hold Fire from Lurker I m not entirely sure what would be best but Corrosive Bile and whatever the Corruptor spell is called should probably be one of your default spell hotkeys like whatever Fungal Growth is Hope this helps D EDIT Emotes hate me
It s a glitch that sometimes happens when you get placed or rank up It basically just means you have 3 bonus pool ignore the negative sign
I think you feel too entitled to his time He gave his reasons why he wasn t doing SC2 content and they were valid reasons I don t clamor for Day9 Acting like he is a horrible person for stopping SC2 content and then resuming after an expansion is just entitlement
He s being sponsored and paid by NVidia to play Fallout 4 so it makes sense
He s being sponsored by NVida to stream Fallout 4
What race do you play This is what I do for PRM 2 0 For Protoss I do H for Adept make sure to set this for both Gateways and Warpgates o for Adept Psionic Transfer 0 for Disruptor o for Disruptor Purification Nova 9 for Adept upgrade at Twilight Council m for Oracle stastis Trap o for Immortal Barrier m for Carrier Release Interceptors
5 10 min queue for a 1v1 when not at top mmr is pretty low support It s not going to sell copies to do backwards compatibility so it s not worth their time and money
Last time I tried playing WoL I had queues of 5 10 min In HotS I get queues of around 5 30 seconds I don t think there are a lot of people supporting WoL
Welcome to retail where products decrease in monetary value over time Why would a game that was 60 5 years ago still be 60 now This is a clear misunderstanding product value If you want is good now you pay top dollar If you want what was good and new 5 years ago you pay less because it s considered to be worth less It s not a difficult concept And if you want a more detailed explanation for a product s value declining here is one example Game comes out devs need to make a certain profit They release the game at 60 dollars with a minimum of X copies to sell to make a profit Y expected sales and then Z being actual sales Until X copies are sold a price drop will more than likely not be considered unless there is a new expectation that Y will be less than X and you need to drop the price to get to X sales If you get to X sales in a reasonable amount of time the price will not be dropped ideally until you reach Y sales If you are unable to reach Y sales then in order to sell more copies you need to drop the price If you want to ignore the basic algebra behind it they will sell a game at the maximum price they can get away with so that they can get the most money out of people who are going to purchase it regardless and will not drop the price until there is a considerable drop in sales later down the line hence the product losing it s value over time They reduce the price a bit sell a few more copies and keep doing that until they reach the lowest threshold they are willing to sell the game at
Idk I disagree with this I ve had no problem scouting as long as you do a regular worker scout you can get there before the opponent has anything out to deal with your scout The only match up where that is less true really is XvT because Terran s wall will finish while your scout is in their base so it s doomed to die But otherwise you have plenty of time
Except if you read the updated Reddit post by Xeno you would see that Rifkin isn t at fault This is purely between Xeno and enginepeon you just want an excuse to talk shit on Rifkin from what I can see without any effort on follow up research I would like to see your contribution to the community in relation to what Rifkin has done
That s not how Kickstarter works that s how the exchange of goods works
If he didn t sign anything he s not actually required to fulfill his end of the bargain but BTTV is required to fulfill their end of the bargain through Xeno Obviously idk if they had him sign anything but I m assuming they didn t
The problem with HT builds which I ve been experimenting a lot is that you don t have anything to deal with a roach hydra composition Currently Chargelot Archon is great vs really fast Lurkers and Roach Ravager but if they do standard Roach Hydra they will just roll right over you In PvT it s just that Widow Mines are so good vs Chargelots and they don t have the splitting ability of Marines or Zerglings due to their speed so Widow Mine heavy pushes can destroy you
Interesting theory I don t find that very true for me personally as my best winrate is PvP and then PvT but I see Terran as more BM But I can see what you re getting at since it s usually the loser who s bming the most
NGL this is the precise reason why I brought this up LOL Bragging rights all But it s also important for everything to be consistent right Right
I think it is because it also doesn t register clicking on the minimap either so it just in general doesn t count camera movement This might be because with how the engine is built they would have to register all camera movement as an action which would make screen scrolling complicated But that s just a guess I obviously don t know the answer as to why or why notalways good news
Thats what i always expected No surprise imo
Finally I can stop tearing my hair out Thanks OP
Don t thank me thank based god carmac
And here I was afraid it would end up like Dreamhack Hope they won t disappoint us in the end
Carmac should be happy he prob got spending money now that MTG bought up the scenePedrows 1828 NA Spectate quest
Thanks for the answer guys will be checking those gods Just one more thing Mercury Nemesis and Thanatos aren t used anymore They used to be played on jungle
Oh i had completly forgot about the Rhino Thanks for the answer
Malfurion is even stronger now i would put him in the top tier picks There was also a change in displacement not canceling channeling anymore lili s ult for example is not canceled with displacement spells only stuns so that also affected some heroes I think since sylvanas patch uther was also nerfed but he is still a good support in my opinion Stiches was heavily nerfed so not a very good pick anymore Sgt hammer is also kinda bad in the meta right now mainly due to Kael Thas and a more mobile playstyle
Is it up already or only on the 2nd
All the decks i play right now i have the cards to play it and the legendary would be an upgrade to it but not really essential The other decks that requires an essential legendary that i don t have requrie more cards that i don t have handlock still missing 2nd copy of each giant control warrior missing more then 1 legendary That s why i m mostly on doubt between ragnaros and sneeds but would like to hear more advice first
Samb00l just donated 1200 dollars
It really depends on how many classic cards you have if you don t have many or you re lacking more usefull classic cards then gvg cards then just go for classic and you can craft the gvg cards you need
thank you very much Guess it was a stupid answer but i thought once you linked your account it was automatic
Well yeah thats the thing my other cards doesn t really allow me to play a deck needing to craft only one legendary For example i cant play handlock simply by crafting jaraxxus because i m missing 1 of each giant Currently i m playing mostly ramp druid and I don t think it really needs any other legendary don t think harrison would benefit the deck rag has no space maybe sneeds but i don t kno
Yea i always disenchant golden cards but as this is my only copy i kept it in case i would ever use it but since it is not being played on any deck i started to think about DESince it seems to be an issue with blizzard and Bell I jumped onto the European server for now and started playing right away Cross region play turns out to be pretty awesome
I m with Bell and from ON
There is a list of things that already counter a unit that can t shoot up Ghosts liberators bcs perhaps even cyclones in the right situation Ultras are pretty strong though I d like to revisit this topic in 2 months after a meta appears Maybe pros will figure out how good ghosts are before then
There is a middleground the developer should reach in order to match popularity for sure By making tournaments every 2 hours they are still accessible to everyone while they are rare enough that the game feature will still be interesting 6 months from now Shoving a tournament down our throat every hour is a perfect way to make them a boring gimmick down the road Blizzard did it perfectly by testing this out for a week long event a very rational choice IMO
Woah TIL Thanks for the info as a Polt fan I am pleased to hear he has that option
This made me wonder how players like Polt have put off military for so long According to liquipedia Polt is 27 Another would be Bomber who is nearly 30 iirc While Forgg for reference is only 25
And here in Canada i ll just be downing oatmeal and rice like the pleb I am
Well that explains half of my losses on ladder Unplayable game
Ya absolutely this is a great point Also if the league even announces that they might start random drug testing for coke it s a good first step to combat potential heavy users Few of the majority are going to risk their multimillion dollar job for drug charges It might be enough to slow down the pandemic a lot of people say we have
Do some research on microdosing if you haven t Using coke or other amphetamines while playing is absolutely a possibility
I play random to improve in every match up It also makes watching tournaments more fun
I will say he does do good thinks for the scene for a niche crowd He s not highly attractive to the mainstream mostly due to his occasional unprofessional attitude But that s entirely understandable he s not a professional caster and he hasn t been bred into one If you lack some professionalism you can make up for it like Nathanias does with charisma though Grahm doesn t really have that Looking at his example of the screen grab It s totally fine up until grahm says ya and we are MAIN WCS stream so you wait Poignant example of a lack of experience professionalism here I can t name a single other caster that would have voiced that the same way It s fair evidence that you dig yourself into many of the situations that your so called esports dirt folder contains
I worked this summer with a job that paid for my groceries and the group I was working with ate 2 circles of brie a WEEK 2 of 4 ppl were french Canadian 1 of 4 was from France Me being the only non french one experienced a summer of eating more brie and cheese than any normal human should comsume It was glorious I only get it on the rare occasion now because it s pretty expensive relative to other foods
Is he in Proleague If so what team is he playing for
I just spent my morning watching this and wow I m glad I did That is Mvp levels of comeback awesomeness
Everyones talking about the geese and eagle but how about that blue heron at the top left That dudes just scheming and plotting his attack in a timely fasion
Game three Shana delayed his expo to go cloak banshee doing some damage to his economy Lilbow makes stalker to defend while sending two dts delaying mining Shana makes raven marine seige tank and seiges lilbows nat Lilbow eventually defends with stalkers and dts both players take a 3rd and settle things down After macroing for a while both armies clash in the middle of the map while lilbow destroys Shanas worker line with adepts Both players are low army supply Shana has 0 workers and GG s Map score 2 1 Lilbow
Game two Lilbow defended a proxy reaper widow mine and liberator cheese without much loss but then lost his warprism to two liberators trying to counter push Shana macroed on two base and made marine marauder with tanks and liberators mixed in He defended Lilbow s adept stalker push while harassing with liberators Lilbow tried one last push with warprism and GG d Map score 1 1
He just won game one with a cool adept warprism rush off two base The marine target fire was done well enough but let s wait till he faces a korean like FlaSh
If you want something to listen to while watching here s the original LOTV soundtrack to play while the game is on english replacement audio https www youtube com watch v b2Wq6cWkdHo
