Every time there is a balance patch I get nervous and almost every time I am happy with how blizzard handled it So glad they didn t do the spore nerf
Thank the lord I m not even a zerg player but I feel like the current spore is needed because of the lack of a good anti air solution from zerg and that hasn t changed since HOTS
In reality the nerf only impacts ZvZ but I am also glad it didn t go through DH showed a lot of variety in the ZvZ meta I thought
Mutas absolutely still have a place as a viable opener because ravagers can t actually hit well micro d mutalisks If spores were nerfed we d just have the old ZvZ meta which was muta vs muta slapfests It was fun to play for a while but when all the ZvZs were the exact same ling bane muta it gets a bit boring to play
Agreed
I play Z and I absolutely hate mutas I would have died if the spore was nerfed
Because Zerg had good anti air options in WoL D
The interesting thing here is how much this reminds me of BW Remember how if one of the zerg players went hydra lurker vs muta ling the korean commentators would go oh this matchup is pretty much over Here in LotV I have no idea what the outcome of such a confrontation would look like but the interesting issue remains alike and that is the hydras cannot be everywhere and meanwhile the mutas are darting in and out harassing anywhere and everywhere they can be
Mutad are already very viable in ZvZ don t know why they even tested it Happy it did not go through
Ya I love the feedback and the listening to the community It s way better than it was in WoL or HotS
hi bot
Wow that was fast And I m glad they re ditching the spore crawler change after we saw some great ZvZ muta presence this past weekend
That was pretty quick
Probably wanted to give pros a heads up so the ones going to IEM Taipei had a chance to adjust
and winter regional qualifiers
True though those are already going on
The ones that are ongoing only have like 1 2 matches left anyways I think
When will the patch go live on regular ranked ladder
They said the 28th in the Community Feedback
Well they promised that the patch was rolling out on the 28th in the last community update There would have been hell to pay if they failed to roll out a patch on or before then
I m a little worried about PvZ it s really tough to hold Zerg all ins But we ll see I guess it might just mean we have to play differently
Pretty much it boils down to the same opener I ve decided where you build 4 phoenix to stop muta and then non stop build immortals and upgrades until you get to the lategame
Dont immortals get wrecked by hydra What kind of supply you aiming at before transitioning Zerg here so not familiar
Depends If you scout roach hydra then you start producing heavy on ground army If you scout air you mass more phoenix before transitioning I usually tech to storm archon either way so my comp can fight almost anything including an ultra transition Pretty much you gotta see if the zerg is going to base all in or try to play a macro game with you
Awesome cheers So I assume you open single stargate phx and robo after third depending on what you scout Also what would your ratios of phx void zealot adept archon templar immortal disruptor be against a zerg who seems to be going roach hydra but isn t clearly committing to a big allin e g more relevant in the lower leagues they re building an army and taking bases and could decide to allin pressure at any moment Finally if you playing 2v2s against a Z T team how would the composition change assuming zerg is roach etc t is bio Thanks in advance for sorry for the question spam I m decent as Zerg diamond but got NFI how to play Protoss coherently short of mass sky or random yolo troll styles
Double stargate usually but thats considering you get phoenix harass in I ve been opting for a couple of adepts early on for base protection and securing fast thirds Adept harass can really help you gauge how strong they are and their composition Honestly if you can buy time mass voidray and carrier is really strong It takes 3 bases though and if they all in you have to micro your early void oracle really well They key to beating ravager all ins though is lots of immortal production You could just assume the opener is 2 star 2 robo twilight temp tech tech The build I was following was from a progame I can t recall who He opened double star and then stalker
Thanks again How would you get upgrades on 2 3 base with this Also how many gateways you aiming for on 2 or 3 base to support this
I add gates depending on my composition More gates for heavier ground army Keep adding gates when you get into the lategame for better remax Usually try to grab 3 attack and some air upgrades for lategame The 3 ground is so when you remax after a big fight you can make a ton of archons and your ground army will be very tough This is strictly PvZ though
Perfect thanks
Ultras are terrible units vs chargelot archon immortal The real problem is trying to kill a defensive Z before broodlords get out because pushing into good defensive lurkers is really hard which is good otherwise Z just straight up dies to chargelot archon immortal before broodlords
But hydra get wrecked super hard by storm and disruptors one of which you should have before the hydra numbers get out of control
wow you may not be able to triple expand riskless
as a bronzie i think i should shut up about this
If Trump can run fro president you can damn sure shout Bronzie opinions from the fucking rooftop Go for it young Terran
I THINK ADEPT SHOULD GET MORE DAMAGEEEEE I will leave now
pvz is going to be frustrating
PvZ is already frustrating
True
I hope the next step is toning down Ravager Bile I d love to see what a casting range decrease would do and PvZ could be in a good spot
I think a damage reduction vs buildings would be a nice change especially in a ZvP
I don t care about ravagers lurkers is a pain in the ass I think it should be Hive tech
Thing is in tournaments there s not a lot of games where lurkers look un manageable disruptors shit on them Making ravagers slightly less strong against protoss could have a snowball effect that makes everything that come after more manageable anyways which often happens when tinkering with early game units
I guess that sounds reasonable
Then every zerg would die to a 3 base charge archon immortal protoss push in every game It is litterally the only thing that allows zerg to survive to hive
And they re fucking awesome I switched to zerg in LotV for 2 reasons it s the only race I haven t hit masters with and lurkers are badass as fuck If they take away lurkers I have to go back to being an all in protoss or a whiny terran C
You should seriously try phoenix into chargelot archon immortal It shits on Lurkers especially if the Zerg is attacking with them Phoenix can lift up Lurkers and archons immortals destroy them as well I face this all the time in KR and it s strong Stalker disruptor not very good versus it imo
Might as well make it a melee ability then Damage nerf is be better I think
Current range is 9 that s huge There s room for toning it down without making it short
Can you shorten the bile range without making the Ravagers a useless counter to well placed Liberator harass
That s an issue yes ravagers are needed to defend against liberators but when the roles are reversed and the ravagers attack they just shit on libs and tanks
So long as ravagers are the only viable counter to liberators until T3 then they absolutely cannot be nerfed in any way
They can t do this because of liberator range ie bunny s build The only way for zerg to deal with liberator range is ravager bile or air units It s poor design for liberators to force a zerg to go air tech when that is not their tech path of choice
Vs ranged liberator cheese openings that can t be scouted no range 9 is fine
I always thought the bile CD would be the best way to tone down the ravager You keep the ability to defend against libs and you can still kill them with the same number of biles when they harrass but they re more manageable later on
That makes a lot of sense actually would like to see them try something like this
I personally think a small casting delay on Bile would be nice
The longass delay before damage isn t enough
Yeah these nerf ravager posts are completely moronic There is literally zero pro players complaining about Ravagers They are simply not a problem I guess I could throw up a Terran flair and start whining about tank nerfs or something too
They can t do this because of liberator range ie bunny s build
Make it less stackable If you can t oneshot Pylons now the PO nerf won t matter that much for defending allins In big fights you mostly spread them out anyway
Damn Well I guess we don t need the TvZ ZvP TvP show matches if this is going live If Blizzard is still looking at potentially adding the spore change I have Snute and TLO willing to do a ZvZ show match this week I ll keep ya ll posted
I don t know possible it is but it d be great if you could get it out before patch probably not possible im assuming it hits tomorrow morning during maintenance A lot of people are iffy on the spore change
I d still be interested in the PvT and PvZ to see how the changes have affected those matchups
I love the comments Terrans complaining that their race is broken and weak protoss saying that this nerf will kill them zergs saying that the PB nerf will make them die to air so in a nutshell every race is UP and OP at the same time
Schroedinger s Race
Brilliant
So nothing new
The thing is all of these things are kind of true Terran have been suffering from a pure balance standpoint Their win rates are low in both matchups and PvT is downright frustrating for them All the changes in this patch should give them some more room to do their thing which is good Protoss have been relying on heavy Photon Overcharge usage to counter the strength of Zerg all ins and general economic harass And heavy Adept pressure to limit the army advantage of Terran in the mid game I see it as taking away stilts from the 5 6 guy in a basketball game Sure the stilts were unfair but now he s a fucking 5 6 guy in a basketball game Zerg still struggles with air compositions even with the power of PB which could outright cause other players to not use air in their compositions In the end all of these changes are GOOD changes because they were little bits of too much making up for other flaws But now we get to see the other flaws and hopefully it ll all shake out for the best
Only one of these races has data support for the UP position
Not at the same time At different times or rather at different stages of a game Against different matchups
PvZ be prepared for the return of the Skytoss
Did carriers get buffed Don t they still take 90 years to make Bomb really never did much to carriers
No buff to carriers still too long of a build time and still not viable in most circumstances
I have been experimenting with going carriers in every game so far I can get to high M with em but it s really difficult
Shouldn t you bomb the interceptors
You cannot cast parasitic bomb on the interceptors themselves anymore if that is what you meant
Ah it was too strong I m guessing
same reason why BCs are not used
I doubt skytoss will return
Should just release on the 26th for everywhere except Korea where they can release it on the 28th like planned due to matches
Can blizzard please acknowledge the Disruptor aggro bug Are they even aware of it
Pretty sure they re aware but it s under not game breaking well get to it eventually
It really is a drastic change Playing with mutas vs the nerfed spores was amazing since you could actually harass with a reasonable amount of mutas Defending it was pretty difficult Mass queen seemed to do well but I feel that leaves you open to mass expanding or passive transitions I don t think it s the right change when mutas are as strong as they are now I also don t like that the spore hard counters them as hard as they do but it seems necessary
Really excited for the viper change I still enjoy a heavy muta style and or late game 40 muta switches 60 dmg parasitic bombs means you need more than 2 bombs ticking on each muta every tick in order to kill any one of them Before it was only 1 1 2 bombs making a 2 parasitic bomb hit nearly impossible to prevent muta s death By the time you pull out the 2 mutas they all still die haha Now if I pull back after 2 bombs go off they ll all live if 3 I ll still may have time to keep the rest majority of my flock alive Also can t wait to basetrade protoss again Nothing more frustrating than having an 150 supply army lose to 8 Pylon Overcharges and a warp in Looking forward to the patch
Or your scouting overlord dying to a pylon and that being a good use of energy
depending on the timing and what toss scouts out of the zerg still a good use of energy
I played a ZvZ where I was behind in muta vs muta but managed to sneak out 4 vipers with PB I was more mineral starved than gas starved I guess I figured out afterwards that ended up being about 2 3 vipers more than I actually needed to turn the tide in my favor Since the damage stacks it creates crazy overkill potential If you force a muta vs muta fight and can land PBs then even if they split they are probably taking mutas out of the fight and cause a favorable engagement for the person without PB even if they are significantly behind in mutas I think that s why the even though the damage change is heavy it is still going to be a really powerful spell you still need to split and that even perfectly splitting takes away a lot of your advantage at least for mutas which don t have a lot of range For the majority of players who probably can t split well enough anyway it will at least tone down how ridiculously fast it can melt an airball
Should be a good iteration of the game I m interested in seeing how tvz and tvp develop after this and the potential liberator nerf that might be needed
That s not how it works 1 less damage from the Adept is a really REALLY big deal because it passes the Marine HP breakpoint Saying build 1 more Adept and it s the same is completely wrong because this statement assumes your Adepts put out a concentrated stream of DPS ignoring break points and overkill Currently a Marine without combat shields has 45 HP and an Adept does 23 damage per shot In two shots the Adept kills the marine 46 dmg to 45 hp After the patch an Adept does 22 damage per shot Two shots only does 44 damage leaving the marine with 1 HP This is a BIG DEAL it requires a whole extra shot to kill the Marine If we are considering a pure Adept army vs a pure Marine army the Adepts just got 50 less effective they take 1 5x as much time to kill the marines as they used to So the DPS of the Adept might only have gone down a tiny bit but because it passes the Marine HP breakpoint it s a huge effect
Don t forget it also needs 3 shots for an scv now
ya i think its appropriate though not everything should hit like a DT
Also keep in mind upgrades With 1 attack the adepts will be as powerful as they are now However none of the current adept early pressures have 1 So this is basically an early game adept nerf that will deal with warp prism or regular gateway pressure plays Those plays will still be good in the mid game once you have 1 but it should be easier to defend for T because you won t have to lose SCVs earlier
That s what im saying I quoted the first comment from the battle net forums
Also stim now hurts more than it helps for marine vs adept until you have combat shields
and it was all about the SCV s I really hope that Protoss still is able to trade cost efficent with a terran without the need to rush tec Terrans will always have the mobility let us have the efficiency
The time of us having cost efficency just ended Back to needing to rush tech or timings
In mid late game they will still need 3 shots to kill shield marines anyway This nerf mostly affects early game
Actually it still makes a difference with shields since right now adepts will 2 shot marines with shields if they stim It only stops mattering after 1 if the Terran does not have better upgrades
To be more specific 1 damage will allow Adepts to 2 shot Marines unless they have 2 armor this scenario should never happen unless a Forge was sniped while upgrading 2 damage will always 2 shot stimmed no shield Marines regardless of upgrades
After the change 1 damage on Adept does not allow them to 2 shot a Marine with 1 armor The only way an Adept returns to its 2 shot status is if Toss is ahead on upgrades If they re even the Marine takes 3 shots Edit Wait I think I m wrong Adepts get 2 damage against light for each upgrade Disregard
Yeah adept damage will be 10 12 and upgrades will stay 1 1 Darn tricksy protosses
Yeah because units deal big chunks of other units HP in damage this is why slight HP buffs are such a big deal Even if the health gained or in this case damage lost is not much compared to the previous number the amount of shots required to kill the unit on the other hand makes a big difference This is why CS is such a big deal For instance lets say you re fighting Banshees A banshee needs two shots to kill a marine but three to kill a marine with combat shield Despite gaining slightly more than 20 more HP the marine is 50 more resilient in this case so it s almost equivalent to the marine getting 50 more health for all intents and purposes Roaches are another exemple the take 3 shots to kill a marine or 4 with CS so it s a 33 survival increase Hell DT are probably the most extreme case they take two shots rather than one shot meaning marines have a doubled effective health So in the end it really isn t about how much the numbers have changed but about their practical effect in a combat scenario That 1 damage difference effectively makes marines 50 tougher in the early game where the adept is problematic but it has a negligible effect in late game confrontations where the adept is fine
The change only really affects Adepts until they have 1 attack at which point they will be able to 2 shot the same things they do now It s an early game change only But just like saying just get 1 more adept saying just get 1 attack is missing the point of why this is a huge change as you say Early adept attacks are currently strong because they can do things with ONLY 2 adepts and WITHOUT a forge
From what I ve read in analysis this effect disappears the moment protoss researches 1 ground weapons Even if terran researches 1 armor Both for marines and scvs So this is mostly to curb down adept all ins including the prism all in as it would require 1 to reach the same effect and thus be delayed and map control to some extent
I m just going to add in that this change only affects the adept marine relationship before any upgrades except adept attack speed Once adept get 1 attack upgrades they ll two shot marines Once marines get shields they will die in 3 shots both pre and post patch
Yeah Adept can get 1 attack but Terran can get 1 armor As for shields marines will still die in 3 shots but if they ve been stimmed they STILL take 3 shots to kill previously only took 2 Gotta consider all the upgrades coming into play Edit I think I m wrong Adepts get 2 damage vs light with each upgrade Bummer for Terrans
It takes 2 armor to negate 1 I belive
i wonder if adding an oracle to adept pushes will be effective now It deals a constant stream of damage with its beam so potentially it can quickly kill off all the 1 hp marines scvs left after 2 shots from the adept
You ll have to add a stargate to the push which either means you re pushing with fewer adepts or later into a stronger defense and an opponent who hasn t faced as much pressure
In the mid game not much is altered A marine with combat shields needs 3 adept shots to kill Pre nerf and post nerf adepts will always take 3 shots to kill a combat shielded marine so mid game interaction is left mostly untouched They didn t nerf adept attack speed so 50 attack speed adepts will still do great against combat shielded marines in a straight on engagement It just won t be as one sided since marines after a stim back down to 45 health won t be easy prey The power of recent PvT builds also hinges on forgoing upgrades for more gateway units or faster tech since adepts do not benefit greatly from 1 attack Now getting an upgrade lead on a terran allows protoss to two shot workers a huge advantage considering how effective adept harass has shown itself to be
Exciting When does this fo live
You guys are sick Keep it up
Good to see that DK came to his senses and threw out the proposed spore crawler nerf Keep it up
I wish they d have tested adjusting the adept more I m still not convinced the damage was the problem In my opinion the mobility and vision of the shade was the problem
So Thor change and siege tank change from the table Raven
Not really up to date with sc2 Isn t this a pretty good thing
I hope the patch goes live today I have no motivation to play with the current outdated game
Has the mod been updated to this
Thank fuck they didnt include the spore nerf I wasn t looking forward to pure muta vs muta especially the whoever rushes muta the fastest wins kind Rest looks good though
protoss is gonna get shat all over in tvp The matchup was broken on both sides but blizz only fixed one Liberator ghost armies are untouchable
If thats the case it will be patched too Also liberator ghost is probably one of the most expensive things I can think of for terran
I m not talking pure liberator ghost I just mean 4 10 liberators and 3 ghosts with a bio ball This is a composition you can comfortably get off of 3 bases and if the protoss does not have tempests they hardly ever can win a fight
Liberators in general are so frustrating for protoss in the lower leagues If you don t have air units ready good luck being able to shoot them with stalkers By the time you get void ray phoenix they get shut down with marines
Everything is frustrating for lower leagues
You re right It s a brutal frustrating game but that s why I like it Starcraft is not for casuals Things like muta switches or endless bio drops are understandably frustrating but nothing makes me rage like having a liberator sitting behind your mineral line out of pylon range when the only AA you have are a few stalkers that can t reach it without getting obliterated
Nah man flying my factory in their base building Mines and then killing all his workers is not
GG PvZ This is a disgrace
Im toss and i really like this changes from a design point of view The only thing that i dislike is that it forced us to double stargate pretty hard And i hope we can do somethign about that in the future
Man i am scared i am a protoss player and i always have trouble with speedlings until i learned to proper position my pylons and use PO but now that we have half of charges i think zerg can abuse it pretty easily with his unit mobility
Did you play Protoss in WoL A mistake in building placement or unit hold position was an auto loss Man I switched to terran at the wrong time
Has the patch been relased yet
Glad they don t plan to implement the spore change I hope they look at tanks next TvT is killing me So this patch comes out on thursday
damn I can already taste protoss tears welling up
Don t worry we ll be downvoted to oblivion by anti protoss bias until we get more nerfs We re near 40 in ZvP and this pylon overcharge nerf is going to make Roach Ravager pushes insanely stronger Pylons are so easy to snipe with corrosive bile and now that it costs 50 energy we re super fucked I hope you like the taste
i still think it s blizzard s fault for coming up with attacking pylons they are stuck with it and so they are desperately trying to make it viable
That is the story of Protoss in Starcraft 2 Forcefield and MsC have been band aids for poor design
Protoss is definitely the worst race design There has always been the massive problem of defenders advantage with protoss because the game is balanced around warp in mechanics Terran has longest range units and sim city for their defense and zerg has creep and queens Protoss always just had to make due with whatever quick fix blizzard gave them forcefield and msc
I completly agree about the original sin about the defender advantage But since LotV where the warpgate has been finally strongly nerfed you could have strong gateway units again like in BW I m dreaming of a world where pylon overcharge and force field disappears completly as they are bad design And they could buff gateway units gets as a tradeoff That was not possible because of warpgate before but now they can do it
They did buff gateway units Look what happened
They didn t buff any of the existing gateway units They added a gateway unit that is really strong with the buffed warp prism They buffed a midgame zealot upgrade That s it Stalkers still suck Zealots are still weak early Sentries take all of your gas and are useless because of the buffed shooting pylon
I agree with everything you said My point is that the adept buffed gateway centric play and now they are scaling it back a bit
Gateway centric aggressive play Adept gateway still sucks shit at defending early vs roaches or marauders without overcharge
would you trade your MC for a shield battery just curious
I honestly think that instead of PO Pylons should grant a bonus to either shield armor and or shield recharge while a protoss unit stands in their power field I mean zerg has home field advantage with creep terran can set up really good simcity defenses but PO allows defense with basically no units shouldn t defense imply actually having units to defend
sim city can be used by all races though zerg use evo chambers to funnel hellions and toss wall off the natural for fast expo that being said im not against the PO changing to buff units as it still means toss has to scout and have actual freaking units rdy to defend
P and T simcity are for two different things T simcity is to allow seigetank liberator to poke from max range P simcity is only about controlling zerglings and new in LOTV maximizing pylon surface area at the front
First time I ve seen that suggested but it s really good idea actually Get rid of photon overcharge and give pylons an automatic shield recharge ability to units and buildings in its radius Encourages the protoss to build units to defend rather than just rely on cheap abilities
Even if you did that Protoss would get shit on by early all ins To make the pylon shield recharge ability viable early game it would be broken mid and late game
If it was strong enough then sure It would have to be comparable strength to like bunkers which are insanely strong due to repair and low commitment due to salvage
That s debatable since pylons also give supply If you need PO to activate this hypothetical buff then sure but if it s passive it might be stacking up to 5 or so but not too strong
The people who downvote only due to race are idiots Anyways the problem wasn t pylons when an attack comes to the front door with ravagers it s that protosses can sit in their base with the MSC and be perfectly safe from any counter harass A zerg run by usually only consists of 10 20 lings or 5 or so roaches which get murdered by pylon overcharge A 5 zealot run by requires 6 8 roaches to deal with proper micro Obviously some races should excel at things better than others but permanent overcharge safety wasn t fun and offered little to punish protoss for moving out Unfortunately while this nerf helps with that like you mentioned it s going to make the actual pushes harder to defend and the only thing I can think of is to change bile to 50 damage vs buildings
What I am worried about is how this will affect early liberator strategies that often depended on photon overcharge to defend it unless you just went stargate first Liberators tuck themselves in a corner so they only target 2 mineral patches but that is enough to make it very hard for stalkers to defend it on some maps
Or maybe use the great insight you mentioned All defense should require unit control of some kind Currently the all purpose PO can be used defensively or offensively because of the way the MSC works This unit was put in the game to give protoss some early game poking potential against zerg by privaledge of recall Poke a bit do some dmg or threaten to do so then recall back and turtle It was pretty elegant but still not enough Then overcharge debuted and essentially filled that niche twice Now that the WP and adept have stepped into the meta it is aparent that protoss can have some potency without recall but still requires PO Its a bit of a shame that the WPadept meta couldnt develop more and somehow seek some balance But the reality is that it in combination with PO limits terran far too effectively to stay unchanged I welcome the nerf and hope that it allows terran and toss to have more than 1 strat in this MU The question remains though can toss defend against zerg w o PO I don t think they can unless their offense becomes their defense I think that PO being nerfed gives toss the window to show blizzard how we can utilize the race defensively without need of the spell with units and strong micro but simultaneously dread the thought of more losses vs the very potent rorava timings I would like to see in the future of protoss PO removed from the game entirely the zealot and the stalker to recieve an early game utility buff to compensate and for stasis trap to become a more interesting keystone in how protoss pull off defense I sort of wish the sentry took a stronger role as a defensive unit also That at home it had some fortifying ability that helps preemptively defend against drops Such as the sentry can recall a unit to its location Spell is channeled and cancelled with dmg Being in a power grid makes it cost half the energy per unit Maybe scale the energy cost per unit type 1 4 energy for gateway units 3 4 for a robo unit So effectively 5 6 sentries could recall a majority of protoss army Units being recalled are vulnerable and immobile At least then toss has the ability to push and defend with units that need micro and cost money and a spell that needs foresight Moreover multiple sentries at each base gives the protoss the flexibility to fortify all 3 bases or just 1 base depending on the kind of drop instead of slugging an MSC to the drop sight then following the inevitable carnage It also requires good scouting which IMO should be the best and most reliable way to subdue incoming harassment Lastly offensive sentries could be used to refortify an army after a succesful defense but would lose all of their energy in doing so which makes them effectively dead weight in a fight
Yeah they get murdered by pylon overcharge but that s because the protoss army is slow as balls and won t be able to home and defend in any realistic timeframe While the zerg has a queens a creep network and fast units the protoss only has warp in which got nerfed And since gateway units are kinda shitty it makes perfect sense that protoss needs a bit more help dealing with harass
That pylon overcharge buys plenty of time for the protoss to get back to the base especially when the MSC has full energy
Yes that s my argument Pylon overcharge is necessary to buy time
its sad but true with corrosive bile hitting buildings this is gonna be a pain to hold
Yep it feels like Stargate will be the go to opener in pvz That s assuming it s not a 1 base Roach ravager rush which I m not sure how strong that will be if at all
Still won t be as much as T whines with a positive winrate
not sure how T can whine any more since adepts are nerfed how adepts destroyed bio was the biggest problem but now it s over T is very strong now
Wait one week
optimist I see
T never stops whining Even when T has a 70 winrate in TvP and TvZ then T whines that they play too much TvT
8 armor Ultras are still sick against Terran
yeah but so are liberators against mutas all races need some OP shit
I m barely seeing anyone acknowledge the adept change I m assuming that s because terran will still need something to complain a out after they lose
Warp prisms will be the next gripe
They took their time but I think these are the balance changes that most people wanted
regarding the overcharge 15 seconds 1 25 attacks per second 12 attacks each attack is 30 damage so 12x30 360 total damage its 360 damage for 25 energy or 360 25 14 4 damage per energy for the new version just copy the numbers except 20 seconds and 1 25 becomes 1 to get 600 50 12 damage per energy by the numbers that means its nerfed in damage but not very much 2 damage per energy and its not as spammable that makes this far more strategic since now you can t spam 7 overcharges and defend a large roach attack with a handful of adepts lets see the roach pushes boys edit of course this doesnt reflect on being able to run and hold out the overcharge which is now less spammable this change could be big but its good now you cant 3 base and tech up so easily
Well 3 base and tech up easily got us up to around 40 in PvZ Now let s the where that goes
I think the most important note is that pylons are easily snipeable with ravagers I predict PvZ being even more zerg favored in the near future
It s Likely it will be for the first month 6 weeks but i think this is a very good step towards balancing if this nerf proves to be to much they can look into buffs elsewhere to hopefully bring Protoss back into line that said i am pretty sure what we are gonna see is a meta shift into more unit based defensive builds with a msc for back up as opposed to the reverse which is exactly where we are atm especially now that this change opens toss up to more harassment through drops banshees muta and the like which imo is a good thing for everyone
Yeah this is basically certain
We need a way to buff pvz without affecting pvt
I don t think the Spore change and the viper change should be put in around the same time As much as I like playing muta styles I say let s see how the meta is after the Viper nerf before we decide to re nerf the spore
there s no need to nerf the spore it s already weak the biggest advantage of the muta style is the mobility even with todays spores you need quite a lot of them otherwise they will just be focused down pb nerf is ok imo
Can someone please explain the difference between duration and weapon period I m unsure what the difference is between the two
Duration is how long the overcharge is active on the pylon Weapon period is how much time is between each attack
Weapon period would make more sense being called attack delay
Ohhh ok interesting Thank you

I wonder how much money it took to buy Life off I mean the guy made 460 000 in four years of work his match fixing price must be something like 10K if BboongBboong and YoDa were getting 4 6K for their thrown matches
yep 460000 prize money plus the salary if confirmed there must be a lot of money involved let s hope least people possible
A professor one time told me he was approached by a parent after class to buy a grade The dad whipped out his check book and the prof said two million the dad said what and the prof said if this gets out it not only ruins my job here it ruins my career as an educator and it ruins my career as an academic If this gets out it invalidates my entire adult life s effort You want me to gamble that then you better be able to comfortably take care of me into retirement That s what s at stake This kid didn t lose money made leading up the kid lost all the money that would have been available after this including any tangential work related to this Hope the kid took enough to not worry
Your professor is a boss
Assuming he doesnt have repay the money
Well I think it depends on potential payoff for the ones who were going to bet that he would lose So if it s 10 to 1 maybe they pay him more
So Life in prison
most likely a life ban from the scene and probably anything else in korea he is basically fucked in korea shit like this follows you forever
Not necessarily we need to wait and see the facts how he s prosecuted and if he s convicted Dragon had a match fixing scandal and was eventually found to be innocent now he streams with a decent following I think Life could still be an SC2 pro if he s found to be innocent but that s a big and optimistic if
They have a 98 conviction rate He s utterly screwed
I thought it was for maphacking
The initial controversy with Dragon was over stream cheating not maphacking He openly admitted and apologized for listening to a live stream of the match against TheStC Later in an unrelated thing he was accused of match fixing vehemently denied it and was eventually cleared of all charges but not before he took some pretty bad flak for it
Essentially his normal life in Korea is over Best move if he gets convicted or whatever you call it for him will probably to live elsewhere
The long game to avoid military service It s all clear to me now
How familiar are you with korean culture Their entire society condemns you the second you get convicted for this His future employers are gonna see thos etc
people should see the things that happen in kpop peoples lives get ruined over silly shit that they didn t even do
For those out of the know he s how ridiculous KPop gets Female pop stars frequently have clauses in their contracts stating that they can t date anyone Ever The idea is that fans who desire to be with singers will feel like the celebrity is attainable very deliberate use of the word attainable here so long as they re single Female performers have lost rights to their creative work and have lost contracts over paparazzi catching them on dinner dates And these women rarely if ever receive another contract from any entertainment company Those women are blacklisted throughout the industry for going on a dinner date South Korea takes celebrity culture way too seriously
Hell a guy s live was ruined for saying that he went to Stanford and the crazy thing is that he did actually do so
You re referring to tablo of epik high He suffered a stupid amount of stress and hardship after the whole fiasco but he is pretty much over it now His albums are stellar and the group is doing better than ever
Also it was proven he actually went
Still he was guilty even after proven innocent
Sounds like a Reddit conviction
Rip Tablo
People didnt want to believe he was so academically successful and intelligent Then look at the IU pedophile bullshit
Yeah its insane how fucked up people can become just because of rumours Lifes status is basically destroyed even if he was innocent
You overestimate it He ll never have a possibility to work in e sport again but Starcraft isn t important enough to really prevent him from getting a job ever again The other problem is he ll have to go to school again
Starcraft maybe is not important enough but think about this He is getting charged for being a part of a match fixing scheme Starcraft does not matter at all in this case If he is proven guilty in a court then it doesn t matter that he did matchfixing in a game like starcraft what matters is that he actually was involved in the matchfixing in the first place I have a friend who did stupid shit when he was younger and now his criminal record is always following him when he applies for work He is a blue collar worker and even that job he got thanks to his mother who is also working in that firm I can add that this is Sweden Now think about South Korea where crimes are actually taken with more seriousness than in Sweden If he is lucky he can manage to find a job and live a normal life
I understand the point My sister s boyfriend was part of a jewelry shop robbery he parked the car a few streets away his cousin told him he just had a small course to make that he was right back The guy didn t know about any robbery and spent one year in prison Although he was freed because it was clear his cousin was the bad guy he has served a sentence although small He followed a program with the prison with the goal to get back to work had a small job in a big State company and after a few years went job hunting again So I had thought that you could live with a judiciary past but I guess this isn t the case everywhere
Dude you need to calm down He s not royally fucked for life His eSports career might be but he s not
Savior didn t leave his house for years after the incident
The people who can really speak as to whether this stuff marks you for life or not are the people who ve been through this What does Savior do today Did he recover from his situation If he says yes well then But if he talks about all these opportunities that he knows full well he s excluded from even after all these years well that s the kind of stuff that you won t walk away from
Looks like Life was the true sAviOr of sc2 indeed
Why did it have to be a zerg player
he was corrupted by the Overmind
Spreads like tumors
The David Kim curse is far scarier than the Artosis curse D
The Kurse
Wow david kim is a Ghost
Wonder if he dreamed about Yoda too Who are you dreaming about now Dayvie Answer us
Our prophet has spoken
Not like this
Not life this
Life found a way alright
David Kim s dream was about Life s match fix Sauce http us battle net sc2 en forum topic 20419652888
David Kim confirmed an oracle no wonder he s made Protoss so strong Kappa
Heartbreaking No other words simply heartbreaking
Man life was the iconic player of the HOTS era This is just sad to see
Even late WoL going head to head agains Mvp and winning
Now I m super sour about Life Denying Mvp his G5L fair and square only to throw it all away by matchfixing years later
I never said he wasn t the better player hence fair and square He beat him and denied him the G5L that he could have won
Best FPL anti pick ever
So if Life does get banned does CJ Bunny automatically get into Code S
Bunny is the only person on the planet praying that life is found guilty xD
I guess even Bunny would hope for Life to not be guilty this would be a huge blow for Korean pros especially
Haha he ll get wrecked by TY again
Yes
He s only 19 and has essentially fucked up his future in Korea or anywhere else for that matter forever
Assuming he s found guilty that is
Even if he s found innocent people will talk about it and he may find himself in KeSpa jail
Even if you proved yourself as innocence you are always going to get discriminated This is particularly the case in Asia
plus 19 is an age of majority in Korea that timing
I don t know how that works in Korea but it s a principle of law that you are tried under the law at the time of the crime occuring ie if you were less than 18 when a crime happened you ll be charged as a minor even if you re 20 when caught If the law changed and became harsher you ll be tried under a softer law too
that would make sense
Is it possible that ninjas kidnapped his family and forced him to do it
Build a wall to keep the cheating Koreans out of WCS and make SC2 great again
I guess we have some idea of the names Wolf was hearing during the Prime case now
Usually I really enjoy sc2 drama but not this time Please dont be true
To be honest the authorities really need to bust this case wide open and see just how deep the rabbit hole goes I m pretty sure matchfixing in Korea is a wide sweeping issue and that KeSPA are very reluctant to investigate it further especially if we ve seen a number of suspicious series from top tier pros and have some very big names in the scene indicted on charges
R I P Life and Korean SC2
The scene doesn t rely on one individual The scene will move on and that s all there is to it
The scene will move on but this may affect not only viewership but sponsorship as well which would be a big deal The extent of the damage is tough to guess though
I know if i was an investor this would be a red light for me if he s found guilty it s downright despicable he had the potential to be the best some might say he was no excuse for this shit
Ehh seeing your favorite player get banned for life is going to have a major impact on a lot of viewers including me
he was the only player that got me interested in the game since WOL the only reason I would watch the streams when I had to be sleeping This is really sad If he stops playing I don t think I ll watch sc2 that much
Say that to NA CSGO
This seems hard to believe Why would someone like Life accept money to fix a match when he s already so successful Why would he need it THIS SUCKS
Young and stupid He s only 19 years old 19 year old me with 400k made would be doing a lot of stupid things
and the fixed matches were done when he was 18 yo
Maybe he was the one to pay DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
I m absolutely shattered Life has a legitimate claim as the best SC2 player ever His multiple championships his unending skill at playing series and his opponents We just lost our Lebron James to illegal gambling
If it s true then I don t get it He earned so much money from last 3 years that almost no SC2 pro did and only small percentage of adults can earn that much what reason can make you fix a match after having earned that much
Even Savior was at the top of the world when be was match fixing
Criminal gang pressuring your family or your life unless you throw a match
I feel ill
All the banned players chould have show matches sAviOr FTW
Seriously He s a suspect he has by no means found guilty yet He allegedly received money for matchfixing until he s found guilty you should all keep your cool and just wait it out Innocent until proven guilty I find it disappointing to see how quickly you guys are jumping the media bandwagon and how fast you do a full 180 on your opinion on someone who is just a suspect tt This is how someone s career and name gets ruined after having been a suspect but proven innocent Plenty of stories around Charges get dropped but the person s name is ruined forever Also Life made almost 500k during his career so financially likely would not have been a motivator IF he already matchfixed he or his close relatives possibly got threatened by dangerous people who don t like being fucked with
I cant imagine they would arrest him with no evidence He might not be guilty but you cant say its looking good
if he s a suspect and was arrested it means they have evidence to support the case as much as i don t want it to be true it seems the odds are against him and even if he was pressured to matchfix from some outside source he d still be permabanned by kespa
I get and respect your point but it s not looking like people apart from the usual retards are throwing shit at anybody there is just sadness in Life s and SC fans because this could be a catastrophe for the entire scene and because it s hard to imagine that a teenager would get this kind of charge without some kind of legit evidence plus believe me if Life is found innocent his reputation won t be ruined at all people are gonna be SO RELIEVED he would be loved even more than he was before
No Reputations take way longer to fix
Are you calling this a blessing
are you asking seriously ofc being charged can never be a blessing my point is that if there are suspects authorities are supposed to investigate and to some extent in the case of a public figure inform even if this inevitably may raise doubts on someone s reputation Especially as a fan favourite I would expect people continuing loving him if he results innocent in the end that s what I would do myself atleast
https books google com books id uM0eXbCjnWsC lpg PA220 dq south 20korean 20court 20conviction 20rate pg PA220 v onepage q south 20korean 20court 20conviction 20rate f false South Korean courts have a 99 conviction rate The 1 that get off are usually in very odd or unusual cases or where the prosecutors drop the ball Whether or not he s factually innocent if they bring charges he will be convicted Period Call it a corrupt court system that doesn t really believe in innocent until proven guilty or call it a prosecutorial culture that doesn t bring charges unless it knows with complete certainty that it can get a conviction We could have a long debate about the state of Korean courts and their issues or strengths It s also unclear what s going on and whether he s actually been charged Edit He has been charged But one thing is very clear if they do indict him he s going to be found guilty
He was charged according to this tweet You don t arrest someone and charge them if you don t have evidence
He s been arrested There is a 90 something percent conviction rate for this kind of thing and due to how the system works they don t arrest someone unless there s enough to likely convict them They don t arrest suspects Nobody arrests suspects You arrest someone you re going to bring to trial There s a reason why the arrest is the last part of a police drama because that s the guy going to trial Yes he s not been convicted but it s safe to say he will be
They might for a lot of crimes but match fixing or fraud almost never see arrest before a significant case is built up
If he got arrested bro there is probable cause You dont just go arresting people if you are just a suspect Also 500k is nothing and runs out pretty quick
I completely agree and I hope in hell he is found innocent
Keep in mind the police wouldn t just arrest someone for no reason They have enough evidence against him to arrest and charge him Otherwise they wouldn t risk arresting him and potentially having to let him go I find it highly doubtful the police would arrest someone on a serious charge just because Usually the police investigates first then arrest as necessary
one thing s for certain KeSPA is not having huge success in preventing this kind of stuff to happen when sAviOr case happened they were very vocal that despite the damage done a zero tolerance policy was all they needed to prevent corruption from happening guess they were very wrong they should have worked in depth to eradicate bad habits and menaces at the source If it comes out a top SC pro can be easily blackmailed addicted to gambling and stuff it would mean the eSports organizations did not do enough to protect professional scene from these threats I wuould expect atleast some KeSPA representative to admit some kind of responsability for that
Yeah its not Kespa s fault that SC2 is not generating enough revenues for the players to not partake in this type of activities
If Life match fixed pretty much says everything about the state of SC2 in Korea
How so
if even someone perceived as doing very well winning a lot of things feels like he isnt making enough money to justify it then theres something really wrong i mean its possible life is secretly a sociopath and just doing whatever because why the fuck not but assuming hes a normal person he has to have decent motivation to do something bad
Being well paid or paid at all isn t a panacea for match fixing in SC2 or any other sport traditional or otherwise Plenty of high profile match fixing tampering scandals in sports have involved people that were well compensated by most reasonable standards Sure more money may remove the motivation for some people but there s always others Sometimes it s that they feel like they should be making more sometimes they have a gambling habit sometimes they just spent all the money People look at Life and ask why he made so much money No one knows the reality of his financial situation Maybe he spent it all Maybe his parents took it all from him Maybe he got scammed out of it Point is the motivation for match fixing is not as simple as he isn t getting paid enough
If the allegations are true it has nothing to do with him not making enough money to justify it Life made more money than every single Foreigner in sc2 He earned 473 000 in prizemoney plus salary We don t know what he has done with that money but if he needed to matchfix out of financial pressures it s because of his own mismanagement not cause of the Korean scene
except we now know looking back that many of the early top winners gave their winnings to their teams to keep them afloat giving a rosier impression of the korean scene than was real and even then noone thought it was great sure its possible he somehow lost his winnings but its not the only reason why he might do this
match fixing happens in literally every sport the difference is people in esport are way too young and stupid and get caught
thats bullshit In case he did this it was just greed nothing more nothing less He made enough money that he was not forst to do this
Greed is common habit of humans You dont have to be a socipoath or need to be rich or poor or just want a little more
Life made almost 500k dollars by the age of 19 You dont see MC being arrested Fuck it
It says more about the player it has little to do with money and more to do with character
his team managers are likely involved Just like Gerrard in Prime Its very unlikely to be a 1 man thing
Nope since it happens in every sport It s like the recent scandal in tennis and tennis is still a popular sport as far as I know What you say is totally unfounded and the fact that you are getting upvoted is kind of depressing The only thing it shows is the state of esport and match fixing in Korea And I don t think any game is spared
This hurts the game s legitimacy If one of the best players in the world is matchfixing that really hurts SC2 chances of becoming popular
The glory days of SC2 are over dude
He should move to America and continue to play We let famous people get away with stuff all of the time
What confuses me by far the most is that life already made so much cash in winnings Why would he get into match fixing Maybe this entire thing is much bigger than we realize and there is a lot of people behind it that force players into match fixing idk by threatening or w e Ofc that doesnt make it right and im not trying to defend anyone here but I can just see no logical explanation for why a teenager that already makes hundreds of thousands of in earnings would risk his entire life just to make a couple bucks more Even if that was some serious cash I just dont see it being as simple as that edit now that I come to think about it with all the retirements lately in the KR scene maybe this is all related Maybe there is some Players retiring because they feel its the only way out of this who knows
I remember when this happened in BW and thinking At least it won t happen again Really difficult to watch a competition when you have good reason to think it s no longer an actual competition May as well watch pro wrestling or something
Does anyone have any matches that seem fishy or that could be potential evidence anecdotally I mean I can t think of too many matches off the top of my head where Life was beaten or lost in weird ways Maybe he s just that good In a bad way
The one some are pointing to was Life v Solar on Merry Go Round from 2014 Proleague don t know if it is though
The only thing that I can think of that would be remotely suspicious is Life vs Taeja at IEM where he accidentally detonated all his banelings twice It was the 100 000 take all and maybe he thought he wouldn t win the whole thing EDIT Maybe I m thinking of the wrong tournament but point is Life detonating all his banelings multiple times in the series is suspicious
Fuck this
Yay we re a real sport now
According to Korean news sites there was 9 people in total arrested Probably managers and directors that pushed Life to do it Apparently some gang activity had to do with it as some Korean sites are reporting The big thing here is I doubt it was isolated to just Life He was at the top of the starcraft professional scene I m sure others were involved I remember an Innovation vs EDIT SOULKEY finals where Inno went up 3 0 then Soulkey took 4 games with roach all ins while Inno played uncharacteristically poor and never made one tank to hold it This is crazy all this time wasted watching tourneys that likely were majorily fixed
I realize these things makes you question life itself But dont fall in a conspiracy syndrome
There have been some Innovation games in the past with suspicious betting patterns but I hope it s not a case where both were involved I assume multiple top level players fixing with their organisations supporting it would be pretty close to a lethal blow for the Korean scene
jesus guys inno plays a very mechanical style and he doesn t respond well to stuff throwing him off he s an insanely good player mechanically and so people do weird stuff to mindgame him and mess with his head that s the way you beat innovation these speculations are ridiculous a machine like player in a macro game getting thrown off with weird strats under insane pressure MATCH FIXING OMG
exactly its also ridiculous because there is literally zero proof about a fix it was a fucking GSL FINALS and OP didnt even remember that it was soulkey and not life which shows the little research he has actually done on this and instead just spits around blind accusations
Well yeah I see no reason to look at that final since it wasn t even Life playing in it Just saying there was at least one match involving Inno losing in a somewhat weird manner that got pulled from Pinnacle because of the betting patterns Game itself was nowhere near as suspicious the MarineKing game that he s apparently been cleared of throwing intentionally though
That was Inno vs Soulkey
Whatever hes still the best zerg This new genuinely makes me sad but match fixer or not I d watch any game he played in One thing that worries me about esports scenes in countries with big organised crime is that if big money was riding on these results the chances are big criminals may be involved in fixing them Like do we expect 17 year old korean kids to stare down some hardcore gangsters when professional boxers can t
What if you take the money for fixing the match but then play the game normally and do not throw it Wouldn t this be free money What could the people who paid you do to you
guess they could threaten you or your family etc it s not uncommon apparently I remember Crank telling he was being blackmailed in the past by people who wanted him to match fix
That s kinda sick There is literally a fucking Korean Yakuza doing this stuff behind the scenes and they are targeting esports Sounds like something you d see in movies
gambling is huge in Korea I guess you can safely assume that everywhere gambling is big there are criminals thriving with it
They pay you 20K to fix a game and they bet 100K on the other guy because due to the odds they ll win big At that point you re a target You just lost the guy 120K
With the arrest of Life zerg is no longer OP
He had all the tools He had many fans behind his back He has won it all and still doing this If he is guilty man fucking greedy piece of shit
If he is guilty it may not have been because of greed maybe it was take this cash to match fix or your family member is going to have an accident With the people that organise this kind of stuff who knows
So what s the law in Korea Jail or fines They will probably not punish him too harshly but dat criminal record though Hard to get jobs now
They say a man never really knows himself until his freedom s been taken away I wonder how well does he knows himself
eSports isn t a real sport until it has the corruption of field sports
Apocalypse caight match fixing What a scumbag nobody likes him anyway Life gets caught match fixing This is so sad T T I hope he s okay Fuck you reddit
oh no
This is sad man
Oh man
Maybe he got scammed out of financial motivation in life s case
Why just why
FeelsBadMan
So is it all over now
Just wow
Wow I don t really follow sc2 any more but I still remember how exciting Life was to watch play and how fucking amazing he was truly one of the best zergs of all time in sc2 arguably the best This would be crushing if it s true
Sometimes Life sucks but cheer up there will be brighter days
I hardly follow Sc2 anymore and this is crushing news
No Fuck
YOU DUN FUCKED IT UP NOW BOI
noooooooo i am so disappointed
omg this is almost bad as broodwar level
If Life ended up match fixing It must ve been far higher than what he would normally make I guess there s no money in SC2 like there was in BW So much match fixing potentially even from the tournament winners
jesus
idiot
I m a bot bleep bloop Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit r games Ten time premier Starcraft 2 tournament champion Life arrested for match fixing x post r starcraft If you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and don t vote in the other threads Info Contact
Hard to get discriminated
So what forced him into accepting this Was the money just that good Or is eSports really that bad that one of the most prominent korean SC2 players felt the need to take money for a fixed match
Unfortunately the crowd mentality in Korea is very much guilty until proven innocent maybe Many Korean celebrities accused of misdeeds have had their reputations ruined forever even after they were found totally innocent One example off the top of my head was the controversy over Tablo graduating from Stanford
Was hoping Life would be the only player to win the Triple Crown GSL 1 in WoL 1 in HotS 1 in LotV Soo sad now effectively nobody can get this achievementI feel like there really should be a huge discussion about the korean scene as a whole at this point You have to remember that these kids join esport teams before they are adults probably even neglecting any education for the most part They live in the team house training countless hours and don t even get a decent salary unless you are the superstar I am not surprised that such an environment would create matchfixing not saying that ONLY in these circumstances matchfixing is a problem but it certainly helps Obviously in Life s case this doesn t fit the picture but if we believe other statements Rekrul some foreign progamers there is a lot more shady stuff going on beyond the surface Nobody ever talks about the questionable enviroment though i feel that should change Maybe i misrepresent the whole thing with this post if i do so pls correct me but that s what i feel atm
This probably has a whole hell of a lot more to do with Korean society in general than it does with just the Starcraft 2 scene The fact that illegal gambling rings can operate so boldly says a lot Life could lose his entire career loads of his earnings and will probably have a tough future ahead of him Where is the talk about the brokers and the gangsters facilitating this to happen so frequently and so blatantly Children are frequently offered thousands of dollars by adults and the children who accept lose everything As a side note life is only 19 years old Did you understand what 500k meant when you were that age Also he s still living in a team house in less than ideal conditions for a normal life so it s not like he s living the life of someone earning 100k year That money must be so abstract to him if he even still has it
I don t know about Korean culture specifically but in most Asian cultures it s expected common that you pay back your parents in one way or another Depending on how much you earn it s pretty much a given that you pay some sort of allowance to them until you re married I d be surprised if most progamers didn t pass along a large portion of their earnings winnings to their parents I don t think Life kept the 500K for himself
It s a given Look at MC MVP and all the big name players What do they do with all that money Goes straight to their parents or at least a significant chunk of it Here in America yeah it s a lot more about me me me mo money mo money mo money But in Korea the respect towards your elders is deeply ingrained The culture is enormously different and something I dare say many Americans wouldn t really understand
Illegal stuff happens all over the world man You can t blame korea for having a illegal gambling scene It s entirely Life s fault that he decided he wants to be a part of it
So your point is that they shouldn t bother trying to improve conditions or go after the illegal gambling rings I assume this just means gangsters because it s entirely up to 19 year old life to push away their demands for his entire career Great
I m not saying they shouldn t fight against illegal gambling rings Just that it s 100 Life s fault and not theirs Let s take the war on drugs as an example Gouverments are fighting them but it s just not as easy as you make it seem And yeah it s the fault of a 19 year old if he decides to take drugs and not the dealers gouverments edit Actually players like Life are the ones that create the illegal matchfixing scene Not the other way around And it s not because progamers have a a hard life Life is a superstar and probaly made more money than any other 19 year old It was pure greed that lead Life into the illegal scene
You don t have any insights in the case How can you get to such conclusions We know nothing about the case we don t know If they preasured him into doing the match fixing At this point we are in no position to put all the blame on someone the whole thing too complex to be put down this easy I don t know anything about the gangs u Throwawayaccount 047 is writing about And I don t think that the Korean administration is NOT fighting them
Illegal gambling is just one of those things which seems to come hand in hand with organised crime It is an assumption but one based on examples from many other countries and of course wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki Crime in South Korea
You don t understand u throwawayaccount 047 s point It s hard to put all the blame on someone who probably doesn t really understand how much 400k really is because he lived all his young adult life in a gaming house and have not known what living alone paying for your stuff is like It s also the State s concern that its population doesn t turn into criminals or in this case illegal gamblers or match fixing athletes It s not their responsability if it happens but it becomes theirs too when they let it happen
I honestly disagree I think we re probably both American and grew up with totally different environmental and societal pressures on us The choice was less his than it would have been ours had it been offered to us in America at that age
I m sure when the full details come out we ll hear about the others involved Remember the whole Prime thing In the full report it mentioned the people involved that weren t from the sc2 scene and they got punished pretty hard I think The community will obviously focus on the sc2 players involved but I don t think it s correct to say that people aren t talking about the gangsters that are involved
where did that large number even come from
we actually can t tell how the match fixing is done how s the approach on the players what pressure they receive what promises are told I don t know man for guys like Yoda and BB I kinda understand easy money easy way but Life
My point is that the korean scene seems kinda shady even without matchfixing if you think about it Kids join proteams and don t even get a decent salary for it I mean you could argue that they get exploited In Life s case this is less of a motivation because he is a big superstar in the context of sc2 but overall i can definitely see WHY some of these guys feel the need to earn some extra money The whole scene doesn t feel stable and respectable when you look at it this way As i said i am sorry if i misrepresent the environment somebody with more knowledge someone closer to it can definitely correct me
We can even look into other countries in that region when it comes to practise environments This things is Not a esport thing I would more say its more of a Hierarchy where young minds become products of persons with interests extreme example but point made
Well i am not saying this is exclusive to korean esport but i hardly see anyone discussing it Which is wrong imo
What would you want to achieve with talking about it Just curious
I simply think it s always better to discuss problems instead of sweeping it under the mat It probably won t change anything though i get that
go play some sc2 sc2 community nah too stressful i just watch
Well said Chobra StarCraft is a wonderful lovely thing and it s disappointing to see all the bad news and negative vibes lately
It is a lovely game But for those who wish to view it as a career it is indubitable that this news will weigh heavily on whatever few that is
Guys do we have Brendan Dassey in custody Can we pin this one on him too Just this once
We have statements like this but we are still not sure if Life is really guilty or not Am I right
He s been brought in by the official police It s very very likely he ll be convicted
esports police Constable Artosis
Kespa has investigated match fixing before by themselves this is far more serious
I hope so he s my favorite player and has been for years
Same here hope he comes out clean however unlikely it may be starting to seem
There isnt a big reason for that hope At the moment he is at the same spot as 4B and Yoda They havent been at a curt when we all called them matchfixers but a prosecutor had enough evidence to bring it to court and KESPA called them out 98 of the prosecutors files are won in front of courts Life is in prison the evidence must be really solid or else you dont get arrested and treated like that in Korea There is a reason why statements like this are brought But just like Yoda and 4B the evidence is so pressuring that he sits in prison and looks very grim It is the right moment for such statements even they wount help in the decline
It s B4 not 4B
Doesn t matter Kespa have a 0 tolerance policy on this The moment you are arrested you can t participate any Kespa sanctioned event
I m glad chobra wrote this I certainly needed to read it I m glad he s still active in the scene
It s not like he died lol
He may as well have
ma bonjwa is dead to me
Even tho I know that he s right I still feel horrible about this sAviOr used to be one of my favorite players back then and this strikes an awfully familiar note Right now I just want to cry Life heh will go on but not right now
Yeah it s kind of retarded how some people say it shows the state of the scene I mean there is this kind of scandal everywhere in every large sport or esport It s sad but it happens The issue is that this kind of situation seem to happen more often in Korea
right on Chobra
I m sure when the full details come out we ll hear about the korean scene as a whole at this point
Good read Gonna hit that ladder New Season hype
I wish he had something interesting to say
It s kind of brilliant actually Life always wins except when he deliberately loses
I m not caught by shock and awe about this news and it s not cause I always suspected Life It s just simply that it can happen to anyone How the fuck can it happen to anyone To get caught Or to be a match fixer
Both Match fixing exists in esports way more than we actually know Very few get caught though
My point was that it can t happen to anyone And it s absurd to say it can It besides the point how much get caught because if you don t accept the bribe you will not be in a position to get caught And to absolve Life with a saying it can happen to anyone is that real life pun intended
if you don t accept the bribe you will not be in a position to get caught Maybe the people offering the bribe dont take no for an answer if you know what I mean They are hardly playing by the law kind of guys in the first place
The point isn t to absolve him If he s innocent he ll be back If he s guilty then he s gone and will be penalized accordingly There s no need to dwell on him just move on
There have been various match fixing incidents in different games SC2 is hard to matchfix on because you have to do it for cash in other more popular games kappa you can bet skins and various items therefore getting a quick reward You can do it in many ways without ever getting caught One very popular incident that happened was the IbuyPower controversy in CS GO Google it It s just one of the many that have happened and yet very little have been found because it s incredibly easy to cover your tracks when you re match fixing The only reason that incident went public is because an angry ex gf of a player spilled the beans on twitter about it all If it was not for her we would ve never known
Watch a movie Build a snowman Go to the beach
he always suspected Life uhh
This reads like he always suspected Life but that s not the reason he isn t caught in shock and awe I am no native speaker though so maybe i am wrong Either way he surely didn t mean it that way

I don t think that s how he meant itr starcraft has a message for me
3 thank you for being a good sport about it
I know right he s pretty much Football Would suck if he was a bad sport like basketball
When you don t have anything meaningful to say in an internet debate you can always default to finding fault in your opponents grammar Stay classy Reddit
I don t think pointing out a glaring spelling error in a post is defaulting to finding grammar issues lol It s also not entering into a internet debate whenever you comment on a meme post

You must contrust additional pylong
You learnt a valuable lesson today OP Always proofread your graphics
contrust constructing with trust in the grand executor DK
Contrust
Kontrust is a weird European metal band
Weird You mean AWESOME
I said weird in an approving tone in my head
Sounds like a European Maximum the Hormone
This is like launching a rocket when the countdown hits 4
That s what NASA did with Challenger
So david kim needs more templars
High ones yes
We ll need to stock up on vespene gas and marijuana
Khalajuana

contrust
God damn if he didnt try though
Typos gets more hits
The heroes we don t deserve
LOTV is the first SC game I didn t buy on release day Still haven t bought it
Don t ask what David Kim can do for you ask what you can do for David Kim
Well maybe people are sick of saying NERF PYLON OVERCHARGE for like 3 months now
i dont think pylon overcharge is even OP i just think it is a silly game mechanic same for tankvacs i feel like theyre changes youd make in an arcade map for fooling around theyre just so ridiculous
I ve heard there s a new terrain unit with a mop and cleaner that walks around and cleans up creep but then the floor is slippery so Marines can t walk on it
Not nerf remove
Precisely the kind of retarded crap we must contrust against
sounds like non contrusive feedback
eh I dunno I think it has a place and it helps protoss deal with harassment which they really struggled with before It just shouldn t be able to defend any attack before the 20 minute mark Weaken it and make it less spammy
They need to nerf that OR adepts not both This just makes toss early game shit again
You mean to tell me not being able to expand and having to spend gas on sentries while terran and zerg safely expand and harass with tier 1 units wasn t ideal
oh no do you have to build units to defend your expansion why cant pylons just do it all
Why can t stalkers cost 50 minerals with tier 1 upgrades that make them 2x 3x as good
Because a stalker is way way stronger than a marine
David Kim has the patience of a saint There s no way I could deal with the 1000 s of gold league heroes thinking they understand the game and know EXACTLY what needs to be changed
I want you To take balancing seriously Edit This thread is 100 separate from the balance feedback So the comment that has points below me makes no sense whatsoever This was also a joke SC2 reddit is unreal
You are one of the people whose feedback is so uncontrustive that you only make the job harder
Whoosh
How does that make any sense at all when I am not even giving feeback on any of the balance changes This thread has nothing to do with the feedback for the game whatsoever so what are you actually getting at And obviously my comment was a joke
Your post implied that he doesn t take balancing seriously It was a clear and direct criticism of David Kim ergo it was a criticism of his balance changes along the line of You aren t taking the changes you make seriously Unless you intended it differently in which case you should have written it differently
It was a joke that wasn t even near the feedback thread or post Get real
If you don t understand what you yourself say then don t say it
Take a joke Stop taking things so seriously It s just the internet Don t worry about what I said D
I wish the mods banned dumbfucks like you from this subreddit

Can you rewrite this in English please
No new maps for you
What uncostructive feedback he is talking about Sorry not following the game lately But when I was leaving Kim had kind of shitty reputation and it wasn t completely undeserved Does that changed
You weren t listening to us back in 2010 Our patience has ended Hope you re happy what you did to our game Because we aren t
Hey David what about analyzing DATA as hard evidence instead of listening to peoples rant Yunno doing your job
Should have gone with Alarak and been more assertive
Well it s not like Blizz is doing anything we expect them to do like new maps leave league bugs other stuff blizz promised
Honestly they should be thrilled that they re getting so much free feedback regardless of positive negative Some businesses have to pay a fortune to understand customer sentiment and DK s team get it for free then complain about it If they don t have the infrastructure in place to filter it and separate signal from noise and or it s causing poor morale that s entirely the responsibility of their management teams not the customer s problem Insinuating that their recent minimal efforts to have some dialogue with the community aka transparency are to fault for unrealistic expectations and not the fact that Blizzard themselves hyped these features is laughable Asking the community of paying customers to lay off on their harmful internet words was pathetic and frankly just came off as more PR intended to obfuscate the fact that Blizzard s focus isn t really on this game although they continue to pay it lip service If what we re seeing really represents the efforts of a full team I don t know what to say The right response when your customers complain en masse is to say that you totally understand where the complaints are coming from will make every effort to expedite changes the community wants but make no guarantees and then proceed in the best way forward for the business after understanding the cost benefit of addressing the user complaints ahead of your slated development calendar Unfortunately it looks like Blizzard s cost benefit analysis is consistently falling on the side of less investment in SC2 but taking passive aggressive shots at the community is weak regardless
He is the worst thing to ever happen to starcraft
Why is that As someone who doesn t follow this very closely I d be interested to read a nice write up
Oh Fuck off
He hasn t had a mind for balance in a decade He made a few good suggestions in sc1 but that s it
you re not mildly funny you re completely unfunny
I actually found that quite funny
I wish i had a job where i ask other people to do it for me
