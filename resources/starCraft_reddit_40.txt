They should allow people to submit coop maps to be played Kind of like Super Mario Maker P
The feasible way to do it would be some sort of a template for making co op missions in the arcade
That kind of already exists A mod exists that is able to be downloaded within the editor that contains all the data and shared triggers alongside a bunch of template triggers for objectives There s not really anything stopping anyone from building a new co op mission right now
Are you sure The Campaign Dependecie doesn t contain the Co Op assets For example Swann s Turrets and Zagara s Scourge Nest aren t in it If you know how to find it please tell me I didn t but maybe I m looking at the wrong place
But we also want the commanders and all their abliities spear of adun void thrashers etc
http imgur com GHHJPp6 Seriously all that stuff is in there already That s what I m talking about when I say shared triggers I believe the trigger that actually detects what level your hero is uses a Blizzard only function but there s a custom UI hero selector written into it that you can load at the beginning of the map where you can pick your hero and his level You can even select Karax in it though it does nothing Haven t gone through it with a fine tooth comb to ensure all the stuff is 100 as rendered in retail but an awful lot is in there
Oh awesome thanks for finding this
Well that s basically the arcade They would need to create super dumbed down editor if they want casuals to be able to design levels which is harder for a game like starcraft
I love coop it would be awesome to see more varietys of scenarios
Coop maps need to be opened up to map makers with some sort of quality control on it
I do not thing every map should be available Otherwise there will be some cheater maps Lots of xp by walking your units 5cm to the west The best would be some kind of contest like the TL map contest And the winner gets in the official pool and gets something For example a little note you see in the loading screen Map by XYZ Other Projects Awesome cool acrade map Win win for everbody The best map makers have a reason to do this little project so they get free advertisement for their other projects More people look into the arcade The Coop player get high quality maps Blizzard will be praised for being community friendly and gets content for free ok they have to organize the whole thing and judge it I just assume this is less work then making the maps
Seeing a lot of responses to threads I ve seen on here and team liquid Really great to see That bunker change idea literally came out in the middle of the sandisk invitational cast
It s clear blizzard reads r starcraft
This sub is a much more open and even more pleasant place since Blizzard ramped up the feedback communication this year It s amazing The sub and places like TL provide better feedback knowing it will be heard and Blizzard spends their time more effectively Well done
We absolutely do I think many people severely underestimate how much content we read We always appreciate when people put in the time and effort to write out detailed thoughts or opinions While this is a new blog we ve seen many of these points brought up before and have discussed them with development We know these requests are important to the community and we re always looking to make sure that hot topics such as these are given the appropriate amount of attention internally With development ongoing for Legacy of the Void there are still a lot of discussions taking place As such we may not be able to jump into topics with definitive answers on feature requests but we still want to let you know that the request is heard and will be discussed
I remember someone was bitching about blizzard not listening to people here and one of the community managers replied to it Apparently they read EVERYTHING but only reply to a small fraction That is quite consistent with the amount of community suggestions that get added without any discussion from blizzard on the subject
What s the bunker idea I haven t seen the description anywhere
Neosteel becoming an individual upgrade for a bunker rather than a passive upgrade
What s the neo steel passive upgrade I play Zerg sorry never heard
It just bumps the bunker capacity from 4 to 6 Almost no one gets it though It s too costly and pushes other upgrades from the engineering bay back for too long to be worth it
Has this always been in the game I ve never seen anyone use it to my knowledge and I ve been playing sc2 at a high diamond masters level since WoL launch This is sad to me if that s the case
Yeah it s almost completely unheard of Especially in the higher skill bracket And what s worse is that there is no possible way that you have seen it and just didn t notice on account of the obvious remodel the bunker gets
Bunker have 2 extra slots for units to get it 2 more marines or 1 more marauder and a normal cc and pf have 5 more slots for workers to jump in
To be fair I don t think anyone has actually seen it be used
I think I saw Nate get it once
I think either individual upgrades or combining neosteel with building armor would be fun
The neosteel upgrade suggestion was given before beta ended I don t remember who did it but a bunch of people thought it was a good idea No idea why blizzard didn t try it out
Siege Tanks just need a straight up damage boost The solution to the units problems seem to avoid making it better at its main role which is to park somewhere and say to the opponent come at me bro
Fully agree for comparison the ravager corrosive bile does 60 splash damage Let s think about that Compare the ravager against the siege tank which does 35 light 50 armored damage It just highlights how horribly bad the unit is
But the ravager spell is easily dodged has smaller splash and has a cd If it was a smart target autocast without a ground marker I d agree with you
Ravager also moves very fast doesn t need to get into a siege mode and is way easier to mass
Comparing corrosive bile and siege tank damage is unproductive They are apples and oranges For one thing seige tanks hit 100 of the time Corrosive bile hits probably less than 50 against a good player depending on what the main targets are
buff dmg and put back in research
I can t believe they want to nerf the siege tank to make mech viable lol Maybe in TvT but seriously did they completely give up on mech in tvp and tvz Do this change but please buff the tank in some way pleas Viper Ultra Broodlord adrenaline glance adepts carriers spread out Economy disruptor faster creepspread all these changes are horrible for mech while mech only got the tankivac and the cyclone as buffs for mech and the tankivac now might fall
They didn t say they wouldn t buff it elsewhere
Hellow everybody i wanted to give my opinion concerning mech tvt drop tank I think that mech is really bad right now for two reason The first one is that lotv is obviously way more dynamic when it comes to expanding as a mech player you always need alot of turret and a big army around 170 pop to secure a 4th base quite safely on lotv the timing of the 4th is way earlier than this supply cap this reason is already a big buff to bio play for the whole game when it will come to expand even more bio will have the advantage obviously but for air transition it will be also be a big deal right The second one is that in the past you had to scout well and adapt to the mech air army making tech lab to kill the ground with banshee or some reactor to take back heavily air control with viking since lotv you just have to make some reactor and you will be able to kill mech army ground air with viking liberator and just finish the game if your opponent have a big air army since the start he wont be able to expand and take control of the game So drop tank in my opinion almost doesn t affect bio vs mech at all your idea that it helps escaping from big fight with your tank is not realistic everytime you fight as mech vs bio tank u ll have the viking advantage and will kill every medic that will try to come close to the fight Concerning tvt bio vs bio it gives a really weird dynamic but i dont have an opinion yet concerning that maybe it s giving good game maybe not we will see Bunker upgrade great idea finally take care of not giving us something too strong Balance overall doesnt look bad especially with this really weird and probably bad map pool most pro think that zerg is too good vs protoss Co op missions are awesome i really think you should give us really hardcore brutal missions and a way bigger range of mission anyway 15 20 to start maybe Give us skin
This is exactly right The medivac tank drops are the LEAST important factor contributing to bio s dominance against mechanized play With mech you almost always have a complement of vikings to catch drops and prevent marauder marine bombs on your tank line If you pick up your tanks as the bionic player you will always loose one or two tankivacs from a viking missile volley Its just better to unsiege them and move away The economy changes are the biggest reason for the weakness pure factory starport builds in TvT The ability to defend your 4th 5th and 6th bases as the mechanized player is extremely difficult with the bio player s map dominance and ability to take bases With mech in the late game you ll always be one to two bases behind with almost no way of harassing them thanks to PF s As the bio player you can even drop tank production entirely when playing against mechanized Terran and instead go for liberators viking battle cruisers combined with fast air upgrades Mech will be behind in air upgrades and will have less gas to contribute to air control
Thought the same on Medivac Tank affecting Mech Blizz please look elsewhere not everyone want to see another Roach v Roach 2 0 in LotV
What was the bunker upgrade thing again
Neosteel frame Currently you can invest some cash in the engineering bay The problem is that Ebays should be used for upgrades on priority That makes the other upgrades have to wait until 3 3 is done which essentially makes them useless The suggestion Players were saying that the upgrade should require certain tech like engineering bay but then the bunker itself can be upgraded to have neosteel plating for an individual cost It might affect bunker rushes in the early game but it will certainly help terran hold a third base against rava roach timings as well as some of protoss shenanigans EDIT I should probably mention that neosteel frame allows 2 extra spaces on the bunker That means 3 marauders or 6 marines It s a pretty nice upgrade but committing 100gas and 110 sec not sure in lotv time to get the upgrade AND delay your upgrades Just isn t worth it in its current form If its like a 25 25 upgrade on an individual bunker it would probably worth it
Sounds like a pretty good change
It does sound like it would help terrans hold against early ravager pushes although the meta should start shifting towards opening with tanks instead of liberator But I m also worried about the impact it will have on bunker rushes
bunker rushes are already much weaker compared to hots and if you need to upgrade the bunker and have an ebay it would be very hard to use it so eary in the game
Tanks vs roach ravager isn t good at all Tanks aren t that great vs roach until you hit crit number although it is great at softening them up but usually you have 1 maybe 2 tanks by time roach ravager timing hits Ravager is non armored and doesnt take bonus from tanks The answer for ravager timings are banshees not tanks Tanks are sitting ducks vs ravagers and simply isn t powerful enough
Exceptthe slot upgrade does nothing helpful at all A few ravager shot will still kill the bunker quickly Then you lose 6 rines instead of just 4 Maybe the armor upgrade will help
This is awesome feedback I m glad they aren t addressing the balance whine yet and are focusing on issues that they perceive as design issues that s exactly the correct mindset to have in the offseason after a new expansion was released Good job Blizzard As for the feedback itself I do think TvT would be more interesting if tanks unsiege on load because right now we don t get to see positional tank lines at all they re basically being used like Reavers in Shuttles If there was at least a soft incentiev to not pick up your tanks then you d have to actually think about where you siege up
Also you could pick up two tanks at once
co op missions should be like Greater Rifts get harder and harder forever Higher and higher levels would force a transition to tier 3 units I can beat brutal co op by massing 3 3 zealot dragoon OK it taught me how to macro success Teach me how to transition now Before you know it a good do op player is now ready for 1v1 D
Fix for the Tank issue Introduce an upgrade with Armory requirement that lowers the siege time to 1 5 seconds That way one of the coolest additions of LotV stays in the game and it restores the importance of positioning in TvT because even if unsieged the better positioned player will get the first volley off Also it would make the Tank more viable vT P and potentially serve as an alternative to Liberators
As a Terran player I actually have to agree with you I would rather have the tank be strong enough to warrant its slow pace so that when you actually siege a line your opponent can t attack into it without a good flank Unfortunately it seems that medivac drops have kind of killed the idea of the tank being a strong positional unit in exchange for having it be more micro intensive and mobile I just think that the same concerns about overpowered tanks from WoL don t apply anymore with all of the tools available now to combat them they were never good vs Protoss and Zerg now has ultras ravagers and vipers that pretty heavily counter tank play I would prefer if tanks could actually defend a position while seiged like how liberators currently work rather than having added mobility through drops Maybe I am wrong but I think the way it stands there s no real reason to use tanks over liberators atm
It s amazing but it also takes a shitload of attention and micro It has one of the biggest downsides which is I can t do much else while I do this Still I think players rely on it as a crutch if it is effective propping up their harass despite not being better than their opponents I d much rather the tanks unseiged when they came out
yeah i see nothing wrong with pickup of a sieged tank this is really good change in some ways Dropping it in a presieged state does create that odd interaction about mobile mech and bio they point out
Also without medic Tank can be easily killed by Ravager But pick up tank in TvT is ridiculous
On the other hand the other player doesn t get to do anything either except match the micro of that tank It just stagnates the match for both players because they both need to stay highly focused on it
And with Blizzard map design there s always places to drop a tank that you really can t do much about
Another Terran checking in I have disliked the picking up of sieged tanks since they put it in It just looks ridiculous Yea it is a very strong feature for certain scenario s but I d rather they thought of more logical solutions A similar arguement can be said about the healing of hellbats I mean why not just put in the Firebat then
You need to realize that the terran who s spending all that time microing that siege tank drop is gonna be banking up minerals gas It is not a totally costless thing to do Also you re aware the drop was nerfed The siege tank isn t allowed to fire for 2 seconds after being dropped Stephano kinda had that problem solved even during the beta right click the group of lings on the dropshop so the tank can never land Focus your queens on the dropship Tank drops kinda suck vs zerg Tank drops to be honest have fallen out of vogue these days It s not seen in TvT anywhere near where it was during beta and even if it is an old school marine hellion drop does far more damage It s just sad when a tank drop is countered by a single viking and we Terrans all know this so we just kinda stopped doing tank drops
Less micro Tanks medivacs need to be babysat
Once again this is not a few zealots You need to actively chase the vac tank down You just send some units over I am going to say thanks pick up move and land again and shell the unattended units that are now just standing there Also people who think medivac tank is apm intensive baffle me It is just like reaver shuttle and is not difficult at all
It s not difficult in isolation but when you try to combine it with other micro macro it becomes very complicated
Which is the same for the person defending which is why its a moot point If you are playing against anyone who knows what they are doing the attention you have to give to defending it is normally just as taxing as the person using it
Say thanks pick up move and land again is pretty apm intensive compared to just actively chase the vac tank down no Once again this is not a few zealots Tank drop is not a few zealots ruby where you can drop the zealot and do something else Yeah its not difficult at all but also not more difficult than defending against it Yeah you might lose some units but for a tank and maybe a med vac that s a juicy target On an open field I d sac 10 lings to get a tank no problem I will still be happy Oh and the tank don t even one shot a worker
Except the defender only need to right click ling stalker viking cyclone on the vac if you see it while the dropper need to babysit the vac and the tank Defending a single tank drop harass is not hard Its the doom drop marine tank push mass tank drop scenarios in TvT that is where tank drop becoming the problem
Lmao it not a zealot run by you can not just a click units over there and go do something else If you just a move some units over to me and go do something else you are going to lose all of those units and I will still be shelling your base
I think it is still a good idea for the tanks to drop unseiged which makes the current type of play less viable IE pushing with medivac marine and dropping the tanks when you get close The Bastetrade TVT tournament was pretty much entirely that one tactic
I would put your upgrade in the tech lab call it Swift Siege lowering the siege time to 1 5 seconds and giving tanks the ability to get pick up by medivacs That way mech can move around faster and bio has to invest in that option to be able to pick up siege tanks We had to research Siege mode for years anyway I don t think it would hurt to give tanks an upgrade again Oh and while we re at it why not add Maelstrom rounds from the Co op in the tech lab
This is a good idea I d rather the tank not having to rely on another unit to make it viable That or just straight up buff the tank damage to solidify its role as a positional damage dealer EDIT also can Blizz clarify if the 2 sec delay stays even after the unsieged change It s stupid for unsiege tank to wait 2 sec before firing
nah I think they shuold keep the siege time being able to rescue tank with medivac is enough of buff in mobility department Instead they should make the tank itself stronger when sieged I mean whole point of siege tank is to have firepower in exchange of total mobility Right now it has neither
I like it a late game upgrade that stops the early harass maintains tank lines most of the game and allows for an upgrade that shifts the game later
Maybe helps v ultras lategame
That s a very huge maybe The ultras would still close distance and when they do you would need to hot pickup the tanks stim your army kite the ultras backward and reposition the tanks and wait out the 2 second delay before they re allowed to fire again I still don t see tanks being a viable solution unless some more fundamental changes are made regarding cost supply etc
Tanks are not good versus ultras
Not nearly enough ultras are laughably broken vs T atm
I like this I would go even further and just say we should just lower the siege time requirement in general to make them more viable in all matchups and retain positioning benefits Then maybe force them to unsiege when picked up by a medivac The reason for the across the board buff in my eyes is that mech being a viable composition requires that the tank be the bread and butter of the army and right now I m just not sure that is possible
This needs more visibility
This this this million times this over the drop wars thas happening right now
I don t even think it needs to be an upgrade The siege tank needs some serious help period Whether it be a single target direct damage upgrade reduced siege time or a modest combination of both While we re at it the viking transformation time is ridiculously unnecessary and should be looked at Battles are over so fast that it just simply needs to be more responsive
Changes should be aimed at strengthening the strengths and weaknesses of units If the medivac thing forces us to keep reducing the siege tank s weakness it ll no longer be an interesting unit
about the burrow issue why not give the players the OPTION TO CHOOSE and since they seem to be fixing smaller issues now how about fixing one thing morphing a mothershipcore which is not at full HP into a mothership results in a mothership that does not have full HP Sometimes you need to kill your own mothershipcore before morphing it into a mothership because of this stupid thing Even a 1hp corrupter will result in a full hp broodlord
As you say it s a small issue but I think you re probably right
Revert the siege tank to greatness http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Siege Tank Heart of the Swarm Patch Changes increase life from 150 to 160 if overkill is implemented siege mode damage changed from 35 15 armoured to 60 70 if overkill is implemented siege mode upgrade damage changed from 3 2 armoured to 4 5 if overkill is implemented attack cooldown increased from 2 8 to 3 0 i e takes longer note these are old Blizzard time seconds unsieges upon medivac pickup If a nerf is necessary first look into increasing the attack cooldown Reducing life can come second but keep its high damage A strong siege tank is awesome and makes it a unique unit
Returning overkill to the Siege Tank would be huge
70 flat damage is just plain ridiculous
Something that is often overlooked is that Starcraft 1 had a size based damage model Since Siege tanks did explosive damage that was reduced by 50 against small units and reduced by 25 against medium sized units but full damage vs shields If you were to try to translate this to Starcraft 2 s siege tank the closest you d get would be something like 35 15 vs armored 20 vs shields 15 vs massive with overkill
The size based thing ultimately meant all the sorts of units we think of today as armored dragoons ultralisks tanks took full damage I d be happy with 35 35 vs armored The shields thing has already been compensated for by the lower health pool of virtually all toss units
While you re translating BW stats to SC2 might as well as give storm back the 112 damage
Exactly That s why 70 plain damage is bonkers
cost increase would need to be made for those stats
Overkill What s that
http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Definitions O Basically SC2 tanks have smart fire no overkill so only the exactly number of siege tank shots to kill a unit are fired For BW tanks all possible shots are taken so all of the tanks will be on attack cooldown where they have to wait to shoot a different unit https www youtube com watch v cIDixqI0ycU
Oh man Here we go again with the bunker changes
I m down for another wild ride I think watching zergs defend proxy rax is my favorite cheese
Bunker build time decreased by 5s Neural parasite ranged reduced to 7
That s some good positive feedback Thumbs up Blizzard
I do not know if I like this change design wise but in tvp and tvz this will decrease the tank use even more Mech gets weaker and weaker Viper Ultra Broodlord adrenaline glance adepts carriers spread out Economy disruptor faster creepspread all these changes are horrible for mech while mech only got the tankivac and the cyclone as buffs for mech and the tankivac now might fall So why would anyone do anything else than bio sad times for terran imo
The Starbow design is like that as well pick up a sieged tank and it unloads in tank mode It doesn t allow for any really fanciful siege tank kiting but as everyone has already said fanciful good especially in combination with the medivac It might be more prudent to remove something so powerful which makes the siege tank so well rounded and removes its main weakness
And make the unit nearly worthless in every other matchup I hope they will not do that And if they do I d like to see them at least having 7 range in tank mode or something
Uh They do have 7 range in tank mode
Well I dont know about you but I am using tanks quite regularly in the other matchups right now And I probably still would if I could pick them up sieged to drop unsieged behind my army to save them
You ok you might use them but i saw no tanks in any lotv tournament And if there were some they were always used with medivacs If you know mech pro games please link me
They have 7 range in tank mode They ll outrange a bunker filled with nothing but marines
How will it make it worthless in every other match up
Tanks will only be used in TvT In HotS we would see an occasional TvZ mech game where tanks were used but even those are disappearing Mech is weaker than it s ever been
Wasn t every zerg and his mother bitching about mech TvZ at the end of HotS
For a month or two then it got sort of figured out Majority of the late GSL SSL games and Blizzcon games were bio Plus in LotV mech isn t as good because they nerfed ravens added ebola cloud ravagers and the economy makes turtle play much worse I don t think the best terran mech army can even beat viper broodlord corruptor Maybe with ghosts
ebola cloud
Parasitic bomb that aoe air to air spell
You heard him right
Maybe but forum whiners aren t exactly the wisest about balance If mech was as strong as some said we would ve seen it far more often in pro games The pros use whatever gives them the greatest chance if victory which in TvZ happens to be bio
Pros were destroying every one with it too
What does destroying everyone mean statistically If it wasn t a higher win percentage than bio then it s meaningless
Only innovation has great success with mech who has always been favoring mech in TvT and TvZ pre swarm host And even then he has to mix in bio play because Meching every times just screams kill me with 2 bases all in Maru tried mech and he lost horribly Byul Rogue also decimates mech players that is not innovation
good source please do not discuss on that level It is quite obvious that in the current state of LotV tanks will be obsolete in any mid to lategame Especially without tankivac micro Not to even speak about tvp Everyone who knows anything about the game knows tanks suck dick in LotV even more than ever adepts carriers tempests major warpprism buffs even disruptors and the more spread out economy it should be quite obvious
It s not even really used in TvT anymore I m not seeing it anywhere near the level it was during beta A single viking is all that s required to counter the early tank harass kinda sad and all the more so that the sieged tank isn t allowed to fire for 2 seconds upon landing
It would also make XvT a lot more fun too I m all for this change
Yea it s kind of a joke right now almost feel like an open game server where retarded sht is allowed
Bunker change hype
Sounds like we managed to make Davie proud Good job Screddit
All I really want for COOP right now is to increase the game speed
F2 will no longer select Disruptor shots SC2 a game for casuls confirmed s
just for protoss
it s always been pretty casual for protoss Kappa
I for one am proud I didn t know that was an issue

I thought Adepts were declared the new Bunkers during the beta
Reddit where references take the place of humor
Parasitic bomb needs to be nerfed The closest comparison to this spell is Irradiate from brood war Irradiate did not stack and had to be researched Science vessel were more expensive than vipers and it did not have consume to rapidly gain energy Despite this it was still an extremely strong ability pretty much shutting down muta play the moment its researched Whats even crazier is that brood war didn t have smart casting while sc2 does The graphical indicator on parasitic bomb need to be clearer as well Its very difficult compared to irradiate to tell with unit the spell is on
If they nerf the damage to PB I think they would need to add an active silence to it Essentially anything in the PB cannot cast spells This keeps it as the anti free energy unit that it needs to be
I don t really understand how stronger siege tanks lead to stronger bio in the situation he mentioned But then again I m a scrub
Bio in this case is marines medivacs and tanks as opposed to mech which is primarily factory starport units Because you are building medivacs for healing your marines anyway and you aren t making as many tanks as a mech player a lot of the time you can pick up all your tanks in siege mode Your army is only as fast as its slowest unit If you can pick up all your tanks then your army is only as slow as your marines Meanwhile mech still has to siege and unsiege the old fashioned way Even if they use some medivacs to carry their tanks they never have enough for all of them Before mech was slow but it had the power of siege tanks Now mech is still slow but bio also has the power of siege tanks
Oh okay then its just an issue of naming that confused me I guess I was still in HOTS thinking where bio was the 4M and including tanks made it bio mech
Mobility via medvacs makes the tank way way more mobile and sustains the firepower of tanks which is what makes mech strong iiiin the first place Bio simply out does mech in its current form
I find it frustrating to read Mech has bigger problems than simply tank drops Its just insanely difficult to defend expansions The new economy forces you to spread out so much and you just can t defend it with your handful of units The Bio player can reposition himself quickly at strike at different bases before you re set up The constant need for expansions exposes you to massive drops I ve never felt like flying tanks are what stop Mech If anything is stopping Mech it s the lack of a strong space control Tanks are fairly weak in small groups You just can t defend expansions very well Marauders quickly swoop in and blow shit up or drops run laps around your army Liberators have also changed the dynamics by allowing Bio a solid way to force unsieges if they happen to gain air control Their proposed change won t do anything to Mech but it will hurt bio How is a bio player supposed to deal with the enhanced Roach Hydra composition without flying tanks RoachHydra is a billion times stronger in legacy of the void than it ever was it heart of the swarm And the only thing Bio gained to deal with it is flying tanks You only survive as a Bio player vs RoachHydra because you can reposition tanks back as bile shots and units come in If they come out unsieged then how is a Bio player suppose to deal with bile Do we just give up as soon as bile is fired or units get close to the tanks and run home Then how do you win vs RoachHydra as Bio It s just a bad change If they go through with it than it will hurt Bio more than make Mech viable I think their attempts at remaking Reaver like game play with flying tanks has been a major failure Tank drops are hardly viable Every race can counter them relatively easily with air The firing delay gives an incredible response time for non air based comps They don t do very much damage compared to other harassment methods They also require an incredible amount of attention for the low reward And the firing delay gives the opponent an incredible Blizzard seems incredibly hesistant to give the tank some real firepower I would like for them to try dropping the flying tanks and just give tanks a straight damage boost That way Mech can be stronger and Bio can continue to deal with RoachHydra
while we are at the f2 discussion I think we should be allowed to decide what f2 actually selects
I think that s what hotkeys are for
I bind F1 4 to be screen position recall and F5 8 to be screen position save It works out really nicely would recommend
Give siege tank in siege mode priority to attack massive vs massive attack bonus after upgrade unlocked by fusion core
They should finally get rid of those flying tanks
While Blizzard is talking about Disruptor shots being unbound from F2 could they do the same for Locusts
I need to say that all points mentioned in update are very much in line with what our community was saying for some time already Cool to see that Blizz is listening I was hoping for more details about Z nerf and or P buff as that seems to be something that needs more focus Anyway very good Comm Feed
I mean its understandable to not bring up balance issues immediately before the first major tourney
It s also a feedback update not a balance patch yet
Glad they are pointing out who the target audience of Co op missions are I think a good way to make them harder while still encouraging casual players to play them is by increasing difficulty gaps between Normal Hard and Brutal with a game speed increase above Normal This way it s still easier on Normal but Brutal will be closer to the campaign level of difficulty Also make sure to do the balance test map for the burrow changes the number of users who try it shows the level of interest in the change
Just make a difficulty level above Brutal No reason to mess with what s there already
The more difficulties you add the worse it will get better to change what you have than add more and more and more tiers
That doesn t make sense Adding a new difficulty does not make it worse it just adds another level of difficulty for people who are finding brutal too easy
Many of my friends find Normal too easy and Hard too hard increasing the difficulty between Normal and Hard would just exacerbate the problem
The worse what will get Plenty of games do this without issue Add a Legendary mode or something
I am excited for the future of coop I would loved to see like themed mission DLC like Broowar Missions or like character themed Was talking to a friend about this and we both agreed Like we love just sitting back and relaxing and chatting as we do coop and it s good fun Also would love a balance post Parasitic Bomb is gross lurkers are gross and zerg seems super strong Parasitic Bomb is so strong that it basically doesn t make you split it makes you avoid it or you lose your air army Very frustrating
What do you mean it doesn t make you split You should always be worried about clumping your air army together ZvT It s just one more thing to worry about
I mean as a Protoss sorry Like splitting Pheonix doesn t help they just die anyways it seems So much single target DPS too
Think of PB as storm that stack and follow a marine until it dies I d run the hell away from that kind of storm than split At least Raven HSM is delayed and had a range limit PB damage is instant
F2 no longer selecting disruptor shots is a big plus in my book
Would the individual bunker upgrade remove the ability for command centers to store additional workers When you get neosteel frame the amount of SCVs that a CC can load increases as well I actually use this sometimes if I m expanding to an island so that I can load up 10 15 SCVs into the CC right away Also how would salvage work with this
Blizzard you are simply amazing
About tanks I and many others would really like it if we removed smart fire upped the damage to flat 50 or 60 and made the medivac changes that you are talking about
Just wanna take the time to say thank you so very much for the transparency and regular communication Blizzard It keeps me much more interested in the game and hopeful for the future of StarCraft Hope to see a nice increase in popularity both for casual play and in the e sports region StarCraft is still my favorite game to watch tournaments of
Can someone please explain to me why they made the disruptor shoot its indestructible load I thought the only thing that made it bearable was that you got to trash the expensive asshole after its mischief but now What s an appropriate non raging reaction
I m still campaigning for this Bunker Orbital addition
You should be able to join arcade game chatrooms from the lobby window Seems like a massive oversight You have to search the game to join its chatroom which means most people never will since most people play the game from the new game list
Terran player here but doesn t it seem weird that they re making disruptors even more forgiving by taking the ball out of the f2 It s a thing you can control and it s not like it gets added to your control group
yeah i find zerg too strong as a terran player Late game ultra viper is too strong and lurkers are good too
for the love of god david please do something about zerg
How is the stalker blink on dusk towers a bug I thought that was intentional considering it makes so much sense Really sad they re removing it
if tank pickup is changed to have them un siege then there s basically no reason to pick them up unless you want to save them from being killed That change would destroy more or less any offensive drop play
I believe the tank pick up was designed to save them not offensive play So this should not bother them
On the other hand sieged tanks are almost essential to defend ravager roach early pushes If tanks are no longer sieged after dropped by medivac it may become more difficult for T to defend Still I think that could be fixed by doing something to ravagers which would benefit all match ups
It will definitely become more difficult to defend Lifting tanks in siege was the only way to easily dodge corrosive bile shots I don t think they should get rid of tank lift but they should definitely make a viable way for terran to dodge bile shots with tanks
bear in mind that if the tank is unsieged upon pick up well there you go The ravager has basically accomplished its mission because now you have to drop the tank again siege it back up and meanwhile you re still under fire I would like them to leave the tank drop thing alone It s been already nerfed tanks can t fire for 2 seconds upon being dropped
If they remove the 2 sec delay when unsieged tank is dropped it might work better Think of immortal micro against roach all in But the unsieged tank is always bad vs anything Probably a damage buff to compensate would be better
you can still harrass with the proposed siege tank Tank drops will happen still but you don t sacrifice the tank in the way you used to in hots
Yep it just makes it a bit safer I actually like tank drops but this isn t a bad solution since you can still harass with tanks and other units but now you can save the tanks while still maintaining positioning micro
well hang on we never sacrificed tanks or even want to If you lose all your tanks in a push guess what The push is effectively over Those tanks had better get decent value for their cost supply or what good are they
The 2 medivac bio with 2 some tanks drop that saw some play in hots was sacrificing at least 1 tank to get some damage done This is a form of harrass one that Blizz wanted to strengthen All the proposition changes is that you can get a tank out and harrass more effectively because the tank lives longer and can be re dropped
You re gonna have to show me some replays because HotS was not about the tank It was about the widow mine and the 4M push
I never said it happened often but it happened occasionally as something different to do on ladder Blizz strengthened it as an option and even with this change it s still viable That s all I said
I agree It s more about hot pickup from the start And this change may bring back more positional plays while allowing more micro opportunities to save them in unfavorable positions
Not even a mention of the balance issues is a bad move imo Seriously they need to nut up and just say they are holding off on balance changes for the moment if that is their position It feels way worse to have no recognition that balance is likely out of whack and they just need more data to make their changes
Hope Blizzard remake Sc BW soon cuz there are no balance in Sc2 Everything goes wrong in LotV beta
Still no word about ravagers they need their armored tag back Invulnerable nydus needs a fix tooThat is seriously impressive
Thanks bud I worked hard on it feels good to have it look complete if only for a short while
Link us your battlenet profile so we can check if you used win botting for the multiplayer modes
http us battle net sc2 en profile 1182801 1 Kai Not trying to cover anything up I win traded the 1v1 achievements manually without a bot no one gets hurt by this The teams wins I did manually by playing team games as you can see in my profile it took years
Hey OP is there an easy way to do the custom game achievements these ones http us battle net sc2 en profile 1182801 1 Kai achievements category 4325392 IIRC picking random race will give you credit for the random the race you end up getting towards the achievement right
Yes and select the highest difficulty and you will get the lower ones as you get the higher ones Just rush a ton D Ps they might have changed I did them 5 years ago
I did those back in WOL and yeah the only trick is to go random until you max out the random achievements and do some hyper aggressive rush every game Even with bad micro the AI can t handle pulling workers in a cannon rush 6 pool or whatever I did for T double proxy rax I think Most of those games were on Steppes of War lol
Do people still do that Or did they put in some kind of countermeasure
Im not sure if they did they might have made it so the win doesn t count towards achievements if you leave the game very early
http eu battle net sc2 en profile 522965 1 iLiZiUM not OP btw
That must have been a pain in the ass to complete
More than you could imagine
Did the Lost Viking from WoL campaign arcade machine bring you any troubles Sir
Well in my achievements tab it shows me get the 250k on December 5th 2010 and the 500k on December 9th 2010 so I guess it took me a few tries but I don t remember struggling too much
I see you are pretty active posting in this thread so thank you for providing your feedback here Are you Achievement Hunter in any other games If so then which game type do you prefer FPS RTS RPG
Not really actually I played a lot of skyrim but I don t play many other PC games I was a very heavy Diablo II player and I do play LoL now but I am getting bored of it
Hell it s about time
I love you Jim Never forget it
You should submit your time and claim you have world first for the Starcraft 2 100 speedrun
I m not even first done someone on my friends list beat me by a few days Us achievement trolls stick together
can i join the party Are you on EU
NA FOR THE SWARM
Fine ill hold up the EU fort so D
And here I am with my WoL campaign still unfinished rofl
http puu sh lEKS4 fdf55ee05c jpg
have an upvote
But I m the guy who s done nothing but play competitive ladder instead haha So not entirely applicable I haven t finished a single player game longer than 6 hours since Halo 3 or something rofl
He has all the multiplayer achievements as well this includes the 1000 wins for each race 1s and teams
Which is why I said not entirely applicable He had to go ham on multiplayer in a way I never will I wouldn t call either of us casual to be honest but I certainly feel that way when I look at the dedication he displayed in getting achievements in modes that bore me to tears and send me running back to 1v1 ladder
each race AAAAND random
You may die in peace now brother
I heard new co op heroes are coming I m only free for now
Enjoy it while it lasts then And wish the rest of us luck on doing that stupid FUCKING LOST VIKINGS ACHIEVEMENT
I ve heard about that whats the deal I did it like 5 years ago
The one in the WoL Campaign where you need to play that stupid game on the arcade machine I don t have the patience or the skill to beat the terratron score 500k points
I know I did it no problem I thought it got harder or something
No I m just shit
yea I me too Did they change the game or something
Just one question How long did it take
Years Not exactly sure how long definitely hundreds of hours
took me 3 5 years to get all the achievements ffa drained my soul up to hots and i guess 3 weeks for all the lotv ones
Didn t they remove the FFA achievements
i dont know i earned them before that It looks like for players who havent got it its gone but if you have earned it its still there
Hence his drained soul
Yes FFA and FFA achievements were removed
Damn I did like 90 of LoTV achievements and asked myself what am I doing with my life I looked at the full achievement list for all expansions including AI games etc noped the fuck out That s some serious dedication
Im a grinder man completionist for life You can do it you just have to believe
Any advice
On what Don t do what I did if thats what you re asking
if your passion lasts long enough you ll get there one day aswell
I did all the WoL and HotS achievments I m planning to do the LotV campaign too I would really love to have all the other achievments too But playing 1k games against the A I feels just to dumb to me
it s only 250
For each faction including random although random wins give faction wins too
250 Zerg 250 Terran 250 Protoss 250 Random Teamgames with A I
Oh and it is trust me
The Race vs AI achievements must of taken you a bloody long time
I don t want to talk about it
I did a bunch of VS AI matches in the multiplayer tab because it was wrong not having the slider all the way Can t you just cheese them and win in 3 minutes I was 13gas 12pooling and won every time I guess after a while that gets stale but you don t have to do them all at once
you can but imagine doing that 250 times with each race The worst achieement for me is a toss up between Vs AI or FFA
Can you still play FFA matchmaking in older expansion versions I see it was removed from the current UI but the gamemode still exists right
Dang Artosis could learn about Passion from you Congrats Which achievement did you find the most satisfying And which of the campaign achievements did you find the most challenging
Predator was the most satisfying took fucking forever The most challenging I think was the final mission of WoL on brutal I m bad with Terran and that mission is fucking nuts
What s your achievement score
http puu sh lEJLM 1da1a18027 jpg
Disappointingly not a round number gratz by the way
It s over 9000
The multiplayer ones are immense That s amazing there can t be many people who have done what you have Did you get the ones that you can t do anymore like the Mothership Vortex one
Of course http puu sh lEJK0 a6f4c7e42c jpg
Did you get the 800 FFA though
Of course http puu sh lEKmy 666478ec71 jpg
Damn son Too legit
Can t you get them setting expansion level to WoL
I never thought of that to be honest
You have my respect
Thanks
Whoa Well done
The real question is which achievements do you have listed on your showcase
I should redo them really but in what I posted its Team Protoss FFA 800 Competitve Zen Master Solo Zerg 1000 Solo Zen Master
Congrats
You re fucking insane lol
No you
You still need the top 50 GM achievement
I only get ones that give points
Great job now you can work on getting all the portraits P
Some are pay 2 get which is why I do not bother with them
I ve always sorta wanted to do this but there s some in there that just turn me off the whole thing Like winning 500 bot games and stuff That s not an achievement that s a waste of time Wish they wouldn t do stuff like that
Embrace the grind my friend
Now you just need to beat all user made custom stuff lol
No chance I was never into UMS
And what is your rank in the real world aka ladder Because this is where the computer game ends and the real competition begins Nontheless congrats for your achievements in one of the best and most tough computer games edit ye I am a bit of an oldschool
http puu sh lELdT a7f65299d3 jpg That was season 1 I haven t played much competitively since then but I am thinking of playing more in LotV for sure got sick of LoL
prepare your ass Masters in 2010 is high plat now no joke so you didn t achieved much really until now If you get masters nowadays that would be something without hackers boosters and shit But most of all gl hf
http eu battle net sc2 en profile 522965 1 iLiZiUMPlease for the love of god Blizzard give us a choice Let the people who want to micro roaches in the normal way be able to micro roaches in the normal way let those who want to do it differently do it differently There we go problem solved
This won t change anything for existing micro it would seem Only making a new hotkey if you have both burrowed and unburrowed in the same hotkey and still the one key if they are all burrowed
2 obvious problems Ctrl clicking a burrowed roach selects only burrowed roaches currently This change will stop someone from using that to micro burrowed roaches BRs or Above Ground Roaches AGRs seperately I do this every single game when I get Burrow this might be fine if they decide that roaches can be like hellbats and hellions Every standard user will have to change their unburrow or burrow hotkey because having them on the same key will stop you from unburrowing BRs when AGRs are in the same selection Like having siege and unsiege does for tanks and hellbats and hellions too so I can t see a precidented way out of this Most users will have to at least relearn hotkeys I ll have to relearn hotkeys and be completely unable to select all BRs at the same time without boxing them I ll check that the mod does indeed stop you from doing these things when I have time in about an hour but from the sounds of it it will
We don t know that it will change the Ctrl clicking yet
I checked it doesn t But having to learn a new hotkey after 5 years is gonna be rough especially as it s a pointless thing to change
It s something that SHOULD have been changed years ago but it wasn t because for the most part people didn t use burrow so there weren t much complaints
Why should it Roach burrow is totally different to Mine Burrow or Tank siege or any of the other units you re trying to make it the same as I don t give a fuck about the other Zerg units Roaches are more interesting when they burrow Why are you hamstringing the people who have learned how to do these things and have been doing them for 5 years I want to give people a choice in the matter It doesn t give one side an advantage over the other so why force the change why not give us a fucking choice
This isn t even going to change anything for you If you still want to select between burrowed and unburrowed it s going to be the one hot key It will not change ANY of your existing micro
I completely agree with you that we should be given the option to have one or the other within the game menu There s no god damn reason we shouldn t and it would be just immensely lazy on blizzards part if they can t find it in their time to make it so However if it doesn t work out and blizz drops the ball it won t be that bad in a practicality sense The functionality for lurkers is the exact same as the tank The only difference is that the lurker becomes cloaked upon burrowing and so the lurker itself the change is fine The roach micro will only become more complex in my opinion Burrowed roaches aren t really used the way they were in the past Forcefields are slowly fading into obscurity in PvZ and so burrowed roach timings to counter it are becoming lost and forgotten Using burrowed roaches to hit outlying bases don t really require an immense amount of babysitting unlike those circumventing FF so I can t imagine it will hurt too bad Even though I really enjoy playing with burrowed roaches and infestors players will have to lasso a handful of them to burrow instead of tabbing which in all honesty raises the skill floor and ceiling
I really like your second point Terran has this functionality with all of their mech units tanks banshees even widow mines who have arguably the same burrow mechanic as roaches As a Z T main I think it would make sense for burrowed units to follow the same rules
You misunderstand I think I want to keep roaches how they are because I don t want to relearn my hotkeys I don t want to have to learn to not press tab anymore I want to be able to play the way I always have
Try being a base cam injector Having to relearn hotkeys is not really that bad While I find your CTL click argument intriguing and not anything I had thought of if that proves false then this is a common sense change
sorry Why does being a base cam injector mean that you ve relearned hotkeys Wandering queens can be fixed entirely by not spamming too much and lessened a lot by using this method https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3mtsu0 a possible solution to wandering queens that
I believe the two comments show why that doesn t really work I have switched to the core and then the core2 0 and then the core 2 tnek I know plenty about having to relearn hotkeys It only takes a little practice to relearn a hotkey Relearning how I perform an action sequence on the scale of injecting was insanely difficult The point is though hotkeys have been changed a ton over the three games Making one more simple change when it makes so much sense is worth the minimum annoyance remapping a single hotkey will be Full disclosure I m completely biased I already have burrow and unburrow on different hotkeys and this will only help me So feel free to down vote me into oblivion
OR you could just be careful and not overspam it s pretty simple That s why I want a choice don t force people to relearn hotkeys I ve been using roughly the same hotkey setup for 17 years now why would I ever want to change it 17 years of muscle memory is hard to break The whole seperate hotkeys for siege and unsiege is one of the main reasons I ve never seriously played Terran in sc2 because it s totally different to what I ve been doing for most of my life
now you can t have the same hotkey for burrow and unburrow
I d like to piggyback and say just give us the choice for ALL units with two modes I ve never liked having two hotkeys for any of those abilities siege unsiege cloak decloak burrow unburrow for WMs etc I understand that enable toggle conflicts exists but this setting falls apart if ctrl click does not differentiate between the two modes of these units
This Can we upvote this enough so that people shut up about this topic
oh btw the first 5 comments on the bnet page are hilarious
Can someone paste the information Website is blocked at my job
We ve just published a new Balance test map titled OrbitalShipyard 3 0 5 Balance v1 0 We ve created this test map in order to explore burrowed and unburrowed units being in the same sub group and having two separate hotkeys for Burrow and Unburrow We ve also included bug fixes to the Disruptor and to the Dusk Towers map We encourage you to test out these changes to do so just go to Multiplayer and navigate to Custom The new test map will be at the top of the list We look forward to hearing your feedback and seeing how these changes affect the game and please remember that none of these changes are final Balance Testing Extension Mod We ve also updated the Extension Mod for balance testing so that you can play around with these changes on a variety of maps Those of you who are interested in trying out the Extension Mod can do the following to get started 1 Navigate to Browse Maps on the Custom Games menu 2 Select a map and click the Create with Mod button in the lower right corner 3 Choose to sort by Blizzard Mods from the dropdown list at the top of the screen 4 Select the Balance Test Mod Extension from the list and then hit Create Game If you re interested in the StarCraft II Balance Team s reasoning behind these potential changes you can check out Senior Designer David Kim s Community Feedback Update We d like to remind you that feedback based on playtesting is the most helpful information you can share with us at this time We kindly ask that you spend some time playing games on the test map before offering your thoughts on the changes listed above As always thank you for your continued feedback and support Once you feel you ve had enough time to test thoroughly we welcome you to share your feedback
hrm anyone know what said bugs on the disrupter are
F2 selecting the disruptor shots probably that s what they mentioned in the feedback update
oh yeah forgot that was a thing
lol how bad do you have to be to use f2 so frequently that you re selecting DISRUPTOR SHOTS with it
I didn t even know it happened Very few protosses use F2 because it fucks up observer placement The only race that can reliably use F2 is Terran
MorroW s first remark when he properly thought about playing protoss I can t use all army anymore because it fucks with observers
0 10
Wow the truth doesn t bother you does it
the scale doesnt get negative you can stop trying now
go back to sccj
I don t use F2 at all Messes up positioning of all the units not currently in my main army
I made it to master all the while abusing f2 I ain t that good but I m not terrible either
protoss player confirmed
deleted
Not really with observers the mothership core and observers on the field
obvious uninformed comment is obvious
For fuck s sake Blizzard Just buff Siege Tanks already It s not fair for them to get absolutely fucked up even with an upgrade advantage in a straight up TvP engagement against STALKERS of all things I don t care if you have to get rid of the tank drop mechanic just buff them already
Found the Avilo sub
Yeah as a Zerg that sounds awful All that would do if encourage turtle Terran Maybe you are a proponent of turtle Terran but if so you should just switch to simcity
Or Blizzard should make more playstyles than just MMM Liberators viable
I know this has been said before but wtf blizz That was the most shittest ending for staftcraft 2 campagin i mean seriously raynor never seen again okay boy i can fucking think of a better ending then that end urselfsAgreed When someone tells me to kill myself I don t like having to look at it highlighted in pink for the next two hours
or stop playing zerg Kappa
I was thinking this had to be a Protoss player
Or someone using liberators
I think he may be a Starcraft player
Isn t there a clear command
There is but it only clears it until you ve played a game You clear it play a game and the chat is full again
Even if you just filter a particular chat channel or conversation using the dropdown menu in the top left of the chat window or the keyboard shortcuts and switch back the cleared text reappears
lol yes totally its so damn stupid
also copy pasting links
this is probably one of the most important things for me I really really really HATE trying to send something and the link does not work
You can t highlight anything let alone links lmfao this chat is a complete downgrade
I just want to send funny memes plz blizzard
Really it s just copying Pasting works fine
Can we just have the old chat back it was better in nearly every way
The new chat is just so confusing I recently ran a tournament and a lot of players were replying in wrong chats and not getting their messages seen
No not really The new chat system is better it needs numerous corrections though We need to stop having to tab through everything Something that makes also Heroes chat frustrating We need clean tabs of every channel query open just like dota 2 for example plus more mouse activity commands over the chat
definitely agree with you here the new one is so damn stupid i simply cannot believe how it made the design
Heroes is full of stupid there comes the design from
Just add the posibility to make other seperate chat windows Like in the old chatsystem but keep the general edit WE WANT the quirkiness of the General Chat but also have the option to go into private spaces JUST LIKE BROODWAR You still don t get it do you Blizzard Do you really want Chat Rooms Frank Pearce 2010 I think that is most ridiculous question ever made from someone who should know about the interwebs Seriously to use the words of one of the most aknowledged person in esport WHAT AN IDIOT No Frank we want facebook integration s holy shit IDIOTS yes I am mad because I literally can t undestand that level of stupidity
The technology just isn t there yet
anymore
The old chat system was much better and like it or not more streamlined Being able to close things with a simple GUI interface is superior to the 1996 IRC clone we have now in almost every way Blizz can easily make Tournament chat un leavable while still in the tournament just as Party chat was un leavable while in party The 3 0 system is especially detrimental to people typing who are in game and being forced to tab through 20 different players to chat with because they can t x out of chats while in menus It also means tons of players miss important messages I cannot begin to count how many people have said I didn t see your message after 3 0 came out This definitely isn t an improvement on the chat experience Furthermore Patch 3 0 was supposedly designed to make the sc2 experience more social which is a great thing to have Automated tournaments more chat channels et cetera all help make this possible but the new interface is simply not conducive to the social experience Fix this fast u Psione and you ll have an even better product
This is all so true and obvious When i saw the new chat in beta i thought it was a beta Now seeing this is the final product is hilarious
That s what happens when you tell people not to complain Because it is in Beta
it s embarrassingly bad
Honestly what was wrong with the old chat system it was more effective
The new chat is very unaccessible Old system was much more convenient Why do we have to type in commands like in the 1990s I dont get it Also we need the chat windows back
I prefer slash commands much faster to use w than right clicking someone in your friend s list However there are definitely some kinks to work out
no reason both commands and small click boxes like before cant be implemented
not using commands in the 2010 s You must use Ubuntu
The problem with making it easy is that in the end it will become a barren chat just like what we had before
While everybody s shitting on the new chat system I d like to take a moment to appreciate some of the improvements that came with it being able to see everything in one chat window I think it s a lot more convenient as long as there isn t so much activity that you can t keep up being able to see previous lobby chat after games being able to right click on player names in lobby chat even after they or you have left having a lobby chat for arcade maps without actual lobbies now like Aiur Chef slash commands they re not for everybody but no one is forced to use them or at least shouldn t be keyboard navigation message timestamps being able to check out a player s profile when they invite you to a lobby fewer distracting toast notifications being able to see the few most recent messages even when the chat window is closed joined chats are actually persistent across restarts now before it was very buggy being able to see who s in a party and who isn t when mousing over players in chat participants lists I feel like the new chat system gives me a better overview of everything that s happening and only really falters when there s a lot of activity and especially when you re trying to focus on a particular conversation and when you re trying to engage in multiple conversations at the same time That said there are problems with the new chat system including the inability to leave whisper conversations and empty chat channels using only the mouse changing the active chat channel never know how many times I have to tab or which number corresponds to which chat channel for slash commands focusing on particular conversations the keyboard shortcut doesn t work for me and I think it shouldn t display notices from other channels like lobbies the contrast between message headers timestamp channel name clan tag player name and the message text It s too low and makes it difficult to visually parse the chat log especially when the channel name is long players have clan tags and long names so that every message no matter how short gets broken into at least two lines the chat showing RealID BattleTag names but the lobby list showing character names or was it the other way around not being able to catch up on conversations in game anymore not being able to see private in game chat anymore many slash commands not working in game such as pinvite the issue described here several minor issues such as having to type the clan tag when joining sending to clan chat channels or players in clans When you start typing a channel or player name it should offer auto complete suggestions for channel player names matching that string regardless of whether or not they re in a clan unpinned chat windows not disappearing when they re scrolled to any position except the bottom AM PM instead of 24 hour timestamps the six channel limit the way cycling through your previously sent messages works I d like it to work more like it does in my IRC client not being able to copy text from the chat log
There were slash commands in the old chat btw They just weren t advertised a lot
Oh yeah there were a few like w and r IIRC They were only in game though right
Another vote here for just bringing back the old chat system so easy to use and no pointless spam such as achievements and who goes offline and comes online its so stupid to have all the messages in one box it makes me want to leave and why should we have to type a stupid command to leave a chat or do anything i just dont understand the point of adding that and any group clan general chat we are kicked out while in a game so we miss every message making it feel a very dead place i know there is a way to get around that by ticking a box and setting status to busy but holy shit i thought they were supposed to make the chat better not this complete shit of a downgrade sad times for me
at least sc2 has the option heroes of the storm doesn t even have leave which can be pretty annoying
deleted
its not even good like bw was its just terrible
Constructive criticism like this is exactly what we need you re a pillar of the community Thanks
i detailed some stuff in my other comments in this thread dawg keep up being a pillar of the community by continuing to make more posts like these literally a pillar of the community
I remember reading r SC when they introduced this chat system and I saw on stream how it works and seeing positive feedback about new chat system was really confusing I could tell It was absolute fucking garbage the moment I saw it only typing commands to control chat like it s fucking telnet client from 90 s You have to always type leave to leave a chat that some faggot opened to BM you after lost game and so on Previous chat system was so much better was so much more intuitive and I could do there anything I want I understand that when you have 30 chat windows it can be confusing but same thing with this system I would be very glad if Blizzard would bring back old system and forget about current garbage
Copy paste leave with a space at the end
blizz cant make a fucking chat ever
Yes And clearing chat should do so permanently It shouldnt reappear after the next game Also would be nice to have the option of having a conversation in another chat window rather than have two thousand different conversations all in pink
i ve lost count the amount of times i have talked to the wrong person its so damn annoying and stupid
There s an option to leave if you right click either the name of the chat in the chat box or from the dropdown at the top left That said the whole chat system is terrible and should be reverted
what i need is the old chat back this whole new chat is so bad i don t even want to flame people anymore after games but to be honest it s really bad and makes me not want to chat at all
yeah me too man and i used to keep a space at the bottom of my screen visible while alt tabbed in borderless windowd mode so i could see a new chat pop up see who is talking to me now its dead and so much more effort
I don t really know what s wrong with leave If I think about it mechanically with your hands Your left hand does all the work with the E A and V Only your right hand needs the L and With that being said I think having a right click or something like that would be extremely useful
But thinking about it mechanically it would only require one or two clicks of the mouse on your right hand to exit a chat if Blizzard added the functionality
agreed not arguing your ultimate point Just not sure about taking out leave Good word Blizzard SHOULD add another option
I don t know about you but when I m sitting in the menus both my hands are not resting on the keyboard It was much more convenient to be able to click everything in chat
WELL GEMINI THAT S BECAUSE YOU ARE A SCRUB AND YOUR GF KEEPS MAKING FUN OF YOUR LADDER RANK DROPPING 3
We need a facebook twitter skype twitch integration button
Yup The new chat design is retarded Look at how good B Net 1 0 was then copy thatThats pretty awesome dude
thank you D
That is amazing coming from both a starcraft fan and a mine craft fan
thank you good sir
Anything to avoid playing SC Ladder anxiety is real and summed up in one picture
He s playing Zerg What s he afraid of 4Head
I play protoss and completely suck Then i swapped to zerg and sucked too I really suck at starcraft but damn i love it
Oh god I can relate so much I played toss and sucked Then moved to terran I still stuck but damn why is this game so much fun
Play Terran and just build mass marine and medi vac Ez wins
You clearly dont play Terran
Because marinerushes are not a thing and don t work in bronze
Who the fuck is talking about wood league here Only you
Yes because the guy with ladder anxiety who just is so bad at this game and the other guy telling him to just build marines and medivacs are clearly talking about top masters
Because ladder anxiety only affects bronze players Right
Jeez If that guy is not a bronze leaguer he will know that is not viable for him anymore I don t see your point
Even a Gold like me can sadly attest this
One day I thought to myself Hell I ll make something SC related So I ve put down 5 columns of grey wool like 5 bricks tall made a circle in the middle with wool too and thought to myself Now that looks like a hatchery I feel bad now that I thought about something so bad A Hive after looking at your picture Great job man That really is amazing
thank ya
That is legit I say it deserves a Hivefive
Hivefive
HiveFives all around
o o
Good god you re gay
Now I feel bad about my crappy Minecraft creations Nah really though great job
I know right Guys Look I built a dirt hut guys
The secret to success is to make wool
3 words flint and steel
Red Mage will protect me
danke
You re playing the wrong game P Still pretty awesome
p thank you
this is cool and I like what looks like a vespene geyser there on the bottom left If I had one critique you require more minerals
You are a drone Now get me my spawning pool

holy shit world download
you can find it here http www planetminecraft com project zerg hive
so how did you build it did you map out the design in your head and build it one block by one block or did you use a third party editing software
I had it in my head how I was going to do it but used server side plugins such as World Edit and Voxel Sniper to build it but made some things by hand
This is amazing man
thankss
Holy fcking shit My balls just exploded
oh no
Should ve made it in StarMade so you could ve crashed a carrier into it P
Just the right amount of scary very cool
I really suck at starcraft but damn why is this game so much fun

I really suck at starcraft but damn why is this game so much fun
That is pretty cool
ty m8
Pretty sick looking
Passion right there
D
whatever it takes to get that reddit karma amirite
im an addict
The fuck happened to minecraft
it was thrown in a 3d renderer software
ahh
Took me a second look to realize that the green stuff is supposed to be the vespene geysir great suff D
idk what it is tbh a thing with a mouth green blobs and baneling eggs
I thought it was eggs from Spawn Larvae
Amazing Oh man well done indeed
Next stop create a computer that has sc2 in it in minecraft Seriously what effort must have gone to this just incredible and good background choice as well
dindt take too long either just 2 days D
I guess the next assignment would take a bit more than that D
im thinking of doing one of those massive zerg creatures that fart around in space
Now if someone skins the creepers as banelings you ll be set
There is already a mod for that I saw it a while ago
The fuck happened to minecraft it was eggs from Spawn Larvae
Damn does that mean that a drone is 50x bigger than me with those proportions
Damn that thing is big more like an Overmind
Uuhmm I think you accidentally made the Overmind
this isnt nearly as epic
You re gonna put spawners in there right

The good kindaaaaaaaand another one of these useless voting competitions
Yeah it s basically Which one of these strategy games has the biggest community competition
LotV wins best starcraft game of the year
FTFY
which strategy game released this year
I thought the same thing and was going to just keep my mouth shut but then here you come in and just totally voice my innermost thoughts
Then why do nintendo games still win o O
there were other rts games this year
Act of Aggression came out in September It s pretty good It s not Starcraft but it s a good traditional RTS
It s strategy game competition not only RTS Total War Attila for example is both turn based strategy and real time tactics
Rome 2 sucked and Attila was much better That said Shogun 2 was much better than both of those
Rome 2 on release was shit source pre ordered it Shogun 2 was the best TW game so far and Atilla s shit compared to Rome 2 after 17 patches
Grey Goo Act of Aggression Etherium Age of Empires II The African Kingdoms Planetary Annihilation Titans Homeworld Remastered Collection Nightside Blitzkrieg 3 and Hegemony III Clash of the Ancients All these games and expansions released this year not too bad
oh wow i didnt even know about aoe2 african kingdoms im gonna get that now thanks
It s fucking awesome The new civs are kind of OP though I guess that s one way to get more sales
It really is good I love how they created a new African architecture style for the civs and voice acting for the expansion Also the inclusion of new generic units for all civs is cool too Best of all it was pretty well priced for the content provided
Only two of those games received good reviews though Homeworld Remastered Collection HD update of games from 1999 and 2003 and AoE II The African Kingdoms new expansion for a game released in 1999
Grey Goo received some pretty good reviews The only downright BAD review it received based on metacritic is from Quarter to Three which is basically Tom Chick s personal strategy game blog I m not sure why that s on there but whatever Act of Aggression did receive middling reviews along with Etherium I will at least recommend Grey Goo to anyone looking for a good rts besides LotV that came out this year Not because of multiplayer because it s not got a very big community but the single player campaign has a pretty good story with cut scenes that dare I say rival what Blizzard does Its also been on sale a lot lately so there is another plus Also the soundtrack was done by Frank Klepacki who did the soundtrack for a lot of the Command and Conquer games and it s exellent
It s a shame I actually found Grey Goo s multiplayer a lot funner than SC2 because it was a little less demanding in terms of remembering to macro
Most people found Grey Goo s multiplayer so really shallow compared to every other game out there low micro cap on every unit very easy macro beta and humans played really similarly etc Dumbing down the game makes it a lot more accessible but it also makes it less appealing because of the lack of depth and it loses the pull It has to be complex in one avenue and grey goo was in none Micro cap Low Resource gathering 1 type and shallow Unit construction Really easy with the global hotkeys and auto build Techpaths Those were fairly interesting Compositions Not really there Maps Chokepoint oriented maps Add no replay support and observer mode there and you get why it is dead
Yeah I really like how they kind of mimicked the style of MOBA hotkeys with the in GG cause I also have issues remembering hotkeys but it s a lot more simple this way
oh shit blitzkrieg 3
So many RTS titles and nobody s thought to mention them or even suggest them as alternatives to SC2 What s going on
What he said still stands the strategy competition is thin These games might as well not exist
Grey Goo
Next year Day 9 s RTS will give SC2 a run for its money
Is Artillery releasing it next year
That s the plan according to their site of course delays may lead to that release date being amended
Hopefully it will just lure more people to RTS i think we are at such a point that any new RTS is not even a competition anymore
Have you read the latest design blog about the squad and hero unit design I really can see the potential of forming a full three man team with a mock up race of different unit mechanics but I worry a bit about the game heading too far towards a battle arena style game If it can ride that line between the two I m all aboard
I for one would totally play a RTS MOBA hybrid
Total war arena is exactly this
Not quite what I envisioned The kind of MOBA RTS hybrid I want to see would be like this A typical DotA style map designed for 5v5 play Multiple factions including Raynor s Raiders Terran Bio The Dominion Terran Mech The Swarm Protoss Void Protoss the Hybrid Humans WarCraft Orcs Undead Night Elves Pandaren Vrykul Naga Blood Elves Heaven Hell Forces of Tristram Forces of Caldeum and Overwatch A draft pick mode with picks and bans You earn Mineral and Gas income over time and your income increases based on how many enemy towers you snipe No heroes Each faction has about 8 to 10 units to pick from to avoid overcomplicating things You can earn additional Mineral and Gas income by killing neutral hostile creeps in the jungle
There is one like that called AirMech There is also another currently in beta called Servo that looks like it s shaping up to be along the lines of a MOBA RTS some people call them Action RTS If you re looking for something like an arena based rts game take a look at Total War Arena it might be the closest thing to that
Like Supernova
Not traditional RTS won t take away from SC2 more of the Airmech style
Like there was any competition
Not terribly surprising Game developers have been edging away from strategically tough games for years now Blizzard Starcraft have long gone against this trend
RIP Grey Goo
Holy shit it didn t even get a mention poor Petroglyph
Yeah wtf
I had really high hopes for Grey Goo but they kinda botched it It could have been a good game if they had given it some more time or at least made it feature complete before release They didn t even include replay functionality at launch
That game lost any relevancy to me because it was so expensive I mean I m totally alright paying for something like Starcraft because it s Starcraft and I trust Blizzard to deliver but paying 45 for a completely new IP No thanks
It was on sale for 20 bucks not too long ago and it is less than a year old
Best PC exclusive too
baldurs gate or pillars or eternity should take best PC every year
PoE s story was great but the actual game part was really clunky and unfun and it has the worst AI pathing I ve seen in a long time
You can t give it to remastered versions of old games
Don t you dare to go against the circlejerk
o right o my god fucking 140 aoe damage units like disrupters and 60 mineral patches and gold bases and liberators WHAT AN AMAZING GAME
140 aoe damage on a big cooldown It s pretty damn reasonable compared to the reaver s 125 or the spider mine s 120
Pretty sure the same reaver is 80 damage from some campaign I have think wol Also it s aoe is much slower and the unit can t bail out and retreat on a whim Also the weapon does just fly through the units into the middle It s really not the same or similar
It also won Best PC Exclusive 2015
Other RTS games came out this year
Not RTS strategy in general and yes a few good ones
Age of Empires II HD got an expansion released a few weeks back that the community seems to be enjoying Act of Aggression Grey Goo and the Planetary Annihilation expansion were also released And a few remakes like Homeworld Remastered
Yeah I got AoA and Homeword Remastered AoA was pretty underwhelming though
STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP IT
Wow those were some super cool picks Glad to see StarCraft The Witcher III Pillars of Eternity and Sword Coast Legends scoring so high or even being mentioned honestly As for strategy games Satellite Reign is a cool cyberpunk game brought back all those Syndicate memories Both this and Act of Aggression are currently on Steam sale
http www game debate com awards 2015 best pc exclusive PC Exclusive award too apparently
Some stiff competition there
LotV garnered an astounding 62 of the votes singlehandedly edging out Total War Attila and two other games I ve never heard of before LotV also took home the prize of Best PC Exclusive of 2015 edging out Pillars of Eternity Shadowrun Hong Kong and Satellite Reign
that s hardly surprising
I can t tell if this was a shit year for gaming or this list is just shit SC2 deserves these awards but a lot of these other games don t deserve awards
Sick competition D
As if there was any competition
Also won best PC Exclusive
very hard to win that
Duh of course LotV wins best strategy game out there since Starcraft II pretty much killed the RTS genre a few years ago
Can we say it killed the genre I mean can we blame Blizzard for making good RTS games for the failure of the other developers Ensemble Studios in particular dug their own grave and kicked themselves into it by trying to make a FTP RTS game
Ensemble Studios was unfortunately broken up by Microsoft before development on AoEO began Both Gas Powered Games of Supreme Commander fame and Robot Entertainment were the ones to work on the game though RE did have a decent number of former Ensemble employees in it If anyone is to blame for that abortion it s Microsoft for trying to turn Age of Empires into a microtransaction cash cow
Aaaah that s interesting I think the big success of extremely late AoE II expansion packs really shows what type of content people want from an AoE game Not having to pay money for every civ is a big one
I completely agree and I m glad who ever is in charge of pushing for these expansions at Microsoft are doing what they are We re also seeing an expansion for the Age of Mythology Extended Edition that s going to add the Chinese so they ve really taken the success they have had to heart it seems
Yea best strategy game out of like 3 after being out 3 weeks it doesn t surprise me that it already wins because the genre is all but dead
Worthless fan poll from some unknown website Who caresI think if Buster Douglas fought like the same he did against Holyfield then Tyson would KO him The only Buster Douglas that gives Tyson problems is the one that fought Tyson in Tokyo and he never showed up again
Something was off and he wasn t at his best but that was due to his age If you expect Klitschko to turn back the clock and turn it on in a rematch against Fury IMO that can t happen I m just going by Klitschkos 2 past performances he is in decline Don t get me wrong Wlad could turn in a decent performance but IMO the Wlad that clearly outpointed Haye is no longer there I m not sure even if he gives his very best attempt against Fury in a rematch he would win
If Klitschko were to come out in the first round in a Fury rematch like he did in round 12 last night IMO he would get tired very early in the fight
lad was a great Champ and a great fighter but he was incredibly dull outside the ring Most of the time he was dull inside the ring too Let s be honest
On iFLTV Johnny Nelson gave Kugan Cassius a tour of Wladimir s Austria camp and Johnny said Klitschkos ring canvas was spongy soft and roughly 2 inches deep Fighters feet would sink into it as they moved around the ring Johnny s theory was that Klitschko would ve trained on a difficult canvas like that since it would be easier on fight night fighting on a normal canvas however now its obvious what Klitschkos plan was all along
Unfortunately you re a xenophobic racist if you call for a ban on the burqa
I agree Look at how Billy Conn s speed and movement troubled Joe
Fury by split decision I expect Klitschko to look the same as he did against Bryant Jennings i e very normal at times IMO Fury is a much better fighter than Jennings so this is my reasoning for my prediction
Why do you think the talent isn t there He won every round against Dereck Chisora last November Chisora was a world title challenger and was European Heavyweight champion at the time He did the same this year to Christian Hammer who is was ranked in the WBO Top 10 Fury definitely has talent IMO
Floyd will never be top 5 ATG Within the past 30 years alone Roy Jones Ray Leonard and Tommy Hearns rank above him
I heard he was preparing for a possible fight in Canada before he got placed on Cotto Canelo undercard I don t think Rigondeaux only trained for 2 weeks in total before he fought Drian
I d recommend Gurranabraher Not classified as a posh area of Cork City but I lived there for a long time and had no problems with crime Many people leave their cars out on the road without trouble
He didn t have a bad night he knew he was winning every round and so he didn t alter that winning game plan He landed an average of 7 punches every round with a hit rate of 21 and that s ok for him since he won the fight If Rigondeaux landed some punches he d often wait for Drian to throw punches at him Rigo would just stand still and throw absolutely nothing just analyse what Drian would do next Rigo should have been aggressive instead of just waiting for Drian to make mistakes He should ve done something after he landed punches but he did absolutely nothing once he knew he landed his surplus of punches that would win him the round BTW I m not a Rigondeaux hater I was glad he was fighting on HBO again and I thought it was wrong he was dropped outright I was glad once he was announced to be fighting on the card His performance against Donaire was incredible when he knocked down stein Kennedy 5 times that was something I was fond of Rigo However last night was a very big letdown IMO
Have you been able to experience presence
Thurman isn t a powerhouse as he has moved up in class his KO ratio has decreased Whereas you ve guys like GGG and Kovalev who constantly knock out opponents at the top level
Can you use this on your lap
If we see the same Fury who won every round against Chisora and Hammer and if Klitschko looks the same he did against Jennings IMO Fury will win IMO there was a very appearent decline in Klitschkos performance against Jennings he looked very normal at times I think Fury is a much better fighter than Jennings
I think we ll get the announcment December 8th then shipments a week later I think we are used to consoles being announced months ahead of their shipment but with the HTC Vive we ll get a smartphone like launch a sudden announcment then pre orders and shipments very very soon after
Canelo should be fighting at 160lbs he weighs more than GGG on fight night FFS That s the reason he s so ripped having to get down to 155lbs No doubt on fight night when he is 172 or 174lbs he won t look as ripped
rowlodge I can remember roughly 10 months ago hearing a huge very big thud against the back of my house If it hit my window the window would have broken without a single doubt The sound of the thud was like being in a car and the boot being closed very hard Except this sound came from the back of my house bring hit This was around 6 15am Behind my house is very big gymnasium in a building which was closed so people would have had to climb over its steel fence to get to where you could throw something at the back of my house Plus there s security cameras so it d be unwise I didn t look outside since I didn t hear any shouting plus me thinking if somebody threw something at my house surely it d be to break the windows but they weren t broke Also there is a gap of around 20 feet where s they d have to throw the object with the thud I heard throwing an object that d make that noise over that distance would be impossible I heard the loud thud tbh it hit so hard i could practically feel its vibrations However I looked at the back of my house the next day and there was nothing wrong no damage Not to mention no alien objects on the floorIf I get this do I still need to buy the new maps
My wife is a Michigan Grad so I married in I love the school have my whole life but the students are hard to talk to I work with a bunch of recent students and my gosh they need a dose of we all make the same money After 3 5 years this isnt an issue the 30 year old Michigan grads are super cool The fresh grads they need a dose of reality
Holy shit I was calling for Loyd Carr to go because being top 10 wasnt enough I learned my lesson and I hope the entire NCAA did too Lucky for us Loyd was deciding when to retire anyway but my gosh dont make the same mistake
Comcast gave me a cable box with my new service They forced me to take the box or be charged 15 month It will collect dust as I use the cheaper than internet only rate
This is America When 1 person dies from something we ban it
Now it will be illegal Pfff
Blizzard changed the economy games take between 6 and 12 minutes
I m getting outstanding reviews about handling stress at work Worth it
The wins are so satisfying I ll watch the replay do commentary and watch my apm Even my wife will watch
Now is the time to play With the new expansion there are a ton of new players
You didn t notice your mouse accuracy had improved Also nothing stresses me out anymore The sky will be falling at work and I don t get stressed My bosses love my ability to keep calm My motto is ah the test failed Gg queue the next game
20 seconds The game doesn t let you take a 1 second break or you might as well give up
Sc2 has made me so good with the mouse and hotkeys 4 different people have asked me to slow down at work because I made them sick It s addicting because it s making me better at my desk job
Dude the arcade is epic since the new release It s back to wc3 style
I use starcraft as the best break for me I need 8 minutes to mentally restart Starcraft When I m done I m done playing video games I m back to work
You know the rush of doing drugs I feel like that when I play starcraft You are always at 100 when you are in battle you are in pure focus when you lose its crushing When you win you feel like you took over a country It s incredible Plus I m really fast at the computer now People have actually complained about my speed being nauseating
The point is they could have come from space landed on earth and began populating That s the implication
Not a republican Confusing feelings and logic American
I should have given Rich Rod 5 years but it was clear a spread offense in the big 10 means injuries Unlike OSU we don t get to scour the entire state for depth we have to share with MSU It just didnt seem to work Then Hoke the players didnt respect him That was obviousJust do it Don t let your dreams be dreams
He should also record himself playing the game then stream himself watching the previous recording
he haha

Somehow I know what that video is about without even clicking
Most people don t read usernames
I dunno hannaplaysstarcraft sounds like a good name for a boy too Might name mine that if its a boy

This is why it s tagged as fluff EDIT I should clarify it s tagged as fluff because it s fluff content not much else to really describe it
Should be tagged as troll
should be just deleted and account banned
tempting but there s still a chance it s not so it stays until proven other wise Innocent until proven guilty n all that
Hah yeah there s someone who s so new to Starcraft they don t even own the game yet they watch Dreamhack come to this subreddit and post about region locked tournaments
well i play and watch lol and i saw sc2 on twitch s numbers then i wanted to find out about the game so i checked reddit and the first post i saw was about region locked tournaments i thought lol had a worse community but i never got harassed as much as i have in this post when i said i was new on riot s forums
You are underestimating how close League and SC2 scenes are
i like LCS i wish sc2 had something like the lcs but you have asians all over WCS right
They aren t Asian they are Japanese
based
I don t like the generalization of troll they come in many forms we should have more names for them since the worst insult you can give a great troll is a normal or bad troll We need more categories
sad that this is the official post DH that was great thread These threads are an important institution in the sc2 community and express the actual enjoyment of fans who love major sc2 tournaments r starcraft is a mix of a eternal optimists on one hand b kids who think something is more likely to be true if its cynical and negative on the other and c trolls from BW and LOL who love to hate the game and its fans believe me they exist here This has resulted in a pessimistic attitude where negative feelings are upvoted and seen as true Kind of weird for a fanbase would be weird if hockey fans would berate each other for being positive about the game for instance
im sorry for being a happy person i guess the starcraft community does not like happiness
No we just don t like the new accounts that are made after every tournament that post something along the lines of what you posted because most of them are trolls Don t go proving you re one too
uhm wow i thought the starcraft community was meant to be the nicest
lol We are just look at any of the new posts asking about the gaming where people link to the information the OP asks for Now if you re going to buy starcraft and you want some tips want to play with me add me on bnet ibleedorange 1842 I d love to help you get started
Hey mate obviously not the same guy but if your offer extends to other people I m new and willing to learn
If you re brand new I can help but tbh I m still figuring out lotv hard to know when to drone and such as zerg
Brand new to anything Starcraft I ve only done a couple AI games I ve been trying to read up on what I should be doing though I generally learn better from a hands on perspective
I can help with that Might be later tonight tomorrow depending on what I have going on
sorry but id rather my first interaction in the game be with someone that doesnt call me a troll and feels tempted to ban me im used to people being rude on facebook and instagram but i thought starcraft might be more welcoming to new players
Nice dodge
is this how you talk to all women in your life
especially your mom
Uhh he said MOST of them are trolls he never said you re a troll he said don t prove that you are one which you are currently doing right now
yea was checking for the same seemed so fishy
Mickhead your name reminds me of a word that rhymes with your name
Er I think that s the whole point of the name
Dayum son
Fookin rekt m8
ahahha what an epic fake xD
just don t get discouraged when you first start everyone began in bronze league and faced many cheeses and stomps along the way
not true I started out in copper league
2010 kids remember
i actually started in silver league cause i looked up some videos of lokow its hard to keep up tho with all the things you got to learn at the start and i currently have no idea how to hit 150 apm
Camera hotkeys bro
got it for F1 to F5 and mainly use it for Zerg Queen injection D any other good uses
Making sure you re not getting attacked or dropped on keeping up on tumors cycling through different parts of your base to remember to keep upgrades rolling I try to associate each camera hotkey with a small checklist of things that need to be kept up with at each location Helps to break the big to do list into smaller ones and associating each camera with a set of things lets me stay constantly safe while reminding me of everything I need to do just by cycling between cameras
Wow That was really good information
I ve always had a knack for strategy but I m shit at execution had the same problem with Magic the Gathering when I was a kid I was great at building decks and seeing what types of play would work well against other common styles etc but my learning curve was slow when it came to actually playing c Eventually I teamed up with a friend who was great at playing but sucked at deck building started building decks for him and coaching him and splitting tournament prizes when we won Sweet deal
sounds good ill try to implement something like that into my playstyle thanks
I am diamond and I still don t hit 150 My average is around 80 90
Yea read about APM abit and how using control groups will help increase the APM There is a section for advanced uses to improve their APM but i have yet read it as getting used to the micro and control groups for fights is a lot already
Well I don t really mind having such low I just like to demonstrate that APM does not always equals skills I have a friend who is in silber league and keeps nagging about his low apm Yet I will still look into the usage of APM as you suggested
upvoted cause grill Am I in r starcraftcirclejerk
Nice troll thread
Let the downvote come to you dear troll
LOL You are awful
You literally are talking about buying starcraft with an account that has playsstarcraft in the name Try not to be so obvious next time GL in life
its almost like there was a game called broodwar
In the OP you said I think I m going to buy starcraft You never specified SC2 you made it seem you had never played it before
Best purchase of your life I guarantee it
OMG have an upvote for rubbing on a desperate community
lol this sub is so desperate
it s obviously a troll account but people are so insecure about starcraft that they can t see past the idea that a new person has come here to talk about how great starcraft is also resorting to name calling at the expense of people with disabilities is not necessary and also shows how insecure people are about starcraft
You will meet a lot of assholes but I envy yo uthat you can play whole campaign and the whole awesome story awaits you
Sc2 has a much better community than most other games in my experience tbh
Most other FPS s and RTS perhaps Not most other games I ve never seen the attitude Call of Duty or Starcraft players have towards strangers in any MMO I ve played Don t get me wrong this sub is the better part of the community But competitive games bring our competitive people and a lot of competitive people are assholes when they don t have incentive to be nice
In the last week laddering alone I ve had guys messaging me discussing what I did wrong in the game with me There was also a guy wishing me good luck next round after I beat him in automatic tournament I have to say I was really touched by how nice SC people are Sure I will probably meet jerks in the future but laddering SC2 is a positive experience for me
My experience unfortunately tends to be more along the lines of sore winners who decided to harass me even after a game ends people who insult me before the game starts etc Maybe I m just getting the bad end of the stick but it feels like it happens a lot At least co op and the campaign have been harassment free
I m sorry to hear that I hope that you will meet nicer people on the ladder in the future Jerks like that are hopefully just a minority
Try MOBAs
yeah ive seen some of the assholes that responded to this kinda making me regret posting or saying anything
Please don t regret it A lot of people here have insecurity issues and they will try to talk shit ot you so they feel better but they can t do that in the campaign
Do it do it do it
Another lost soul
Can we not upvote this shit This is literally worse than shitposting At least shitposting has an underlining satire to it
You are in for a good time my friend To discover starcraft from the beginning is a wonderful experience GL HF
thanks for the update

ugh what a piece of shit
This is basically a vote for most popular game along the demographic that cares enough about games to go online and vote for them Best game ever will never be something coming out of it
To be fair best game ever will never come out of any poll because it is a subjective thing imo
These contests are worthless Last year a LoL character won the character contest
Wasn t the word of the year an emoticon Haha Nothing holds weight anymore
It might be the best of it s genre or subgenre but it s definitely not the best game ever
But I think we can agree it was a better game than Mass Effect 2 And definitely had a much bigger impact on gaming as a whole
If the criteria is biggest impact on gaming as a whole then you probably would have to go back decades to find the best game ever Games like Pong Space Invaders Pacman Tetris or something like that I don t have great knowledge of the early days of gaming In modern times I guess maybe Minecraft is a good candidate Looking at the games involved in this contest makes it quite clear why there s no reason to bother with it though
Might not be a popular opinion but halo 2 cemented online gaming for consoles was very impactful Edit I d vote for it in the impact category
Using that logic candy crush is the best game ever
Candy Crush hasn t had a particular big impact on gaming as a whole It s had a big impact on the financial side of it perhaps but that would simply be high on the list of best games ever for game publishers wallets Hell Candy Crush as a game has probably had zero impact on gaming outside of spawning a ton of copies Candy Crush itself is a copy of an old formula though so it s just copies of a copy
ME2 was a TPP RPG Shooter StarCraft is an RTS It s impossible for me to decide which of these is better because those are 2 completely different genres and fanboys will vote for the game they prefer not the one that is better Also we d have to decide what is better plot ME2 wins here for me Gameplay Look up different genres Competitiveness SC all the way
I don t know I love both Starcraft series and Mass Effect series And honestly can t decide which is better as I have hard time comparing between different genres
not sure we can to be honest
http www gamefaqs com features bge20 vote Actual link for the lazy
Damn Mass Effect fans
I ll be damned if Starcraft loses to Mass Effect
Annnnd we lost
Not just that ME2 which IMO was the worst big picture story of the series The interpersonal stories where great making Jacobs father kill himself is something I ll always remember That being said I don t think I ll ever replay it while SC I still bring to LAN parties and play to this day
How the fuck isn t broodwar winning by a massive land slide
Maybe because its not as good as you guys think
It defined an entire genre and started esports as we know it did ME2 do that
Mainstream bad people anyone u can think of that s not particularly good in a game will vote for those big titles or nostalgic But if it had some algoritim to it and people knew how good it was when it was out it d win by a landslide It s kind of like an irl problem doctors surgeons people with long education all agree that vaccines and stuff is super safe and good for kids But some youtube famous mom lifetime blogger and poodle lover gets the same airtime on the news on how it s extremely bad and how her child got Aspergers from it Now everyone who watches it over 40 female and like poodles will take her side Ok that s a terrible analogy but I m really tired so that ll have to do lol Tl dr if people had more knowledge about games scbw would be winning
Tetris got the worst seed getting Pokemon Red Blue in first round
As much as I love and played the hell out of SC in this context I can t vote for it over FFVII x
Did my part do yours
Cmon guys you don t even need an account to vote Just 2 clicks
You don t but come on these kind of threads show pretty much how dumb these polls are Whichever game gets the most traction in reddit threads and stuff like that wins And what do I really get from StarCraft I winning Some weird validation that a game I played a lot as a kid and revisit once per half year or something won what is not even a popularity contest I mean this isn t even a popularity contest any more this is just whichever game has the most thread on fora like reddit like this wins So really I think it s pretty dumb and I m honestly wondering what people hope to achieve by their favourite games winning these kinds of silly polls
I think you are reading too much into this As you said it s a silly poll for the fun nobody should be looking validation of anything
Then why are you stressing so much that we have to participate as if anything meaningful comes from it
Because it costs me nothing to vote and some people may enjoy it if Starcraft wins
Yes so why do they enjoy it That s the weird validation part
But it s not even the best RTS ever
Curious what would you pick over it Total Annihilation AoE2
Both of those are more worthy contenders SC1 isn t even the best RTS by Blizzard I would certainly put WC3 over it I know SC2 hasn t gotten an incredible reception from long time SC1 fans but from a technical standpoint it mops the floor with SC1
Sorry bud your 90 s RTS hasn t held up like you think it has The competitive scene went to SC2 and then it died There really isn t a single thing SC1 did well that hasn t been done better by other RTS games
Name one single feature of SC1 that you enjoy and I promise you I can find another game that s done it better
Constantly evolving meta for 10 years without patches with no race ever becoming unbeatable
What s happened in the last year to make the meta still evolving
By far the best SC feature I enjoy is that it provided material for tournaments and competitive community Now of course if you are only going to list games in the 90s I can point to many more purely technical features like the ratio graphics system requirements user interface strategy depth hell even the story was quite good although C C probably beats it
I found a newb he s right here
I played SC1 BW for several years from release in my late teens and it consumed my life to some extent and I honestly think SC2 is a better game BW will probably always have had a bigger impact on my life due to the time in my life it came out but just because it s insanely impressive to watch top players manage things like shitty pathing Dragoons destroying gaming mouses for over a decade or get around scarabs getting stuck on mineral lines etc it s not something that speaks in the favor of the game in terms of best game in my opinion It s not that I blame the game for things that in large comes down to limitation of hardware the games of that time period etc it s an amazing game with an amazingly interesting esports competitive gaming legacy It will always be one of the games I have the fondest memories of but I do consider Sc2 the better game I m sure that pisses off a lot of BW elitists hell I was one back in the days that are in this thread looking at comments that are being downvoted but can t let fanboism silence other opinions
It doesn t quite work like that in my head you have to take into account when it got released If not everything that came before us is super piss Even many of the greatest thinkers to have ever lived doesn t meassure up to a bright wiz kid age 19 not even when they were at their peak Look at anything in sports if you look at the fastest people could run 90 years ago Feats deemed impossible one guy did it like the 4 minute mile then shortly after people started trickling in Now you won t even get into the top sports gymnasium if you can t already do that etc When sc bw came out many people quickly realized that this was the Holy Grail of games and never before have anyone as far as we know it in the entirety of the human race made a game that challenging that competitive and that exciting And it stood the test of time not a 1 month game or a 6 month game it kept going strong for over a decade And any other rts game after it will always be meassured up against it Hell even with sc2 they literally copied everything from scbw and tried to improve upon it Most of the units are the same the mineral idea the gas idea almost identical So I get where you re coming from but scbw has to be nr1 rts game of all time I also agree that sc2 now is better and cooler than bw but if you compare how sc2 feels now and how it impacts the world now compared to how scbw felt during it peaks it s a landslide difference That being said only my opinion But I d like to think it carries some weight
Yes it is
Yeah popular vote nothing more Seriously who the fuck cares about gamefq Just look at that website SC will win because they haven t upgraded their database since 1998 4Head
This vote is so bad Final Fantasy X over Half Life is alright but weird Sonic The Hedgehog 2 over Portal 2 is a huge stretch Skyrim over GoldenEye 007 is a stretch Metal Gear Solid V over Perfect Dark is laughable Chrono Cross over Wold of Warcraft is cringe worthy And Mass Effect 2 beating out Starcraft is just plain dumb
FFX is great and FF fans are diehard and Half Life is overrated Sonic 2 was huge and console defining and while Portal 2 is also good it s not a stretch at all Skyrim is an amazing game who many consider one of the best games of the decade while Goldeneye was definitely revolutionary for shooters and nostalgic for many Skyrim is current and fresh in peoples minds MGSV sold as many copies in the first five days of its release than Perfect Dark has in its lifetime and the Metal Gear series is a powerhouse while Perfect Dark isn t Chrono Cross is great and WoW is a very insular game in the sense that a lot of people don t like MMOs or WoW in general WoW has a lot of haters that would vote against it just because of what it is even if they re not really fans of CC Mass Effect 2 was hugely popular I would hope Starcraft would win over it but I could see why people would vote for ME2 RTS is a pretty niche genre
Most of them I understand While I understand Skyrim has more fans than Goldeneye I ll never understand why Skyrim has fans Without the mod community it s an overall pretty average game Not the best open world game ever by any means but certainly in the year it came out That s about it though
Why is Mass Effect beating Starcraft just plain dumb Mass Effect is hugely popular and one of the best stories I ve ever experienced Be honest it s miles above Starcraft s storyline and I mean absolutely no disrespect to SC when I say that
Starcraft 1 and Brood war had a better story than mass effect 2 and SC2 didn t butcher the bw story as badly as the ending to mass effect 3 butchered the story of mass effect 2 Also the story is the primary aspect of mass effect 2 but multiplayer was the primary part of brood war
Because Mass Effect didn t create an entire subculture of people becoming professional gamers in Korea For me I look at how good a game is by the effect it had on the culture and influence it had on future games not just by how much I enjoyed it personally
I ve lived through a lot of ded gaem shitposts in my time but I don t think I can handle muh brood war losing to a slapped together incomplete EA cash in title that would ultimately prove 100 irrelevant to the franchise s plot and sound the death knell of Bioware as a respected consumer conscious developer EDIT muh brood war
rip brood war
I made a post on the previous thread about this mass effect 2 being overrated and got some downvotes and replies like it s a masterpiece Idk man
oh shit people having opinions different to your own D
Well they should have gone with wc3 broodwar isnt that game hyped by its fanboys

Don t know how to link times 01 18 38 http www twitch tv dreamhacksc2 v 27878343
Much gratitude
best series ever
sorry i cant tell the difference between korean vs korean and foreigner vs foreigner guys
it is harder to tell start of the game but it becomes quite apparent when it goes to the later game atleast in some of the spots and how they proceed i don t think there is any Terrans outside of Korea who can do what Ty did late game on that gold map
Thanks for the laugh Let the foreign lovers keep their games as they Think there are no difference and we go for hyped crazy games like this
don t forget to clean up after yourself when you re done masturbating
I sure will But I hope people understand my comment mostly was to mock those people that keep say that more foreigner will give more viewers Did I enjoy Huks first winner interview I sure did But its for games like TY vs Parting Im watching and even if people doesnt like to admit they usually come from koreans
Some guys mostly play this game reaching Gold Plat Diamond some guys just spend time in twitch chat get that GM understanding of the game but just can t break bronze because of time cheeses balance
you have to consider that the game is fairly new for everyone
Question about Huk is he good at LOTV or only archon mode
Hes pretty good actually Not amazing but good
top N A probably top 15 tosses in the world
I think PuCK is better right now for NA protoss but both are playing well And like MAYBE top 15 in the world We haven t seen a lot of Korean players yet
yea like top 15 ATM in like 3 months not so much
Sucks because HuK has potential to be such a good player I really hope he keeps practicing hard Love seeing him play well
problem is his late game mechanics and the fact that toss is so fucking hard to play ive been a fan of his since beta
I think his unit control is weak but he has super good decision making
cmon he has like top 3 control
early game his micro is good i wish he scouted more
Really I haven t watched him much since WoL but I always felt the opposite He seemed to thrive in the early game with lots of micro but would fall apart as the game went on All his builds seemed to rely on early damage too But maybe he is a different player now than I remember
I mean he still has this a bit and tends to be aggressive but I find it s his control that usually screws him Idk tho I m bad at the game
Good at archon mode with MC I m pretty sure I could even win if MC was my archon partner
why do you think he is good at all
He beat Avilo
my bad missed that series
watching koreans play is awesome foreigners have no chance is hell against them in this game though
Some BS play from Parting I wnet into the dinning room where my friends were I say There is a god And he plays Starcraft Loving tonight
Are they still friends with you
Felt so bad for Ty after that and I don t even like Terran
I m not the biggest HuK fan but I m happy that he s doing his best to hype LotV STARCRAFT IS ALIVE
The technology for a good game just isn t there yet
I see where HuK is going with this He is within reach of the Twitter Championship
PvP is a joke right now
More begging for hype for the SC2 community Sad to see
hey this is a guy with a checkmark LOOK AT THIS POPULAR OPINION upvotes to the left
calm you tits ffs
Meh I m really not impressed Adding 300 actions a minute to a game of rock paper scissors still makes it rock paper scissorsbiggest reason i see is there are too many long breaks in between matches Nobody wants to watch nothing especially with the horrible edm they have playing I get the schedule bit but if it causes viewers to have to sit there for 30 minutes doing nothing u cant expect viewers to just stay I myself turned the stream off will just watch the vods when they come out Got better things to do with my time
This was my first SC2 tournament that I attempted to watch and the breaks of nothing but crap was killing me I kept on leaving to go do something else and when i come back to check on it they were nearly ending the next game It s just as if not much effort or thought has been put into making the stream enjoyable to the viewers EDIT Just fixing my typo
Yeah it sad how dreamhack does this I barely watch any dreamhacks anymore I prefer to watch IEMs or wcs instead
People can say what they will about Riot cutting out most 3rd parties but at least they re consistent 3 4 mins of downtime with analysis and interviews taking up the rest And ADs are extremely rare can t beat that
Make sure to watch WCS Generally way better production quality and less downtime Honestly Dreamhack was also much better during its heyday I remember some tourneys used to have 3 or 4 streams and although they might have some downtime 1 was almost always active Then they would cut almost all downtime for the grand finals What can I say I m really nostalgic for that 2011 2013 era when SC2 was the number 1 esport I know that SC2 doesn t need 120k viewers to be fun for those who are watching but it makes me sad Huk is right the game has never been better and it s a shame more people aren t seeing it
i agree ive watched probably every event from qualifiers to the big show i never have a problem watching those This DH i just cant sit thru the whole thing Hope those at DH will review the event with viewers comments so that next time it ll only be better
I have the same problem with anything If I m not entertained for more than 30 sec tops I m outta there doesn t matter even if it s porn I leave
Get livestreamer open up all the DH streams Switch between when games end works OK enough But I definitely agree too long breaks and no countdown kills enjoyment
Aside from scheduling I do agree If you are going to have downtime set up a couch and have lax interviews on it with everyone including random fans Do we always have to do the same old boring interview format every tourny Smix does a great job but it s just so bleh especially when the players aren t into it Take 3k out of the prizepool and use it to buy a couch and maybe 2gd or some other interesting personality
I ve been saying this for the last couple years Who has the time and patience to sit through a 10 minute be right back screen with terrible music 15 minutes of casters and experts who circle jerk each other and love to hear themselves talk and then another 10 minutes of a be right back screen for what could be a 10 minute match
Lol true that I turned it off and played sc instead when the awful edm came on
They need to take a page from dota and probably others and have analysts between games that understand the finer points and talk about what happened and why and what to expect next game The analysts in Dota are mostly not even casters they re just former pros or people who have proven to know what they are taking about statisticians etc that can create content besides music between games
WCS does this too It s a dreamhack problem
That is what made day 9 great good entertainment but not softening down on the game I fell since then people try to dump down the game
So true I switch streams and sometimes I forget to switch back
It should have been on 4 12 CET not 10 6 CET
Yeah I caught the tail end of it after coming home from work
Lucky you it was already over by the time I got home
I thought they were going to keep it late like the first day so i missed a lot
I came back home from school 9 till 6 Remembered day 2 dreamhack was live but got disappointed
C mon so many excuses around here Do you guys think that it is these microfactors that caused the low viewership Or is it the low playerbase All the signs are around you Look at the average subscribers who frequent this sub Then compare to CSGO Look at the playerbase Then compare to LoL Look at the number of custom games being played in the client Look at whether SC2 is even on the front page of twitch when no tournaments are on We are so in denial it s sad
Blizzcon viewership did peak at 143k Average viewership was 84k http www fuzic nl events 6327 wcs
You re completely missing the point This is not about Viewership numbers compared to LoL or DotA why are you bringing this in It s about viewership compared to past tournaments And it s pretty much always been the case that EU has the strongest SC2 viewership so running at completely abysmal times for EU citizens hurts the viewership numbers naturally It is also pretty terrible for NA viewers too and they also make up quite a large portion of the viewership and let s be real koreans aren t really watching SC2 Considering this the fact that still 40k people tuned in at peak so far is pretty cool for SC2
I actually think that timing makes a huge difference For Americans loads of us are on Thanksgiving break and we don t wake up early in the morning to watch Starcraft Put it in our afternoon and you ve got double or triple the viewers
Yeop a single League streamer can pentuple normal tournament viewership and fuck it scheduling Sure scheduling didn t help but SC2 is a very particular game for a much more particular sort of person than this sub thinks There was a recent thread on r askreddit along the lines of what s the most stressful experience in gaming and the top response was Starcraft 2 RTS is just a way less accessible and immediately appealing genre than the MOBA or the FPS The learning curve is totally incomparable It s super unfortunate too because as many people have echoed LOTV is really entertaining to watch and to play
Sc2 is stressful I love it but I barely play it anymore cause of ladder anxiety And it s not even about the rank I m diamond and that is never going to change so I don t care about the rank but the game stresses me out Even in dota where I do care more about my mmr I don t have as much stress It s just a game that appeals to a niche crowd It can t be the biggest esport as good of a game as it is I moved to dota for both the game and esport scene a while ago and even though it hurt to let go of sc2 I feel like it needed to be done
DotA can be stressful but there are lulls in the action to let you catch your breath or a take a sip of coffee tea vodka without fucking over the game When you die you have to wait a significant amount of time before respawning During that time you can act as an extra pair of eyes for your team and watch battles taking place Heck even if you don t die walking back to base to heal gives you a break from the action Starcraft gives you zero breathing room You have to constantly click click click just to maintain baseline unit production If you lose a fight you cannot take a breather because you d just lose faster You cannot afford to watch battles in Starcraft because to do so would mean giving up unit production to watch things blow up Starcraft games are much shorter compared to DotA games but they give you no time to rest This is what makes it so stressful
It amuses me that having teammates makes people so much more comfortable with losing Is it just that you like having someone to blame when you lose in DOTA but you have no one to blame but yourself in 1v1 I can kinda relate to the concept of ladder anxiety but I only get it when solo queuing dota and I literally stems from the fear of having awful teammates In sc2 im much more comfortable spam queuing because my losses are 100 avoidable pending how well I play and I can leave whenever I want where in dota I might get a peruvian pudge mid thats gonna curse at me in spanish all game and potentially keep me stuck in a losing game for 40 minutes
I think one big thing in Dota and similar games is that you can die If you die you have to wait some time and therefore you can t do anything While this can be frustrating it is also a time where you can relax and calm down In Starcraft you always have to give 100 effort while in other games you have breaks In my opinion this is the main reason why Starcraft is way more stressful than other games
This is a really important point Think about activity during a game like Dota You lane you have a teamfight you go clear wards you buy at the shop you die There are highs and lows moments of rest and moments of action There s a flow to it Starcraft while from a viewer s perspective has a flow is all action all the time for the player When s the last time you sat back and took a deep breath without doing anything in Starcraft The answer s probably never because you could be optimizing something Probes and pylons Run some lings by their third to see if you can snipe some workers Scan the gold to make sure they didn t sneak a base The minute you load into that Starcraft game you re committing to play at 100 for a very long time And for a lot of people hell most people that s extremely difficult
The question is if this can be changed or if this is just one thing inherent to the RTS genre I loved playing Age of Empires 2 when I was younger but I never really liked Starcraft For me it was always to fast AoE was also fast and stressful but I always had the feeling that there were times where I could relax a bit and had not much to do For me a as a casual player this was great and I never felt AoE games even if they took 4 hours as stressful as Starcraft 2 games Don t know if there is any truth to this feeling or if it is just subjective
My solo queue anxiety in Dota is purely down to the number of Russians I may have on my team
People find comfort in eachother in all sorts of situations it s not about blame
Not just the rts genre I ve played other rts games that didn t feel half as stressful
Heck when I was watching a RUNESCAPE streamer Boaty had 19k viewers while dreamhacksc2 had 17k viewers
I agree 100 The nature of RTS is that it is balanced and designed to be a single player game that by itself I think makes it much less accessible When the playerbase is relatively thin the interest for the pro scene continues to be thin new expansion or not In a MOBA or a FPS you and 4 friends can just queue up and most likely get matched against similar skilled opponents and still have a great time I think there are two reasons 1 These genres are arguably more intuitive CSGO shoot the 5 opposing players with gun of choice 2 Less punishing Bad mechanics and poor decision making in Dota 2 for example does not necessarily have to have any negative impact on the fun you with your friends can have The heroes and the items makes the game have infinite replayability The game enables creativity I wan t go Shadow Blade and gank In SC2 you can do some sick wonky build but is that as easy to pull of and figure out just with the information the game provides as a noobie My experience of 1v1 Starcraft ladder as a newcomer being Silver is that I get shat on during the first 5 minutes more often than not and have go again and play the same game without having a chance to figure out what I am doing right and wrong It s only so much fun to get beat in a row I have also tried 2v2 with a friend to make playing the game more fun because I really do like to play the game but after the initial 5 placement games me and my friend got queued up agains plat and diamond players who I guess where messing around in 2v2 I had this same experience in HotS also while in Dota smurfs are rarely scene I love watching pro SC2 and I used to follow the scene a long time without ever really becoming even decently good at the game but when tournament lacks players I recognize casters I enjoy and other personalities Day9 Incontrol Rotti I just don t watch I am sure others feel the same We just tune in to Blizzcon or other major events
That s actually surprising to me sc2 is relaxing cause its just you vs the opponent but league is stressful aa fuck cause you have 4 people up your ass every time you make a mistake I agree that they havent done enough to cater to the casual scene though Where are the skins Voice packs A good arcade mode with custom games actually promoted by blizz
Yeah I barely play the game anymore but stayed subbed I ve watched this subreddit go into complete denial about the Starcraft scene Posts about how the game is under appreciated got way more frequent as did posts about drama between players
I don t really care about the other games I was just at work for almost all the DH matches Like almost everyone I know would be from noon till late afternoon on a workday Unless they were hoping for a lot of Asian viewers I honestly don t know how they expected anyone to watch this
Yea yea all those games are bigger wah wah wah Who cares Most people know sc2 isn t the biggest game out there anymore But these points people make have an impact on viewership there is no denying that I have t been able to watch anything of this tournament since its over by the time im home And no im not claiming we would reach 100k this way but it would sure as hell be more than we have now
Or you know people have other things to do during the Thanksgiving holiday season like shopping
thanksgiving is like the superbowl nobody outside the u s gives a single shit about it
I am fairly sure more people outside the US give a shit about the superbowl than thanksgiving
Apprently unless they re CSGO or Dota viewers
The dota subreddit is claiming dead game with our viewership as well for what it s worth It should be noted that we have literally only one good team playing in the tournament as well OG the current world champs
excuse after excuse after excuse after excuse The game s just not popular don t make it even more sad by making excuses LITERALLY every tournament
what does he expect dreamhacks production is pathetic for some reason they schedule their event to start in the morning on a weekday and end before the evening even if i wanted to watch the 1 hour pauses dreamhacks main stream is knowen for i couldnt even watch it because of the schedule The main streams ignores most of the bracket goes into hourlong pauses when games are going on and end their stream before all groups are decided Im surprised anyone actually bothered to watch it
well to be honest they always had this problem the production on the main stage has always been good but everything before that was always kinda meh
Schedule is absolutely a huge culprit GSL and Proleague have consistently some of the best play in the scene but the air times are just disastrously inconvenient for EU and NA It can t be helped but it impacts viewership greatly For some reason this Dreamhack runs for East Coast NA from 8 AM to 2 PM For the West Coast that s 5 AM to 11 AM That s when pretty much everyone is either sleeping or at school or work Considering Thanksgiving it s probably sleeping
Shit schedule for EU as well Considering the scheduling I m surprised they got more than 10k viewers
Also thanksgiving weekend in NA
Canadian thanksgiving is in october
Production quality has a marginal effect on viewership It s not like 100k people would be watching if it was nfl league of Legends ultra pro levels of production It s simply not smart to invest like Dota 2 hearthstone csgo levels of production for a game that draws so few viewers Where as if dream hack csgo production is bad you could actually lose like 2x max school viewers in people that just won t care to watch But for csgo those numbers are marginal
Its simply not smart to have bad production If you decide to run a sc2 dota passionstone event and to sell your brand in this case Dreamhack plus sponsors etc you want to have the best possible production Its not like tennis has worse tv production because it has less viewers than soccer IEM is the best example Their production is great no matter what game except if their are production issues but those are never game related Also this event gets more viewers than many other sc2 DHs some of them had even better production
Honestly feels like Dreamhack is merely keeping sc2 on their lineup because blizzard is paying for the stuff Their focus was on csgo and dota2 and it shows on their streams Until the sc2 stream numbers explode i doubt Dreamhack will do much more than what were seeing Why put sc2 on the main stage at prime time when you could get double with a popular title like csgo in its place So sc2 just gets relegated to off times
Your logic does not make sense Why is there a melee event at DH then With 30k prize pool and good production if they dont get 400k viewers like csgo Why is there even volleyball competition why is not everyone holding soccer tournaments those are more popular anyways Because those are all different markets The guy who watches melee might not watch lol dota etc and same goes for sc2 DH would lose me and many others as viewers because we dont care for any other game they offer So if they were to drop sc2 they would lose a whole community I wouldnt say its impossible that they do it if sc2 drops much lower in viewers its likely but the comparison with other titles in nonsensical If it is worth it in itself they will continue to hold events if not then not LoL could have 100 million viewers and there would still be sc2 events
Would you prefer worse production or no SC2 Because I honestly feel like for dreamhack that s probably the consideration They can t justify spending that much money on SC2 anymore They would see likely ZERO shift in sponsor income or anything like that if they dropped SC2 entirely But it costs them money to put on the event
Did you even read what i wrote If its not worth it they wont do an event sure But once any organization decides that their product is viable they try to make it a good product If in country A samsung is not selling many TVs compared to their competitors they only have a 5 market share They wont all of a sudden say ha lets give them shitty TVs not many people buy them anyways And to answer you question if DH production becomes even worse i would prefer they would drop it because then the viewers would go elsewhere and turn to a competitor who does a better job Like Gfinity for example not even sure how good gfinity production was was just to give an example
It wasn t that great in scheduling for EU People who work or go to school missed half of those days Today I could only catch Firecake qualifying AWESOMEKappa
It wasn t just bad scheduling for EU it also started way to early in NA and ended before 11am on the west coast
And on a Friday when NA was either working at school or were up late for Thanksgiving Black Friday
You said it far far better than I ever could Black Friday indeed That kills viewership for nigh any event
Yeah I woke up at 9am ready to watch a day full of SC action and it was over in like an hour disappointed to say the least
it started at like midnight here in australia couldnt watch more than one game
yeah I am watching replays now very excited but its early morning on a holiday weekend for the US No way any of us are awake
same here from germany and could catch like 1 and 1 2 games
Not saying the times were not bad but CS still pulled 200 000 viewers How many did SC pull I m genuinely curious
On the bright side the time is good for Korean and Chinese time zones The Chinese stream got 130 000 to 150 000 concurrent views
People always say this no matter what time it is set for
they actually started before gsl proleague normally start add super long breaks competition from all games that are present at dh and the fact that most sc2 viewers are mid twenty or older then you have low viewers
Yup Just straight at work for both days I don t really get it Who can watch hours of a tournament during the day on a workday
Unfortunately most people have moved on Too little too late from Blizzard
As someone who visits this reddit for nostalgic reasons I have to upvote
lotv is so much better of a game the bad time for NA viewers combined with the low quality so far of the camera work has been disappointing I have no doubt the next IEM will be much bigger more successful WCS should also be much bigger It s sad to say but sometimes I feel like DH doesn t deliver what IEM does in terms of quality and professionalism in addition to this the fact that lotv is so much more of a fun game with a much wider appeal means that we have a lot of room to grow as a community
This was the worst timing for NA viewers I hadn t even checked anything SC2 related for the last few days because I m visiting family for Thanksgiving and unfortunately I don t think I will ever be able to convince my family to watch Starcraft with me over watching football
I agree DH has been kinda meh no big stage no crowd just 4 dudes casting from a desk all day long Sad cause the games are so sick most fun ive had watching sc2 since 2011 Funny cause in 2011 2012 you would be hung for saying this
That and the huge amounts of downtime with awful dubstep music instead of the dank meme videos Dreamhack used to play that used to be Dreamhacks thing Rip Robert Ohlen DaFeels
There was still tons of downtime and awful music when Robert was running things
That was before Twitch got serious about copyright DH probably didn t ever have the proper rights to those songs videos
I miss Robert Ohlen Stuff just didn t seem the same without him there D
It s sad to say but sometimes I feel like DH doesn t deliver what IEM does in terms of quality and professionalism Why do you think that is For Dreamhack their biggest draw is CSGO especially with 2 Swedish teams Then there is LoL and Dota 2 the 2 big MOBAs who are very popular despite the actual tournament not having the best teams and prestige Hearthstone is the fourth biggest game but Heroes of the Storm is quite popular too So now you have SC2 which is either the fifth biggest title or possibly even lower Dreamhack has 2 more games Super Smash and Street Fighter I m not even sure if they are ahead of SC2 or not Either way SC2 is the least favorite game or at best the 3rd least favorite game at Dreamhack No wonder it get s the low production value and budgets Even if it had great production value on par with WCS and the prime time of Dreamhack scheduling how many more viewers are we talking about Maybe it goes from 25k to 40k Still can t beat what CSGO get s at its lows of Dreamhack
BIGGER PIE BIGGER SLICE
Yes but does that make my statement any less true I m well aware of the possible reasons for the low quality of the stream
Actually I am more disappointed by the analysts and casters at Dreamhack for SC2 They simply haven t built up enough hype and storylines to keep the viewership entertained and interested
Yeah I also agree snute and Nate are doing a good job Idk what is up with Apollo
I agree on that WCS will be bigger but I wouldn t be so sure about next IEM Only LoL and CS GO are mentioned in the IEM Katowice announcement http en intelextrememasters com news intel extreme masters to return to katowice for the world championship There will be probably be season IEM 10 finals for sc2 in Katowice but I think it will be a smaller production similiar to this DH event I also think people should remember that currently sc2 is only like 4th most important game to Dreamhack Other games will have priority for better production and time slots
I m not sure what he was expecting
Blizzard s actions to save this game has been too little and too late unfortunately It is what it is and there s very little they can do to create hype or bring in more players and viewers Just gotta be happy with what we got and hope for the best
The marketing wasn t there and the game fundamentally isn t interesting now that the BW enthusiasm died Think liquid s decision to move DotA to a separate site from StarCraft probably hurt even if it was good for the user experience Great campaigns though
It s heartbreaking to think about how much blizzard failed this game
Populism is a nice thing right By the way Valve didnt gave a shit about CS GO for a long time The only thing that worked was Skins
After googling that I suppose it is To me I m just tired of giving fucks knowing full well that any significant changes will take months if not years if ever I m tired of feeling so strung up on my passion and getting so little out of it Same goes for skins and voice packs How was this NOT part of the release to show the direction SC2 is going Instead all we have are promises and the numbers 2016 next to it
Maybe just grumpy Smix is flirting with all of these new up and coming Protosses
at the end of the day the most viewership will correlate to the amount of players who play 1v1 ladder When you get descriptions like OMG lotv so fast paced exciting what people don t realize that people don t want to play games that stresses them out All ins are abundant and way too strong to hold off even if you know they are coming In lotv there Are still deathballs if you ve played TvZ you feel like as time goes on the games gets exponentially worse for you
I had hope for lotv But the changes blizzard implemented did nothing to fix the fundamental issues we ve been complaining about for years
Which is odd because the fundamental problems for League of Legends and Dota are actually the player themself Or do people play with against bots nowadays
I m Z coming back from a break since 2013 and i fuckin hate this roach ravager bullshit but i can t win with ling bling muta because larvae sucks
well you can t expect viewership when it s at ungodly hour We are at work school Needs to be when everyone s off Like 6PM PST Oh look at the downvotes I get it I get it it s not possible to satisfy every possible timezone But seriously come on Who s gonna watch when it s more like Korean Timezone they catered to
Koreans too busy playing blade n soul Which isn t a bad game by any means its actually awesome but the switch is extreme atm from sc2 to any other popular game in korea
Really what do the PC Bang numbers say Has LoTV dropped off
Looks like Blade and Soul is the 8th ranking game now in PC bangs Sc Bw is 4th LotV isn t in the top 10
Always amazed when I see games from the 90s or early 00s like WC3 making their rankings
oh ya is this game like an MMO or perhaps similar to D3
MMORPG with combat that looks action based
Isn t 12 00 CET the time Dreamhack events have always started at I m pretty sure the days always finished around 22 00 23 00 How can you say that they re catering to the Korean time zone when all the other games follow roughly the same schedule Games like CS which aren t big at all in Korea Plus it s not really that nice watching games at 3AM if you got shit to do the next day I m in Korea and I m missing everything because of it
I didn t even know it was going on
Yesterday in the evening for me was like finally i can sit down and watch some DH wait what they are already done for today wtf
ITT people pretend that quality of stream and schedule matters so much Game was pretty much dead in HoTS what the hell did you expect No one but blizzard is to blame
Sure it s in a slump but I m fairly certain that better production and a more accessible schedule for NA would at least help a little hell it would at least allow me to watch it live
It was always like that on big events even back in WCG days early 00s top games and hyped up upcoming ones get the best treatment The old ones that are on decline well you get the drift
Maybe the first 2 60 games should have been better
HotS was 40
It was 60 in Australia so he s technically right hhuehuehue
Then wouldn t WoL have been 80 or 90 in Australia Basically the video game market hates Australia
Yep you can only mess up the game so long before people stop giving you the benefit of the doubt
If the game isn t great for 5 years straight and then all of a sudden becomes great it will take a while for the community to come back assuming they will RTS genre hasn t been the most liked the last years
Tough to believe that you d get good numbers at DH So many games being cast Right now they are running CSGO DOTA2 PassionStone and Heroes of the Storm at the same time as SC2 Also I don t sense a lot of fan favorites still alive in the tournament
Well known foreigner draw viewership right
To be fair DH Stockholm viewership was a lot worse Though that wasnt lotv
Dreamhack and IEM events usually have this friday and sometimes thursday daytime scheduling which is terrible for viewers This is because they are not primarily e sports events they are tournaments attached to a LAN or a trade show How anyone can still not be aware that viewers are low on these days and additionally they can t change these days is mind boggling How long have they been doing this stuff
Here is why i am barely watching dream hack casters are annoying as hell maybe except nate smix sucks as an interviewer i don t feel like sitting through all the down time and i only care to see TY Parting and Solar play
I personally really hate player interviews There s way too many and they really not interesting and awkward What do they expect Just let them play already
All I can think of when watching this DH is how unprofessional it is It s not like crazy bad but man Can t these casters just set aside whatever it is there is between them and not repeatedly try to put each other in awkward moments be a team player caster and just talk StarCraft It s a DH Not Homestory Cup Nate is pretty much the only one who s there that feels that he went to DreamHack to CAST whereas the rest most of them are just going along for the paycheck ride Smix hasn t improved much since last time she did this kind of gig but then again there are very few people with her skills who can do the job so good for her hope she keeps it up
yeah the caliber of players for this tournament just isn t there
WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL SNUTE ANNOYING GRRR I never jeesh
Yeah she is so bad She should be a translator only like she was before but I guess it would be weird to give her her old position back
Personally for me Smix was a highlight of the show Her interviews were Oscar worthy compared to the many other DH issues like downtime camerawork lighting timing and commentary Guess we all have our preferences
But i like sleeping in
The problem with the Dreamhack Format is that you have no idea what Games are played There are too many random Games and no one knows what Games are being played I only watched TY vs Bomber on VOD because I missed it and when I watched it live some random PvZ was playing
While I agree it is low I do think for the first time in a long time SC2s audience will grow I know a ton of people who are getting into it because of co op and ARCHON and such But yeah in America Canada its at such bad hours its hard to catch Most people at work or school
As a person that follow most things from Korea GSL Proleague etc I can t say that this lineup made me any exicted it s just not the people I like to watch I m still watching as it s the first LotV tournament but mostly to see Solar TY and Parting I think a lot of people may start to watch and then quit too It s a lot of downtime and nothing fun between games
There is too much downtime between games I kept going back to Heroes of the Storm during the horrendous wait times Also noted Heroes had more viewers than SC2 O
If you put a tournament on thanksgiving you are going to have bad viewership
Didnt stop the other games also at DH from getting a lot of viewers
Other games aren t in the position of starcraft plus they did noticeably have less viewership than average
ITT americans thinking they would be really relevant Nobody gives a shit about that day except you
I agree the games were pretty amazing and the game is even better On a positive note as the game is better it will rise
It would be great if the matches doesn t end by the time i got home from work
To be fair It started at 4 AM Central during a holiday weekend
Really bad timeslot combined with low production quality I mean yesterday they randomly ended the stream while multiple games still had to be played breaks have no countdown timer and terrible music fucking super load wubwub after someone wins a game which hurts your ears casters sitting in some dark cupboard with bad lighting Meanwhile heroes of the storm has a beautiful stage and half our viewers during the time SC2 was on
I m enjoying the tournament but it s a bit looser and more casual than usual Its fun to see casters joking around but joking they don t know the maps isn t so funny Its a new game new units new maps and it just came out for all of us and instead of experts analysing informing and bringing viewers up to speed they re just kidding around Huk s been the most passionate person involved and that s been great to see
I think this has a lot to do with the time the matches are being played and the fact that it s a holiday weekend in the US
this will get downvoted into oblivion but I m still going to say it SC2 is brutal compared to other e sports games and most people the casual base isn t interested in investing so much time into it to get better at it So hearthstone LoL csgo will stay more popular unfortunately
I agree People watch the game they are playing not the game fun to watch I don t think HS is better game to watch than SC2 but HS has far bigger viewer number And there are at least 1million player in Lotv but most of them are campaign only players they are not interested in competitive scene This may be the biggest difference between SC2 and other major e sports title
HS has the benefit of casual players being able to compete with top players For example I only play occasionally but my friend that reaches legend rank GM equivalent kind of usually ends up going 60 40 win loss when we play each other Now imagine even a moderate SC2 player going up against a pro player They would lose 100 of the time even if they had a build order win This discourages new players because of the massive skill gap between themselves and the top players I personally see it as a reason to get better and makes me play more but I know I am not the norm Every single person I know that games says the same thing I like SC but it is just too hard
Not true I have played full length games with GM players and even with people like Neuro and Some KR when I was in a decent clan I have taken games off of them They are mortal they DO bleed
If you actually think csgo is a casual game then you have never played it The game is wonderfully designed because the concepts are simple to understand but have huge amounts of depth attached to them thats not obvious to viewers new players
The most important thing is that csgo doesn t let you know that you are bad at the game SC2 just screams that you are terrible after the first 30 seconds of the game and vast majority of people are put off by this And even then it kinda is easier the mechanics are almost non existent in csgo whereas in SC2 you must play for 2 years just to learn to constantly build workers not to mention all the others things Not many people enjoy this sort of thing
There s a reason why there are barely any new pros in CS GO all of them have played for like a decade now There is a decent amount of mechanical skill involved Did it really take you 2 years to learn to constantly build workers
games like csgo and hearthstone has massive casual appeal because precisely of that they re simple games at their cores but difficult to truly master does a noob really need to know where to smoke or anything like that in a casual match in csgo to go in and spray an ak whereas in sc2 the multitasking aspect alone throws a lot of people off and overwhelms new players it s not a very simple game because there is just so much to manage on your own you often can t just jump in blind and expect to pull off wins whereas there s some instant gratification aspects to csgo in the forms of kills even if you do end up with a shitty K D ratio
csgo is super cheap on steam right now fun game you might wanna play it a bit before you act like you had an idea of what you are talking
I ve played both games extensively and the learning curve is much smoother You just play the game and naturally improve In sc2 you have to be invested in improving you can t just blindly go in and start winning games Csgo also allows you to have small victories ie getting a kill sc2 there are no small victories
I don t think it is easy to be really good at it I think you can have more fun with your friends playing cs go on a public server than playing ladder on sc2
I totally agree Being bad at starcraft is super unfun while in cs even if you are bad you can play with friends and do dumb stuff and the game can still be fun
The game is not casual as far as fps goes but fps is inherently more casual than rts There is a smooth natural learning curve The actions are intuitively learned I m sc2 you must commit to improving before the game gets fun similar to say learning to play am instrument
At the high level CSGO isn t casual well it s the most casual counter strike but still not really casual At the lower levels CSGO is really casual compared to sc2 at low levels A silver playing competitive is going to have a better time i e find it more fun improving than a bronzie in sc2 You can find a mentor pretty easily if you want to there are other people to rely on other people to blame etc Team games are a lot more accesible to casuals than 1v1 games which is why they are often called casual no matter how much depth they have which is why they are more popular in general I can t think of a game with a real pro scene that s casual at the high level Kartrider doesn t count I ve played CS for a very long time same with starcraft I reckon it s a lot more casual than sc2
Yea like many others it happened during work maybe if you did it on weekend Also i realize the whole world cant be american but thanksgiving is a pretty heavily family oriented holiday for most americans
I think its also partly because not a lot of people watch SC2 exclusively now I think there is a lot of cross game audience and if another more popular game is having a major tournament alongside SC2 the viewership really mirrors it TL DR Scheduling
I mainly stopped watching due to the LONG down times There was not even a timer to know when the next match was
i m going to watch some of it today if that makes anybody feel better
Thanksgiving and the rest in the US will hurt viewership Timing again for NA will hurt viewership Friday play days are known to have smaller viewerships because lots of people have 9 to 5 jobs and can t just watch an orgy of SC2 I expect it to be far better today
Maybe they shouldnt have released same time as fallout4
DH was at like 5am And broadcasted during the holiday Even people who get up that early to watch GSL probably weren t able to watch It was just bad scheduling
I wanted to watch it I was just busy I ll probably watch the VODs at some point
overpowered adepts I bet he loves this game
This is what happends when you kick Robert Ohl n GJ Dreamhack
I hope Blizzard and tournament organizers have something planned for the next year because the LotV release doesn t seem to have had as much hype behind it as Heart of the Swarm did Remember the 24 hour release stream with Day9 Husky and the first HotS IEM that easily went over 100k They might have actually focused too much on the hardcore community us but it is hard to draw any definite conclusions right now We can kind of blame it on the poor scheduling this time but if the next tournament doesn t go better we might have to ask ourselves a few painful questions
It was just a truly unintelligent time to release Idk what they were thinking Going against Fallout Battlefront Assassin s Creed and Tomb Raider
Its all because they invited HuK instead of MorroW morDuck
would help if someone actually advertised it SC2 is the only e sport I follow and I had no idea it was going on Another problem nothing is standard I have no idea how this stuff translates to other tournaments or if it s even connected or whatever
This franchise is still losing players after a new release They had a chance to keep the franchise going way back in WOL but chose to alienate most everybody David Kim is the Jerry Jones of e Sports
There s a couple of things going wrong First having almost all of the tournament take place in the middle of the day on two working days it s pointless Weekdays are only appropriate for qualifiers the guts of any tournament has to take place between Friday and Sunday evening or how on Earth could you expect to attract any viewers especially with StarCraft s statistically older audience The other mistake they made was with the Korean invites They had a great opportunity to brand the tournament as a foreigner competition which at the very least would have turned some heads Instead we re having to suffer mismatches involving players like Solar who nobody outside the StarCraft bubble gives two shits about vying for a championship that is no longer memorable They crapped all over their own brand for the sake of the basement dwellers who insist on telling the lie that Koreans are essential to tournament quality This isn t a fair reflection of the StarCraft scene it s a Dreamhack FUBAR Or perhaps more likely they re being paid by Blizzard to run the tournament and don t give a fuck about driving the viewer numbers
if no one outside starcraft gives a shit about solar then i promise you the random foreigner talent wouldnt fare better
Unfortunately WCS Season 3 proved this point to be 100 misguided Casual fans tune in to see foreigners in late tournament rounds they don t tune in to see Patience or Solar The numbers don t lie
Keep fighting the good fight The foreign SC2 scene was built with Koreans in mind now that people making decisions have been friends with them for so long they can t weed out the rampant cronyism so the idiotic Korean worshipping continues I m sad Blizzard or even these weekend events can t give us one major premier tournament league without some Koreans in them Korean fanbase is downsizing while the foreigner fanbase isn t given room to have a fair chance at growth A sad state of affairs that isn t Dreamhack s fault alone but somebody has to start driving this game into the other direction If Blizzard shits the bed with WCS and allows Koreans into PL this game is done as an eSport
I have played StarCraft since 2004 I recently uninstalled the game about 4 days ago I m not coming back this game has way too many gimicks It s sad to see all the bullshit units and abilities on all three sides that are terrible RTS design So frustrating to see the game in this state I had so much passion
needs more good players line up as a non european i have no desire to watch games between mediocre europeans
It s freaking Thanksgiving weekend Come on
It s only Thanksgiving weekend in the US Rest of the world don t care not even Canada especially not Europe where the event is held
But the US is a big source of viewership for Twitch
Good point it d be interesting to see what the US viewer numbers are typically
doesnt matter that its a different game if nobody gives a fuck
korean masterrace i don t care about all these european shitters If there were gods at the dreamhack the viewership might be higher instead we get people like Huk who loses to Destiny on ladderi mean I wasn t planning on making colossus before I learned about this so nothing has really changed
Try flying your pheonixes next to it
It s hard to build colossi when you re terran
Well to para bomb a colossus first you first would need to face a colossus
wich is a good thing imo I suck vs disruptors but it s actually a fun interaction and i love to watch them on stream even more I just wish maps were a little more open so people had more place to micro and spread
I m glad colossi aren t the go to unit in every matchup but I d like to see them sometimes I feel like it should be possible to get them to a point where they re situational just like the HTs or void rays
HTs are not situational If you have the means they are always worth it Except maybe in pvp
what about if your opponent doesn t build any units CHECKMATE
Then merge to Archons
I hear ya I m no good at this splitting stuff but man is it fun and even better to watch Can t wait to see who emerges as the Zerg Foxer MKP and shows us real zerg splitting for the first time
I was about to write this Damn I miss my good ol A move Colossi
WoL and HotS ladder is still there m8
As a zerg player I honestly miss colossi Disrupters are cool and all but there is nothing like facing down a massive war of the worlds deathball I hope they buff colossi to their former glory so toss has a meaningful choice between them and disrupters
I can see them being mixed in the army comp in PvT but I doubt they will ever be used in PvZ tbh outside diamond ladder games where I still see them P
Even top level Protoss pros like Myungsik mix in some Colossus into their comp in PvZ They usually get 2 3 after a handful of disruptors to help get that consistent damage in while the Disruptors are not shooting
Thanks I haven t watched much outside of Dreamhack I guess I was wrong I could see them being used in hold position while activating disruptors to kill lurkers to hold the ravager hydra ling back now that I think about it By the way where did you get to watch Myungsik and other top Korean Protosses play Leifang Cup Olimoleague etc Just curious since I haven t come across any top level Protoss Korean play yet
With Myungsik I just watch his stream Same with seeing other toss players playing vs Zergs you can either watch their streams or the stream of a Zerg player to see what Protoss is doing to them The Colossus is mostly strong because your goal is to siege the Zerg from the midgame onwards to prevent them from sieging you with Lurkers because at that point it s GG The colossus help with the siege for the same reason you mention Hold position doing constant damage while Disruptors are on cool down and force the Zerg to engage unfavorably
Ok thank you for the answer I can t wait to see how top Koreans play LotV I ll try to keep up with streams more
there is nothing like facing down a massive war of the worlds deathball Are you being serious
More or less I miss how easy colossi were to counter P
Maybe you should share the secret with the pros you know since literally no one at any level of play thought they were easy to counter
That s not true at least if you were talking about HotS PvZ Vipers made colossi obsolete to the point that no one even made them anymore For the last 5 months or so it s been blink stalker sentry immortal
what No one made colossi at the end of hots vs zerg
Corrupters Vikings
You just died to blink Stalkers
Well you have to have a ground army yourself as well and proper positioning Okay maybe it wasn t trivial to counter but it wasn t too hard
Considering colossi were the core damage unit in basically every protoss composition maybe you should rethink that they were easy to counter The fact that they die 1v1 to Vikings doesn t have much relevance to their use in a real game
Lol seems like I pissed everyone off by saying colossi were easy to counter I ll just say I was trolling and slink off into the shadows
90 damage for that much energy is probably not worth it anyway rather abduct
They clump of so hard though
the lost in DPS from trying to split them may make it worth it
That s another nail in the Colossi coffin
Which coffin Colossi are already cremated
not really the damage is not that great for a high hp unit like a colossus
Yeah it would be far more effective to use blinding cloud on it Its great effectiveness in HOTS was to dual a lot of damage from decent range Without the range the thing is easy to take down
5 month ago i learned Its not worth it
Wait Isn t this the plot for war of the words
well they are technically air units
They benifit from ground unit upgrades though no I guess that would make them both
where can this map be found for some reason I cant find a working unit tester in the arcade
look up LOTV Unit Tester Online The description should say modified by Brandon WoL version by Killer and modified by Hunter Bookmark it and you have it saved for micro and comps if you cant find it ill invite you to a game where u can bookmark it
Great I found it Thank you sir
Does it kill them
colossus is still underrated prtosses will eventually realise if u make colossus u dont have to face 24 liberation zones overlapping and destroying ur entire army in 2 seconds
Now imagine if you could para bomb Disruptors
This is such a joke I always criticized that colossy are meant to be countered by AA only units like Vikings or corruptors even though they are ground units And before anyone says it dont come up with the usual they are sooo huge argument It should apply to ultras and Thors as well then
No They are huge https i imgur com Zb1KE jpg Lore wise SCVs are almost the size of a thor too Just kidding Colossi are still really big though edit Original thread here https www reddit com r starcraft comments tnqr7 still working on it here are over 40 ground units Thanks u xiaorobear
SCVs the size of a Thor What
deleted
Hey thanks for referencing me Here are the official sizes from the StarCraft Field Manual for the marine SCV thor and colossus compared In that old thread I argued for a smaller thor but that was also way back in the WoL days before I knew how big some of the other units really were The ones I just linked are the Blizzard approved ones from the book so SCVs are really much smaller than thors
So you dislike it purely for aesthetic reasons
I dislike the cicle of counters that it creates since you go for a ground splash dmg dealer are countered by anti air units and that at the same time auto counters a possible air transition which doesnt make sense at all in a strategy game Its alsowhy the reaver was always a better designed units Would there be the same counter mechanic behind the reaver in brood war we would have never EVER seen the carrier transitions back thenIs this physical and US only I can t see it on the page
Code not working at the time of this post I m in the US
I literally bought LotV for full price yesterday Sigh
Buying anything electronic before Black Friday is generally a bad financial decision
Cyber Monday
That s after Black Friday
Could put in a ticket see if Blizzard will give you some battlenet store credit or something
It s NewEgg that made the discount so I doubt Blizzard has anything to do with it
this doesn t seem to work
What do you mean
The site is dead
Thank you based black friday I was hoping you would pull through
What
Thank you based black friday I was hoping you would pull through
I m having a hard time parsing out the meaning of that sentence
There should be a period in the middle and the idioms and Reddit memes make it difficult to read The sentence says in its most basic form Thank you Black Friday treated as a person or deity I was hoping the Black Friday sales would be good worthwhile Black Friday is personified throughout the passage
lol instant gaming got lotv for 24 euro
The Newegg copy is sold out The third party vendor does not accept newegg promo codes
g2a com has it on sale for 28 11 USD Key only though not physical
Thanks for the share Just wanted to double check and ask if this works for US Canadian Looks like an EU site Once you purchase do they just send you the Key
Works for U S They re EU keys but sc2 isn t region locked anymore so it doesn t matter Just got mine yesterday am US was a key from like spain i think also if you google you can find an extra 5 off code like the ones on stream but the basetrade ones etc were only 3
I believe they just give you the key I know the site works for US because I have friends here in the US that have used it successfully and I found out about it from LagTV who are Canadians so I would assume it works for Canada as well If the deal is region specific they make it visible and it says the region in the offer If you look under Language Available the region shows Global
You da real MVP
Happy to help
Damn 40 in Canadian dollar I think i ll wait some more
Oh whoops guess I should ve put a currency in there Sorry friend
Ah don t worry I was just hoping for a better rebate for Canada 40 CAD is pretty much 30 USD so it s fair I guess I m just having a hard time justifying these kind of expenses right now P
Oh I feel you there I m torn between buying this or my cosplay costume and I think I m going to go with the costume as much as it pains me I ll probably end up asking for the game for Christmas
Probably as good as it s going to be for a long time At least it s the same as HoTS when it came out
g2a applies EU VAT and ups the price by a lot depending on where you live 6 7 euros more CJS CDKeys is where it s cheapest for european users From my experience they re trustworthy I got all my keys bought BF3 Premium DS1 2 Battlefront Lotv although do not take my word for it use cd key sites at your own risk
You can also use their promo codes for another 3 5 Most are 3 i found one on google ZEDER that was 5
Thanks for the tip I just got myself a copy Kinda wish it was 20 or 25 but this is enough for me
Be careful I ve heard of people getting screwed by those grey market key sites a lot of them resell Russian codes that don t work outside Russia
They are a marketplace and some resellers are bound to be fraudulent But they have a good reputation system and reliable buyer protection so it s not too much of a risk The Russisn keys are clearly labeled and are not supposed to work without a VPN
It s legit I know plenty of people that have bought games there and I ve done so myself Life s A Glitch TV is also sponsored by them
doesn t work for mac
They all have codes which you attach to your bnet account Then you can install whichever client So yes it will work for mac
Is it actually a physical copy T T
Code doesn t seem to be working anymore
Got my lotv for 26 euros on instant gaming
Rest in peace deal
You can also just buy it off G2a for 24
For those saying it s not working Cdkeys com has it for 30 as well Picked it up today Digital key
I can recommend gameladen com always buying random stuff there 5 min delivery and cheap Bought 2 copies of LotV for friends and before that Heart of Thorns and before that HotS
Has been under 30eur from the start at cdkeys com now at 23eur
I heard those keys only work in Russia
nope normal key worked for me in the EU
Nope global real keys EU here also
I bought mine from there a few days before LotV release for 27 and had no issues receiving activating it US here Took me 30 seconds to add it to my battle net account and I was good to go
shouldn t matter Even if they re russian keys sc2 is global except china Before they region locked it would matter now it doesn t
deleted
Ahh are they Good catch You can change that in files though right like how people sometimes change in game sounds to korean
Unfortunately not The Russian CIS versions only support Russian as a language I made a ticket to ask this same question and that s what the Blizzard rep told me
Whew Glad i didn t buy the russian version then I probably would ve if it were the cheapest Lucked out the cheapest version was from Spain i think
Nice already 25 off Thanks for nothing blizz
If it was a Blizzard sale it would be at all retailers This is likely something NewEgg did on their ownwhy does it need fixed I was offended by Apollo and Demuslim saying Swarmhost v Swarmhost I thought it was more like a positional TvT only with more constant army movement
In the long term I don t think you will like this MU You can like it now but it s worse than Roach vs Roach
thanks for telling me how I do and should feel I disagree with your opinion It s exciting and it s going to evolve after we re more than a month into LotV
If it is going to evolve i am up for it Right now i really do not see an avenue for this MU to evolve What composition will it evolve to Nothing ground since it will melt to distrupters As for air tempest changed nearly nothing The only thing i see i a possible carrier transition and that is it
Tempests were a big part of why ShowTime won game 1 I think we ll see more drops and counterplay behind the front lines to take advantage of the high APM going on with the main army dance The players who can multitask the best will flourish I also think it s a bit weird to suggest that less than one month into LotV there will be no evolution Let Proleague players get ahold of these units for 4 months
We re seeing PvP evolve right now Tempests I look forward to trying them out on the ladder
Yeah you mean harassment will happen which is not an army evolution Also i have already accepted tempest as an advantage they are just not definite enough to end it fast
In the post you replied to I said it s exciting and it s going to evolve after we re more than a month into LotV I am talking about the match up of PvP That s all encompassing
And i said what is it going to evolve to and gave my reasons for not seeing it come to be Also evolving the composition does not involve having harassment on the side that is not a composition
You re the only one who used the word composition which I tried to gently point out up with my previous point I ll be more blunt now so that you can get it continuously mentioning the word composition is nothing more than arguing against yourself Have fun with that
Composition is what i mean by army evolution What can else can army evolution be upgrades If you wanted clarification in that you should have just said it with the first post If you mean sprinkling some harassment as evolution that is certainly not in my definition
Hopefully
Its like roach vs roach if banelings could rocket forward at ling speed and kill all your roaches instantly Your view of the MU is so wrong it makes me think youve only watched one game of pvp Evenif you think its already stale what is your suggestion Im curious what you think will be better than what pvp already has to offer
Only nonzergs think Roach v Roach is boring It doesn t matter if it s boring to watching if you understand starcraft and if you can appreciate it s a skill matchup you should be able to appreciate it
As a zerg i think roach vs roach was boring
As a terran i thought Roach vs Roach was interesting to Watch
Commentators play a big role in the excitement level of RvR If you get Rotti and Nate it s going to be a tad more boring than if you have Pig or Snute and Apollo
I would agree with that
It was the same thing with PvPs IMO If you get ToD Rotti and or Incontrol it brings a different level of excitement to it ZvZ and PvP have a lot of nuanced plays that only certain people can point out It makes sense that those people can highlight the nuances and make the matchups more exciting
So we have determined race had no effect on enjoying roach vs roach
Increase Disruptor supply or slow them down
Why we should fix this you prefer colossus battle
I certainly do
Retarded shitpost thread PvP is actually enjoyable to watch now as someone that s loathed PvP games since WoL
It s fun to watch I agree but do you really want PvP to look like this for the rest of PvP life
There is no reason to think that PvP will stay like this Showtime even showed in this one game how you can not rely on Disruptors alone
Its the best PvP we ever had
I mean I wouldn t have the APM to do that and I wasn t complaining about HotS PvP too but I must say that this new PvP is still fun to watch
Do you really think Collosy vs Collosy was better lol Well I guess some protossplayers just want to avoid having to micro Therefore they don t like the matchup anymore
Wanted a game of positioning and a small chess of right moves you got it withthe new PvP Ah wait what most people want is like random drops flying around the map to kill workers and pretend that you are multi tasking
I do agree with you but its too early to make this kind of thread
Maybe disruptors should have very quickly regenerating energy but at a small amount say 50 so that high templar could counter them Basically they would have full energy for every shot and it would completely use the energy every time
You keep saying it s like roach vs roach that s totally wrong Roach vs Roach and muta vs muta is whoever builds the most roaches or mutas wins unless someone does a Firecake and move commands into a concave Disruptor wars are a micro fest that rewards positioning and awareness That s not a problem at all in my mind
I dunno I really love the way PvP is atm I think this is the best meta PvP has ever had during Starcraft 2
Lol what In my experience it s amazing to watch and play
Do you really want PvP like this for 1 2 years This is worse than Roach vs Roach
Personal opinion only is so much better than roach vs roach in my opinion
This is the most micro intensive thing that has ever existed besides taking a great deal of army movement knowledge and now imagine when people get the hang of it better warp prism disruptor flanks more tech switches either into air or into something we don t know yet The matchup looks plays and feels amazing and the future looks even better
It s so hard to play though not a bad thing Look away for one second and your army can be dead and you look back speaking from experience But extremely fast and fun
The secret to not get your army killed without even noticing it is having a good vision map leave a stalker at key places keep them walking around force the enemy so spread stuff the more map control you have the lower or probably non existing chances that you will get your army killed
then you prefer the colossus battle you ve watched 3 or 4 years You want watch colossus battle for 1 2 years instead of disruptor battle
It s 1000000x better than just colossus vs colossus It reminds me of ling bling vs ling bling and I don t see that as a bad thing in the slightest
So you don t like positioning and micro based battles This is probably the best PvP has ever been I do hope it stays like this for a while
Remove 55 Shield Damage It would give the Option to play other Unit Compositions than Blink Disruptor only Just think about it It would still be the favorite Unit Composition but 3 Shots instead of 2 for Archons 3 barrier instead of 2 Barrier for Immortals 2 Shots instead of 1 Shot for Zealots Stalkers Or nerf the Shield Damage so that it doesnt One shot every Gate way unit
This would need some testing cause thinking about it it might make it even worse but raising the cooldown on the Disruptor attacks by a significant amount might work The logic would be that the players would both miss their disruptor attacks and proceed to try a normal attack while both of them have no disruptors ready Problem is this might make disruptor useless in other situations
Yeah i agree it was really a lot on the side of snowballing and now it is on the exact opposite side Yeah sure this game was fun but imagine every lategame PvP being like that and not evolving it will get really really boring really fast It needs something for the game to evolve or have more interactions in the army battle Right now it is blink and distrupter hits that determines everything in the army fight it really needs moreWinning is only half the battle Lilbow is practicing the other half
How have I never heard this joke made before
Cabbage
Baguette
I m going to use that line
I see that he has adapted well from HotS s stalkers to LotV stalkers
DId TLO beat lilbow
yes 2 1
I m confused why he always went for Blink Stalker All ins Like he was practicing so hard and doesn t have any builds now
He has tons of them though he s got the old sturdy blink stalker then he has one with 1 then he has one with 1 and observer then he has one with 1 observer and a warp prism then he has one with 2 observer and warp prism And when things get real dicey he pulls out his 3 variation He also has a trusty 2 base one and sometimes a 3 base one and sometimes he doesn t put probe on the 3rd like to mind game you and then when he decides to get really crazy he adds in a few immortals on top But I can see why to mere mortal eyes it might look like he s just doing the same thing
Up tlo d for your creatifity
Well it has been working for the past 5 years in every matchup lol
Maybe he was busy practicing mass adept warppism allins against terran
he s practising for warcraft 4 mate read the title
I think he was just playing along with the meta I see a lot of other protoss doing the same pvz is pretty weird atm
Guys wtf hes clearly practising for Hearthstone 2
but it doesn t have Stalkers
It doesn t have 2base blink stalker all ins every game
Love the spoiler tag
Well it kinda does imply that Lilbow is out which is a spoiler Doesn t take a genius to put two and two together
this is reddit I wouldn t make any assumptions based on intelligence
I am also very smart and you guys are all stupid
I think he means that the spoiler tag doesn t do its job since it comes at the end of the spoiler itself It basically says Lilbow lost btw spoiler
Spoiler tag does it s job in that you can filter out everything tagged spoilers using the subreddit filter If you use the no spoiler filter you won t see this thread because it s been appropriately tagged
Fair enough but most of those posts are congratulations to the winner of vs and you have to actually open the post to have anything spoiled
Yh I accept that the spoiler tag doesn t do anything if you re not using the filter I just wanted to make the point that is useful in one regard
To be honest lilbow is so uncreative If you would give his build orders for the 3 games to an protoss master player it would have been the same I think he has the potential to be so much better but he has to start being more unpredictable because right now you dont really have to scout him to know whats up
All jokes aside his PvZ in WCS was so awesome to watch The comeback against Hydra and his match against Zanster were incredible Personally I hope he makes a comeback
incredible like the games vs life yea
DAE think Lilbow sucks even if he was the number 1 foreigner in 2015 according to WCS GUYS
i think people being a bit unfairly harsh You can practice a lot and still lose a game I practice all the time and am still terrible D
I think that s exactly part of the critique
Practicing is fantastic People aren t actually bothered about that It s the dumb mentality at Blizzcon to not prepare for it I don t think anyone really believes his excuse It feels more like he didn t bother trying and gave the I m practicing for LotV instead as an excuse to keep things positive tl dr he should have tried at Blizzcon That s what people are really bothered by
Lilbow ended up with 3 2 7 5 how is that bad Thats the best foreign non zerg score in a really hard group he did beat TY and Nerchio even thats pretty fucking impressive Meanwhile Bunny went 0 5 2 10 this thread
Well the joke is that he blew off HotS final tournament to be rdy for LotV so he should be better than the others But now he is out lol
Well none of the other foreigners practised for blizzcon either so he should be even
Well TLO for one was definitely still very occupied with HotS before and during Blizzcon and he booted Lilbow quite handily
If you mean commentating that doesn t really stop you from practising legacy Also he plays zerg so the win doesn t count
If you want your commenting to be on point you still have to keep your head well in the game without that much room to really start properly getting into LotV and the commentators at Blizzcon all were really on the ball And I think the fact that Puck is currently 2 0 vs TLO debunks your balance whine quite nicely too
Well you don t really forget hots by playing legacy for a few months And even TLO said in the interview that zerg is favored in zvp That being said I m surprised how well proross have done in this tourney Edit PvZ going 9 0 today so far I guess TLO was wrong
No lol He blew blizzcon because he would anyway He had no chances and i he wasted a few months of practice for hots he would be BEHIND everyone that has been playing lotv Get your logic straight lol
Well in Blizzcon 2013 NaNiwa was put against Soulkey one of the favorites to win it upset hardcore by bomber but he practiced and fought and even took a map off Soulkey and didnt completely crumble in the other games Thats how youre supposed to do it not just give up especially when you 1 month prior had said you would win Blizzcon Lilbow is being made fun off because of his attitude towards it by just giving up without a fight
In fact Soulkey himself stated that playing against him was like playing against another Korean so yeah It was 3 1 but it was a high quality 3 1
It is how you win fans and influence people
toxic or not I really respected naniwa back then the tie breaker against revival I think was also a stomp from naniwa but to be fair there was no new expansion coming out
Well he would ve had to put a LOT of effort into practice if he wanted to play seriously and it probably wouldn t have been worth it even if he beat Life But him beating Life was basically impossible to begin with so a lot of effort wasted for literally nothing except less people cry on reddit smart decision by him
Lol so funny playing without soundproofing Fuck off with your knightly shit He made the responsible decision and you re just a circlejerkwave immature wanker
No it s not This is exactly the same thing Stupidity in PR
Regarding of whether he had no chance or not that s not the mindset of a pro gamer For me and you oh hell of course man if either of us had to go up against Life and then Innovation yes we could say to each other it s no use But for a person who does nothing but spend his entire time just practicing and being a pro gamer then gaming is his life For perspective the 8 hours that I spend at the office as a cubicle warrior Lilbow is spending that very same time playing the game bringing him to untold heights that I can never dream of That s the difference between someone who is a professional vs someone who only plays as a hobby That s where all the outage came from especially from ppl who were his fans and believed in him He represented the foreign hope at Blizzcon even if he didn t want to be like that position and just threw it away But don t take my word for it Take a look at his facebook page and all the people who ve said it far better than I can here
IMO Lilbow s only mistake was that he said loud what he just should have done in quiet Millenium has no pro Zerg with which Lilbow could have practiced You can t put up a random top 50 EU gm and expect it to be practise for Life All the good Zerg which could have given him practice on the ladder were already playing LotV The match vs Life was already a lost cause His matches vs Life weren t even that bad The early pool was a buildorder Loss because Lilbow always puts down the Pylon on the lowground on that map Life s cheese in the last game was well held and Lilbow misjudged in the later stages of the game If you watched Life vs Classic the games looked very similar Life also going for 13 12 aside from a 7 Pool on the same map that he did vs Lilbow
I m just going off of some of things I saw ppl post on Facebook so take that for what it s worth There was some talk on how there was an opportunity for him to practice in Korea which he didn t take up There was some mention of ppl on Twitter who offered to be his practice partner leading up to Blizzcon We don t know what became of those offers but it appears as if those were turned down as well There are ppl from both sides of the equation eg CatZ who agreed with Lilbow s rationale for not bothering with practice for Blizzcon because what s the use when LotV was just around the corner Then there are the angry ex fans who wanted to see their champion give it his all because he s a pro gamer and presumably the pro gamer attitude Perhaps you are correct that the only thing Lilbow needed was a PR type person to vet his thoughts through And this is the reason why so many Koreans when interviewed all seem to say all the same things such as I will try to show my fans exciting games I will train harder etc etc If Lilbow followed that template then well that could have solved everything
lilbow doesnt owe us anything though
What are you talking about A progamer would not be pro if he didn t have any fans
i thought the definition of pro was making money playing the game
So how do you think they make money By playing in tournament paid by fans
I haven t paid anything so far
Then you must be really special if you never seen a ad on a tournament or donated money to a player
No one owes anyone anything no matter who you are We live we die and that s life
Yep Let s practice the old game for a month or two so I fall behind everyone playing lotv Please stop Do you even live in the real world The only mistake he made was admiting to it publically The decision was 100 right
Yes because relying on some intangible potential advantage over those that haven t had the time to practice yet is clearly more important than the biggest starcraft tournament in the world
Practice with whom though Millenium has no Zerg in their team and everybody else did already play lotv
TLO himself said that both he and a several others including some Koreans I believe have offered but Lilbow declined
Don t look at me Tell the people on his Facebook page who are publicly bashing him and saying extremely harsh words I would never do such a thing
what fucking months wcs final were on September 13 which he clearly prepared for and the blizzcon tournament ran from november 1st to 7 Oh he clearly would ruin his progaming life if he spent one and half month preparing for the biggest sc tournament you can get to insted of practicing in constantly changing beta of the next game well now we see that he probably should invest more time and actually try to fight at blizzcon because i beleave that he could show good games and show foreigners in good light but well let it be now
The fact that you are getting upvoted really show how biased retarded this subreddit can be
His comment is just calling the race bias bullshit because comment he replies to implied that being zerg somehow favors people in this tournament
It is looking like zerg is slightly stronger than Terran and toss now but this is nowhere near BL infestor or warhound tier broken Lilbow may not be taking any GSLs anytime soon and he may have fucked up royally last month but he did decently well
Thats like back in 2012 man
beating nerchio impressive lol
nerchio has been lights out in lotv probably the best player that can knock out solar or parting in the tournament
Ya if u think he has a chance against solar I don t know what to tell you
idk man i dont like Nerchio but Zerg is strong and Nerchio has proven me wrong before
Ya zerg is strong but solar is zerg too
Shh don t tell him
You can always turn ZvZ into a micro contest which Solar will probably win
lol
firecake is so much underrated
He meant best non zerg foreigner in group C
deleted
So you re saying Lilbow was practicing to NOT BE LEFT BEHIND mind blown
none of you are mad about this you just want more mean spirited bullshit to circlejerk about
Instead of giving a good response I m gonna start practicing for the next one
rofl
wow hahahah
PRECISELY
yup
What did you think this wasn t reddit Get with the program and let the hate flow through you
Did anyone notice how life was able to beat top KR tosses with a similar aggressive style Lilbow doesn t deserve this shit his games vs ty and nerchiomwere fine
Didn t see Nerchio but TY would have gone quite differently if TY had actually walled off properly It feels like Lilbow only has one single build for each matchup and all of them are based around not letting the game go beyond 8 minutes It kind of felt like he was afraid to get pulled into a Macro game
This criticism is legit the shit posting is what gets me going
This is reddit The day people stop shitposting is the day the site folds
I ve not been paying much attention but didn t Lilbow just win around 5000 last weekend
He basically rolled over and died at Blizzcon justifying it by saying he had been practicing LotV instead of HotS before the tournament That s the basis of the joke
We ve heard that joke by now you know
And its just getting better I think we can throw it around for a couple of months more without any problem
Did I claim it was some new joke that nobody had told yet
I think all of this is a bit unfair Lilbow didnt practice Hots for blizzcon because he didnt want to fall behind other players in LOTV not to be the best that there is besides you gotta remember that this is his job he did what he thought was the best for his career I m not saying that i would ve done the same but who knows there might be some factors we are not familiar with
Blows off arguably the biggest tournament ever in HoTS to be middle of the pack in LoTV
We know that any foreigner would probably have lost in the first round anyway
Topkek
hahahaaha don t care about blizzcon literally the best tournament ever gonna train for a small time eu tourney in advance i got this guys hahahaahhaha holy shit this is embarrassing
Correct I misread the bracket Hence he should have shown off Thanks for pointing this out to me and sorry about it
more like shitbow
lolbow i guess
fucking rekt
Good one
We should add a related subreddit r lilbow to support all the community recent shitposting r starcraft will be overloaded soon
Warcraft 4 what is this
Lilbow beat TY who has been practicing a legit progamer schedule since the age of 12 This thread is a little disgusting
he also lost Tlo https twitter com EGiNcontroL status 669988479401521152
Who is a respectable player
https twitter com LilbowSC status 661013516518715393 Not by Lilbow
I m lost guys when Nerchio wins it s because he plays zerg when TLO wins it s because he is the best Can someone explain how it works
Yes Let s all talk shit about Lilbow for being competitive in a LotV tournament I mean I practiced for a few weeks and I m pretty sure I could win a GSL EZ Can t even beat a bum like TLO what a joke kappa
Give TLO a bit more credit than that please he deserves it
Lilbow turned down offers for blizzcon practice from TLO because he didn t think he was good enough
If that s true then we ve reached a whole other level of hilarity And karma
Yep it s magical He claimed he couldn t get any good European practice partners for Blizzcon so he chose to practice Legacy instead TLO came out and said he others offered to practice with him and he said it wouldn t have been worth it I still think Lilbow is a good player but it s amusing to bask in this result just because of the sort of hole he dug himself
You don t piss off TLO
Source I tried Googling but nothing came up
TLO said it during a WCS intermission
Ah OK Must have missed it
I think this is your own interpretation
TLO was not good enough at the end of HOTS He is a player that is very good at innovating so he is at its best when shit is upside down and nobody know what they are doing Lotv current state Anyway why I try to be reasonable and rational in a thread like this Ur dur lilbuw fail wat a dumb froggy is more appropriated
If nobody knows what they are doing then why take 2 months off Hots to practice Protoss LotV Where is the benefit Mad strawman though It s fair enough for people to be disappointed that the only Foreigner to make it to Blizzcon throws in the towel because it s to hard
Considering Lilbow is playing protoss it s not bad of a result PvZ is very imbalanced favoring zerg
BabyRage Imbalanced because I can t mass Stalker anymore BabyRage
It s really hard to take someone seriously when they spam twitch emotes
With Twitch being the main streaming platform for games the faces should be already etablished in the scene
thats a fucking fact mate if you think PvZ is balanced on this map ur a dreamer

You autistic faggots do realise that lilbow had to practice to not FALL BEHIND others Anyone hating on him is an autistic cunt lol the guy is awful prwise but he made the right decision so fuck off
Pretty funny how this guy figured out how to abuse the mothership core and sentries and he was praised as an incredible player Guess that s just Protoss for you though
Unlike zergs and terrans who dont use their units because that would be ungentlemanly A medivac drop spits out tea
It is better time investment than playing lotv if zerg doesn t get nerfed
Cry more Lilbow only played one style and didnt change shit so Creative for someone who didn practice for Blizzcon because of LotV
I don t care I wanted lilbow to win No one gives a shit about TLO because if you remember everytime he made it into quarterfinals of WCS he got slapped
but but UP TLO
Lilbow wins lol he is just a trash blink stalker abuser Lilbow loses lol he was our foreign hope fuck him
This joke got old the first 500 times Nice originality bruh
Lol nice baquette burn man
He was already qualified when he was playing against TLO Why should he show off and reveal strategies he could use on more important matches Aside this hearing TLO s interview explaining he has destabilized Lilbow beforehand was funny Let s see what happens this week end before talikng too much
He was qualified for what Maybe have another look at the bracket then you will realise something
Lilbow is out They were fighting for the final spot Or in Lilbow s case to finish 1st or get eliminated To go deeper for him it was automatic seeding in top 6 and therefore guarenteed pricemoney or nothing So I d say he had a couple or reasons to show off
Correct I misread the bracket Hence he should have shown off Thanks for pointing this out to me and sorry about itI m sorry that happened but if there s one thing I ve learned in life it s that assholes are everywhere especially on the internet Don t let it get to you and enjoy the game whatever way you please
Thanks I m used to much worse flaming from Dota so I wasn t bothered by it Just found it funny that that was the first reaction I got from chat when I said I was new
Think about it doesn t meter how awful you are You will not ruin 4 other people game
That s the best thing about sc2 No people to carry well in coop at times
Matter
I knew that something was wrong thank you It s hard to know if I m improving or not in english Nowadays people only point mistakes in 1 3 of my comments so it is something D
No problem Meter is either the length unit or like those thingies you put money on at parking lots
parking lot
Don t get discouraged The SC II Community is overall very helpful and kind If you have any questions about the game feel free to ask me
In case you didn t get a proper response I think you should jump to ladder already You are gonna get crushed the first few games and get placed in bronze but in time the game will find opponents of your skill level Playing against other players is way more fun than vs ai
Just be prepared to lose half your games forever It s the same for your opponents Focus on improving yourself and having fun
General Chat is a cold and desolate place mostly You can find helpful people in general chat usually you won t
General chat is almost as cancerous as twitch chat
only the U S one
It is in this enlightened state of m EU chat that I find euphoria
EU is just as bad edit butthurt downvotes won t change reality as always
EU general chat always breaks out into a race war I think we are all still bitter about WW2
nope
thx for the constructive discussion
dude I COME from EU and there s plenty of toxic behaviour in general chat especially the german one Ye 2 guys downvoting not agreeing liking what they read clearly implies I am shit talking compared to the vast majority of people not actually upvoting stuff at all good logic
dude I just visited the german chat and they are talking about you being an idiot D especially the german sc2 chat is maybe one of the best places of any open chats on the fucking internet no shit If you don t blend in maybe it s because of you
nice sample size you have there D maybe after being so busy admiring how well you blend in with the hivemind you realize you and I obviously have very different standards when it comes to chat being cancerous
EU has some guy named Fate who sits there and tells campaign spoilers
removed
Well done

Being a psychopath is a result of missing brain activity
Being butthurt is a result of a overly sensitive butt
Hey buddy shoot me a pm with your battle tag and number and I ll give you some coaching and training for free
Welcome to the internet
I ve been playing this game for 3 years and I am so far good its not even funny don t worry about that stuff just try to improve and enjoy the game some people are assholes most flame when they lose me included but I always point new players in the right direction I would suggest watching day9 daily 252 on hotkeys https www youtube com watch v RUohpQKVf A
Today i played my first LotV 2vsAI and i got paired with someone that just finished the WoL campaign and said that it s his first multiplayer game I told gim to take time and he did pretty good i had to remind him to build a tech lab not only reactors so he can research stim and combat shields After the game i added him to my friendlist and we played 3 or 4 more vs AI games one were we proxy raxxed the harder AI after that we did one co op game then he had to go He s now online and doing the zerg campaign
This makes me a little sad as Starcraft 1 Battle net was my first ever online experience I distinctly remember how the community was very friendly and how some pubs didn t rage when I cost them a 4v4 game because it was my first game online EVER and I was mostly taken aback by chatting with other people The chat lobby was actually full of people who were also probably quite new ish to the internet and a little bit in awe of the whole situation I hope we come full circle at some point
Ok as someone that also spent a lot of time on B net growing up I don t think it was that much better There were more people talking but I think that is because this was a time before Facebook Reddit or even MySpace basically there were not as many places to go and socialize online So if you re dropped into a chat with 30 other people it was a bigger deal But there was a ton of shit talk trolls and crude stuff just as now I remember hoping my mom wouldn t look over at the screen when I was in lobby because I was worried she d want me to stop playing if she read the shit people said I usually just joined into an empty room to avoid that
As with any multiplayer game lol dota hon csgo cod etc or online chat forum xda 4chan etc expect anonymous chats to be shit And play with your friends for a far better experience
Oh man what a bad experience Sorry about that You ll see a bit of that on there but don t let it get to you To answer your question its totally up to The game is very different when you play against someone as you would not with DOTA so I would recommend playing unranked if you feel ranked is too pressured You ll most likely lose a bunch of games until the ranking system matches you up with people in the same skill level Unranked and Ranked have separate ranking so don t stress too much Happy gaming if you have any questions you can PM here
Yeah i also lost a game in a Bronze and the Terran who steamrolled me at the first fight whispered me after the game that i am retard and i should uninstall the game D
Don t worry trolls trying to be edgy pick on easy prey They re shitters I ll bet if you ask anyone for help you ll even get coaching here or in general chat Though anyone familiar with barrens chat should know that the general chat isn t a place for proper convos P
You should stay away from that channel and use whatever community outside of the game beside the official forum most people there are trolls or bad players teaching their bad habits to other bad player
Join my clan Only two of us and we are both sound
I say go for it I m new also and just jumped into ladder once I could beat hard AI Out of 15 games I ve won 1 Pretty brutal but learning a lot trying to figure out my mistakes is pretty tough when you don t know much but slowly but surely If you are EU and want someone to practice against let me know
Wow that guy was an asshole You ll find a few players like that but just do your best to ignore them As for your question I d say you could jump into ladder now if you know the basics of what s going on from playing against AI However try not to be disheartened if you lose on ladder because you ll find it a much different experience than AI I lost my first 14 games before I won one Have fun
We all started the same way do not get discourged Assholes always pop up there and then but they are actually a lot rarer in sc2 than certain other games
Hi u icedrake Come over to r allthingsterran We have lots of build orders guides and constant discussions about the game Welcome to the game
Welcome to the internet and no don t play AI play ranked you will learn faster
So there is literally one guy named MyStyle in this chat screenshot who talks shit and you make a big deal out of it really Don t know which dumbfucks upvote this shit
Typical chat trash talk
must be Americas server
I can t believe everyone here is taking a joke so seriously New players often ask when how if they should play ladder and a lot of people in that channel are very jaded about it There s no real way to answer that question as it comes entirely from a place of personal anxiety If you want to play ladder then play it If you aren t comfortable with losing so much so that it overcomes your interest to play ladder then no one knows what to tell you Otherwise nothing is stopping you from hitting the button and seeing for yourself Do or do not you ll never be ready edit Since you say you come from Dota the nice thing about 1v1 ladder is that no one cares if you suck
Yeah I vs my friend who was a complete newbie to the game I just kept beating no matter what Thing was I was masters at the time in WoL and he was the lowest a bronze can be I tried to humiliate him in many ways as much as possible and the results would always be the same ie I win Frankly now he is too scared to touch the game Never let a noob play the game and let the servers die down Muahahha
This got you so asspained you felt the need to post this here You re too soft for this game You re not gonna enjoy it trust me Go play LoLNot sure but lllllllllllll has a lot of accounts in GM with all 3 races It must be a high level random GM player like winter or something
Glad you re giving 1 GM random the recognition he deserves
yea it s probably winter
Dont u have some twitch chat to shit up
yes FeelsBadMan
OuO
Please don t bully Pacjax
Shhh we shit twitch chats up together
Beep boop
Well he does play a lot so i m not surprised just look at the combined games of all his accounts He must be playing in several computers at the same time or something
Might be the guy from Viva La Dirt League s You re Gonna GG video
I remember playing against that player in my placement games a couple of times Every time they would instantly surrender I thought it was a troll account only a bronze noob
s
wow thanks for adding that I would have had no chance of realizing he was being sarcastic
Is that what the s signifies Sarcasm I had no idea
S
He is ByuN Chinese commentator xiaose mentioned this in his recent broadcast As a tournament organizer xiaose has almost all Korean pro s accounts on his friend list Moreover he is also the manager of ByuN s contemporary team X team so the source should be convincing BTW that 1 terran on KR GM is Maru also revealed by xiaose
Idra believe
pls Ibelieve2016
Ahhh it s lllllllllllll one of my favourite Terran players You should all know him by now
TaeJa had a free weekend
Where is taeja now Army I been out of the loop for awhile
Last I heard he d missed the deadline to join the army he played in the redbull archon tournament and he popped up in some online cups here and there but he basically retired after Blizzcon last year for the sake of his wrists
Sad I miss the days of team taeja He was top Terran in the world easily then Also where is HerO I looked and he seems to barely compete
He plays for MVP in Proleague and he had a show match vs Scarlett the other day that guy really should start streaming again he always used to get a decent audience and it s the off season right now
I saw him streaming a few days ago He was my favourite player back then Hopes that lotv will help revive the scene
drunken boi
dobi too busy sniping old NA pros
Whoops Looks like I ve been caught out
it s david kim
Boxer pray
I m willing to bet any amount of money it s Innovation Provided I wasn t broke
Inno is high masters last i checked Hes using his standard mixed caps moniker Yup hes 90 50 right now Not fairing as hot as the gms like solar and myungsik Damn guys I guess i insulted your god No one even knows if hes a barcode or not Any of the terrans could be The only actual lead we have is a terran in high masters named INnoVation flanked by a handful of other pros like classic sorry and ryung Maybe hes just adjusting
Innovation is easily capable of getting GM He almost certainly plays on multiple accounts his main being in masters doesn t mean much of anything
Read the reply u oligobop wrote he said he thinks it will take Inno a few weeks to get GM
Well winning tournaments is obviously a lot easier than winning on the ladder
He s able to win GSLs and make it to blizzcon as one if the best 16 players overall but I m glad you pointed out he should be able to reach GM a way higher achievement by now
that s what I was implying but thanks for elaborating
Well i guess we either go on your speculative statement that he has multiple accounts AND one with his actual moniker that is very active Or you can believe that he just started playing and is getting used to the new units and will be GM prob in the next couple weeks
I mean State is KR GM Nothing against him but Inno is way way better Also it s common knowledge that most pros play on barcodes a significant amount I have a really hard time believing someone as good a Innovation would struggle to get out of masters even if he hasn t played much LotV
Well to be fair State beat Inno on stream so maybe he isn t that much better at LotV yet
There are quite a few top pros sitting in high masters right now Dont take my word for it just look at the nios kr yourself Im not taking potshots at your boy inno Im just saying it takes time to adjust to new playstyles Innovation is a mechanical beast Lotv added slightly new mechanical playstyle Hes prob getting used to that
140 games doesn t sound like a progamer He s definitely playing on other accounts then
his 90 50 account could be his experimental builds account or something as well
It s maru that s the same account he played in olimo league im pretty sure
Maru is the rank 1 terran http kr battle net sc2 ko profile 1184851 1 llllllllllll
Can confirm He was using a level 123 account while playing Olimoleague
Can also confirm I was his round 1 opponent that he dispatched in 4 minutes checked my match history and the win loss on that account is the same
I m glad that you re still with us
I played against Maru in that Olimoleague that isn t Maru Maru is indeed the 1 Terran with 120 wins 50 losses
We get it you vape
It d be probably more believable if you guys were to compare avarage APM and build timings as indicators and sort of sherlock who it is
What is it that gives Maru an edge in LOTV than HOTS I know it s new and things are crazy with balance But is he using Liberators well
Marineking
I believe
By the way was he on MVP or Prime during his match vs ByuL
It s gotta be the return of taeja
I want to believe
avilo
Oooooophidian where are you
It s the liberator pilot
it can be any progamer korean terran rly xD
Yoda KappaPride
Solar is rank 6 and almost has double the games as this guy with almost the same win thats even more insane
IMMVP
I was going to say could this be Mvp He was playing a shitton of LotV
Mvp
yer rite
I would say it is ByuN INnoVation TY or FanTaSy but I just looked here http aligulac com periods 151 page 1 sort race t nats KR Maru is the first one http www sc2unmasked com server kr page 1
That sc2unmasked site is PURE GOLD
It is Byun
poof
Ya mon
omfg please take all my upvotes for Ali G reference
He should have said It s probably Byun because it probably is
If I had to take a good guess with the way people have been playing lately I would say it s probably Byun I ll check build orders when I can
more importantly MINABOYS the rank 1 gm from lotv beta is back and playing on kr server Its crazy because its a person you would least expect it to be
That s Patience IIRC
Patience was BIGBOY in beya MINABOYS is actually the best player in America
alot of pros have winrates like that especially with new account
Ahh barcode I m a big fan
Any guess Maru innovation
clearly Samsung Bravo
Polt had like 90 something winrate as terran but I can t seem to find him anymore O
It s gotta be either Innovation or Maru They re the only terran players good enough to have that kind of winrate on KR no less
are some pro playing with that lllllllllllll tag to avoid other people recognizing their strategies
Yeah its that dude llllllllll

His record is probably only so good because he had to play a lot of newbs getting to gm due to a new mmr This is a huge problem with the way the ladder is set up You can only really trust points on an established mmr account
maru or flash
Maru and Flash had to play hots up until blizzcon to give their teammates practice partners or just practice for it maru I highly think that whoever this terran is he was playing the beta consistently and doing well during it
well Maru is actually the terran at 1
Maru is rank 1 and Flash is rank 41Relevant college humor video
Mfw I m the scouting marine
Meanwhile Zerglings don t care they re just happy little puppies in a misguided attempt to get attention
Well every Zergling death is just a happy little accident not a mistake
Gotta add a little of that Alizarin Crimson blood all over the place
and that phthalo blue for the dragoon goo
Diary of a Zergling
At least they have a brother sister to go with them From birth til death Or as zerglings say reeee glaglglglglgl
hfhfhfhfhf too
It s the only way I think about it all those valiant warriors of aiur what must they have thought being sent to top left corner forever
top left corner Were you making a C C reference
Loved this hint On another topic was I the only one to be reminded of Collectors from Mass Effect 2 with this loading screen I got a strong Mass Effect 2 3 vibe during the campaign actually EDIT spelling
The first thing I thought off when I saw that cutscene were the collectors Shame we never got to see anymore of him in a cutscene the in game model and all that did a pretty poor job of showing him off
Isn t his in game model just one of the hybrid Either the behemoth or the ravager i think
To me it reeked more of Lovecraftian Horror
I d love to try a mod where your units occasionally desobey you Dropping behind the zerg s mineral lines Doesn t sound like a great idea we will stay at the natural instead k
It s called Archon Mode ahah
I m not quite sure if this kind of immersion works in a game where a few marines can kill a battlecruiser with a crew of 4 7k people on it
what are you talking about 1 man with a mustachio is only flying that bc the portrait dont lie
You mean Chris Metzen
that is awesome
If we want to image it on a realistic scale 1 marine unit is probably really a squad of 100 people or something
How does he die to Zeratul so quickly then
Zeratul is a beast
someone should really make a video dramatization of this using old clips or new animation could be really really funny
someone should really make a video dramatization of this using old clips or new animation could be really really funny
How is this spoiling anything Genuinely curious
Loading screen art possibly
Before entering Diamond rank I didn t think that way too Now one single unit is so damn important like saving that one single drone or micro ing my roaches saving every single one of them so in the future my army is JUST slightly bigger than my opponent or JUST slightly more minerals etc
if you re only diamond there are way more things you should focus on than microing single units
He isn t wrong I ve been dimound in every season I ve played since I got dimound some time during wings and he is definately over exaggerating
i didn t say he was wrong
During wings though The latter has been getting progressively harder since then save for just after an expansion comes out
I said since wings it was during Hots too
What are some things I should also be focusing on
Depends on the stage of game Early game everything matters
Is there anywhere that art can be found as a wallpaper or something
https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3sdzmf spoilers all loading screens
Thanks
I think all the loading screens are in a folder inside the Starcraft2 folder I ve never tried it though
perfect discription of my current skill level Q Q
Oh so this is what it s like to find spoilers in the front page They re not marked there as they are on the sub Life just got a little more dangerous for me
What spoiler
There is a big guyAs a Zerg player who has played Zerg since the beginning of WoL please oh please David Kim nerf Zerf so everyone stops playing this race
No more ZvZ I beg you
nerfzerf
Zerfgate
but the OP is winning because zerg are loosing to him Surely this just proves that Zerg aren t OP only hyped as such
zerg has been the most played race beyond bronze for a long time now though So I think there are also just more zerg players and the fact that zerg always gets the most fun stuff doesnt help
Stats show percentage of Zerg in higher leagues is higher than percentage of Zerg players This time it is for real and statistically significant
Also anyone who thinks several hundred players is a small sample size should kill themselves
Who s saying anything about several hundred players
GM masters is at least several hundred players Any time anyone mentions a massive difference in the frequency of races at a high level some moron jumps in and parrots small sample size which it s not
Any time anyone on Reddit mentions any sort of statistical anything the most up voted comment is either correlation causation or sample size is too small Even for peer reviewed studies
Oh I would guess it s at least a few thousand if we re counting the whole world So definitely a decent sample size there
Depends on the situation and the environment A few hundred soccer players from the UK is a terrible representation with house league alone having anywhere between 2000 to 3000 players in a some regions Just a small nit pick But for GM league s and masters which only has the top 200 players per region it is a decent sample size for the competition D Have a good day
10 10
I don t actually deserve to be Diamond but the only matchup I m good at happens to be over 50 of my games P
Good for you really Seems like Zerg is the current overpowred race so if they re your best match ups you re in great shape until the next need patches
Won t he be in an even better position win wise next patch if zerg is nerfed or terran and protoss are buffed He s already tanking every non zerg game anyways so things can only get better
No He s losing 0 to 5 against Protoss and 3 to 5 against Terran If either one gets a buff the disadvantage he already has will get worse Protoss and Terran may be easier to counter than Zerg but if you don t know how to counter them that doesn t really matter
That was my point he s already losing basically every match against a non zerg in other words making that matchup harder won t actually affect his performance because he s already bottomed out On the other hand any nerf to zerg will only increase his bread and butter matchup
I think you re missing the fact that he will have to face many more terran and protoss if they get buffed
That s true The statement was a little bit tongue in cheek
Zerg isn t OP Nearly all the builds and strategies are just out of date Adjust
Isn t 40 of the masters and grandmasters ladders currently Zerg Nearly double the number of Protoss players What other reason would explain such a massive gap
I d add diamond to that stats based on personal experience and counting my own division Definitely more zerg than anything else
single divisions are random distributions and don t really count
Of course they are but as long as they are uniform they are good enough statistics Also note this guy s stats which my ladder stats mimic closely All sources point to overrepresentation of zergs in the higher leagues including the non parting Dreamhack group Hell even Parting lost a game to Bly
But they are random assignments of players being promoted at that particular time I am not sold that they can be considered to be uniform
last exp was a zerg one
We can only make sensationalist claims if the race in question is Protoss
Best joke ever
Its part of the game You have earned your place in diamond
Can I ask for your TvZ build then
It s just me winging it Usually something like CC rax gas OC OC gas fac into double ebay MMMM or tanks instead of mines if I scout Roaches on three bases push out with first two medivacs and start clearing creep drop if i think their army is out of position eventually my parade push and drops kill the zerg and they gg out If they survive until Ultralisks then I make Liberators I can link some replays of me beating diamond zergs next time I m at a computer
Yes please
Refer to this comment https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3uaibr i just got promoted to diamond turns out you only cxdyq3s
I know M Ms Medic Marines MMM Medic Marine Marauder Is MMMM Medic Marine Marauders Mines
yes It was the most common terran unit composition in tvz during all of Heart of the swarm so people just started calling it MMMM or just 4M
SC Marines SC BW M Ms WoL Medic Marine Marauders HotS 4M LotV Fuck the liberator Shoulda called it the Mliberator PS I just spent a whole minute saying Mliberator out loud
Mobile Justice
GLORIOUS We need a mod now that renames Liberators to Mobile Justice 5M for life
Here s some recent ish games against Diamond Zergs http lotv spawningtool com 4244 http lotv spawningtool com 4245 http lotv spawningtool com 4246 http lotv spawningtool com 4247 These games feature me going passive 3CC against both ling bane muta and roach ravager Have fun
Thanks you seem pretty good at tvz have you gotten your promo yet
I m currently in Diamond if thats what you mean Haven t played much since getting my promo and making this post Thanks
It will happen even more when you climb higher but you do deserve your league
me irl me isc2 I got to gold because I only recently found out that a 2 rax 1 factory and 1 starport early pressure build is great around the six minute mark for when they don t have mutas yet or don t have ravagers yet And the protoss melt like butter
You ve vsd one single protoss mate
That s the joke
When the Protoss doesn t have mutas yet
Exactly But in all seriousness that one game was weird since he tried making mass tempest after I destroyed most of his army in an engagement and I lost all of my marines
I know what you mean
Build
Just macro Mostly reaper expand into 6 hellions and 2 libs into bio Polt style
Thanks ok so 2 liberators before medivacs When do you take your 2nd gas
I take the 2nd gas right after the 2nd depot and before the factory When the 2 liberators are done you build an reactor with the starport and buid medivacs
Thank you
pretty sick
You could say XvZ is important
Damn Mcanning such a beast
Fucking love your guides dude Keep at em
Where can I find his guides Playing Protoss myself and I seem to struggle at the moment
http lotv spawningtool com build 8111 http lotv spawningtool com build 8110 http lotv spawningtool com build 8168
Have you always went by Chris
protoss is not that weak compared to the huge amounts of tears and salt we heard saw in the past and still do we soon will realise that
Regardless of strength this is about having to play almost twice the amount of Zergs than any other race when we play the ladder
lol im so bad vZ
Find an all in that works I have like a 65 PvZ by doing a 7 gate Warp prism all in
Can confirm that all in is hard to hold
C O I N F L I P B O Y S
Yep There s no point trying to play for a macro game right now Unless you are REALLY good
My WoL 2 base dts into blink all in is working pretty well in LotV
My nigga
TvP 40 TvT 40 TvZ 69 and that s mostly for blind countering roach ravagers
As a zerg who often goes roach ravager vs terran thank you for playing terran so I play fewer zvz matches
How does one counter roach ravager
Banshees
As a zerg I suppose you play terran I am yet to win any zvt in lotv They are just impenetrable You need to do cripling damage early on to not fall too far behind from liberators but you need to be on four bases yourself early on because of the reduced amount of larvae Stim marauder is still ridiculous and should be a tier 3 units If you go roach they go cyclone I am so lost
I literally never vs cyclone
Only saw them once and thought for the cost they kinda suck vs roaches tbh
If after 27 games you are already diamond it is probably also based on last season s
Nope You had your mmr reset since this is a new game
Not reset but adjusted http sea battle net sc2 en blog 18792768 starcraft ii ladder update april 27 2015 4 27 2015
Since your mmr is never shown do you have a source for this Because I find that hard to believe
It s a different game 12 worker start Nerfed economy New units New meta Different ladder Of course you get a new MMR
While those aren t bad arguments on their own it is not an official source
I was masters in hots I got placed gold in lotv So did most people Lotv is a new game and you have a new mmr for it
deleted
I take you are also just assuming because you think it makes sense but don t actually have a source
this might explain the confusion http sea battle net sc2 en blog 18792768 starcraft ii ladder update april 27 2015 4 27 2015
That is the same link from above and it is for hots not lotv
holy crap you re right My bad
Thanks thats exactly why I think a source is more important then common sense
As I supsected mmr was not reset but merely adjusted http sea battle net sc2 en blog 18792768 starcraft ii ladder update april 27 2015 4 27 2015
That is from April It doesn t say anything about MMR and new expansions
Luckily for you the higher your MMR goes the more zergs you ll face too
According to nios kr Diamond is the league with the highest percentage of Zerg in it
Haha that s awesome esp with that vP winrate Why do you think you re having trouble with P or were the games close and the small sample size belies your actual skill
I m really stubborn and insist on playing HotS compositions and pure bio just seems to lose to Adepts every single game Not a single one of those TvPs were close Do you know an easy and relatively safe TvP build that lets me get the multitasking and drops going without dying to Adepts
I can ask my masters terran friends or point you to r allThingsTerran since I m a protoss player myself In my own experience though bio is still effective against P Smaller engages yes adepts will win But once you have medievacs P has to have higher tier units same as before but now instead of storm colossi it s storm disruptor 1 2 early liberators especially if you can keep them alive cause silly amount of problems I can t really speak that much more since we re in the same skill bracket so eh
The builds on r ATT mostly involve cyclones and I want to avoid using them for as long as possible because I think they re a stupid unit Like I said I m stubborn to the point that it hurts me If your masters friends know any cycloneless builds I d love to hear them
CC first into 3 rax CC rax rax rax OC OC gas gas depot depot bunker in that order is quite decent But you need to make some blind turrets to defend DTs and you need to position your bio really well to beat warp prism
What addons on the raxes and how many marines before building them This is a really tempting build I am going to try it when I get home
You build a tech lab as soon as you can afford it and consistently produce marines until then The timing of the tech lab depends on when you build your gases which can vary based on how much you feel you need your bunker
yo whats your goto TvP build 16 rax gas into reactor rax Then cc Factory after 2 rines don t say cyclones Only if I m in a bad mood tongue emoticon Anyways then Rine pressure with 1st widow mine Whenever its out Bait enemy stalker into widow mine Works way less with better players If don t plan on pressuring then straight to 1 lib If for some reason you have enough gas I e You put the 2nd gas down as soon as the factory went down you can reactor lib But that really delays stim Alright thanks bro I ll relay this peace
cyclones are really good at defending warp prism drops because of the lock on
You should really try a cyclone opener I didn t liked the unit first but it s really good against warpprism pylons and adepts
Make a reaper then marauder in the early game The marauder helps against pylon rushes as well Then you can transition to banshees liberators or stim with the early tech lab
That tvt looks alot better than mine
My Lotv experience so far http i imgur com AOcthlS jpg 1 When do these zergs appear
Yeah those zergs are everywhere in lotv I dont know if people go to the race they think is most op or if zerg is just much more fun But what build are you using in in TvZ I dont have a bad record in the matchup a bit over 50 in diamond but it dont feel good
idk I for one played mostly zerg since WoL I wonder for many current zergs this is true as well
I did not mean to blame anyone in my comment I just wonder how many that changed race because chance of easier wins Even in beta I saw a lot more zergs
I ve played Zerg since the beginning of WoL but I think from my experience EU ladder has always had more zerg than other races It s always been mostly Zerg some Protoss and basically no Terrans
Refer to this comment https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3uaibr i just got promoted to diamond turns out you only cxdyq3s context 2
I m only good at XvZ and kept me plat or dia despite the fact that I m terrible and lazy as fuck in learning playing 1V1 I play toss and zerg
I find it strange that there are 10 more than T and 6 7 more than P of zerg in the ladder NA EU then why are like 50 of my games PvZ
Can anyone tell me why Z is so popular I picked Z because I played Protoss in WoL Terran in Hots and now its Zergs turn
it s most fun more vision more viable styles less reliance on getting damage done I have offraced Terran alot but i just keep on coming back to Z only whenever Terran becomes mass biospamstyle only played that 2010 12 not interested in it anymore but nothing else is viable at the moment
Blizzard made zerg easier to play in lotv and terran and toss were both made harder
Just because of Inject queuing I d actually argue Zerg got harder for lower league player because of the 3 larvae limit Lower league players won t keep up on the injects anyway
for players silver and below possibly but the units are a lot easier to micro now compared to T P just burrow some lurkers and throw a few corrosive biles and your set for diamond in terms of micro wise and Z has always been simple to micro once you get the hang of it compare this to Terran where they HAVE to drop or they will lose because their units are so weak in most engagements or P where they have to micro so much more now between blink stalkers adepts moving the observers in place to kill the lurkers and the disrupters as well as really the new eco fucking them over because protoss always struggled to get an expansion up in the first place this really is legacy of the zerg and I hate it coming from a zerg player my games are like 70 ZvZ where you just cheese or have to micro like life to win fair enough ZvZ is a harder matchup though so zerg players from HotS all have really high winrates in it compared to people switching races
I still suck at zerg but I was masters terran
Obviously your going to have a bit of trouble getting to the same level it is still a completely different race mate just because its an easier race doesnt mean your the same level as your other race if that makes sence
This is mine 7 PvP 15 PvT 30 PvZ Diamond
Congrats mate I just recently started playing SC2 and I also want to main terran Could you give me some advice against TvZ
Build lots of bio macro your heart out Don t get supply blocked Buipd double upgrades from double ebay Don t worry about micro
As a terran who loves TvZ even when it s strong as fuck I love this Used to be in Diamond at the end of HoTS currently in gold having a blast though I could play TvZ all day If they do nerf zerg its gonna be hard because we re all going to be so strong in out XvZ matchup
I was 17 3 in TvZ with a 2 racks 2 reactors 1attack and went rank 4 diamond as random I m was like 38 in ZvZ 85 in TvZ and 63 in PvZ I switched back to Protoss cause I feel the race is the funnier to play at the moment but I m now rank 81 Protoss life is hard now Zerg is brutal
I switched to Terran in LOTV I don t mind the massive amount of T v Z D
SC2 Newcomer picking a race Oh There s this human race with human Fuck them I m sick of humans Hmm This psionic race with advanced te Fuck them too all of this beautifuly designed and light structures and units too fluffy Ooohh an insectoid race people hate insects they must be so cool with the underground lifestyle and I want to look cool too at least on SC2 world because I ve failed in everything else in my life This is how I picked Zerg TL DR Zerg hipster race
Terran is OP now watch any pro tournament Or maybe this thread is about Low master and below balance then sorry my bad
I have a 70 winrate vs zerg 60 vs protoss but 30 vs terran and got promoted to master league rofl It turns out that zerg is 46 of all master league and 42 of all diamond league so you really only need to be good vs zerg indeed Edit on NA at least
I know 4M was the go to TvZ build in HOTS the problem with that is that as a gold I didn t have the control necessary to use mines properly If you re below plat it was better just stick to straight bio bio tank or mech in HOTS I think Mech especially after the Swarm Host nerf
Seriously how do you beat zerg as terran I can t fucking do it I die to mutas so hard turrets doesn t matter liberators need 12 like what the hell I have like 30 marines running around with their heads cut off and can t kill anything
Refer to this comment for my builds https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3uaibr i just got promoted to diamond turns out you only cxdyq3s I pretty much just try to outmuscle the zerg with pure macro I play kind of greedy but I also build a blind bunker and blind turrets at the appropriate timings Mutas shouldn t kill you if you build turrets and then scout to see if they are continuing to ramp up their Muta production Also if you re constantly fighting then they can t keep hitting your mineral lines because they need the Mutas to fight your army and snipe mines tanks TvZ is about push and pull if they keep you pinned down with Mutas you can never move out but if you keep them on the back foot they can never hit your mineral lines in the first place
dont mean to diss on ur parade u just have a few games and u quickly went to diamond so you probably been diamond lots of times before or higher and u were just meeting shitty people That being said atm there are tons of gm protosses beating the top Zergs and they are figure out strategies n shit all the time I lose a lot vs the clever all ins ppl just copy what the top guys are doing like they always have so what if it s harder and a bit tricker u can still be semi polite to ur opponent And most zergs also agree on the issues people have put forth That being said good good that it s hard for Protoss now they been king of bullshit for awhile now
Had some sessions yday and today what kinda pisses me off is how everyone is jumping on the bandwagon And really super nasty start of the game start with insults right of the bat So many angry Protoss players Was nastiest at the bottom whilst playing up even higher game starts LOL ZERG and then some sarcy comments then after game is ending an insult before leave and block Also been watching some streams lately and for fun i put on some stream from rly low ranked female streamer Even her was super spiteful and a dick to her zerg opponent and she could hardly even play She just copied what she read and heard on forums Whilst her 2 base Void ray failed micro like it was her first time playing a pc game And then the same phrases you see from salty good Protoss players Grrrr maybe just ran into bad rng last few days where most of the people I ve been meeting are thicker not that bright people That said I ve never liked Protoss in sc2 so fkn boring always i could feel the mechanics was easiest i could feel the race was so much easier than their counterpart Now for the first time I ve started enjoying it playing it more and more as offrace i don t do that well either but it s rly fun feeling ur on the backfoot and not just go 3 base get ur army and go or cheese every game Ok that got way to long lol tl dr it s kinda cool and each time i lose to a protoss they play rly well out multi tasking me so love that part of it
its super hard to improve as a player when you face over half of your matches vs zerg and then you get thrown into a pvt or pvp Then it turns into I dont now wtf to do hope this works moment Sometimes when i ladder i dont even read the race I just assume it is zerg now 70 of the time that is correct
lmfao 10 10Just the day before they re about to offer a period of double experience haha
When did they announce that
Announced today and starts tomorrow
Oh wow Well I hope they release Karax soon
Or Abathur Dehaka Horner Alarak Fenix Mira etc The list goes on and on and on and on
I think they said that Stukov and Horner are going to be released after Karax
Strings for those three commanders were data mined out a few months ago so I hope they ll come soon
A Nova commander will probably also come out when her campaign comes since they explained that she has her own Covert Ops units with different abilities they gave the example of stim that heals
When and where did you hear about the new commanders I really hope for new maps Maybe one thats just pure survival like the old days where the bonus objectives is just living longer or one where you get 3 bases
When looking through the allied commanders mod file I saw mention of Stukov s revive scripts near Zagara s Personally I haven t seen mention of the other heroes but I haven t dug too deep
I know this was posted last night but community feedback update just basically confirmed more heroes maps
Somewhere on the battle net forums I never bookmarked the link tho
they re offering double exp when is this
What s the best commander that s best for pubbies What s best for supporting friends If you could review all the commanders that d be awesome I personally like the last 3 commanders they re the most broken imo Thanks
I would say Zagara or Vorazun is best for randoms once you get high level enough Zagara spawns two drones at once so you can saturate really quickly and you can max in around 10 mins And Vorazun has ridiculous DPS with the dark templar plus you can mind control units with dark archons Makes beating the temple mission super easy which is the hardest mission for co op so far Raynor is pretty good too once you get to a high level The other 3 are somewhat underpowered
Vorazun is honestly the easiest one to play right now I don t get why they said Vorazun is hard when she s pretty much the most versatile I really find Artanis weak
I ve found Artanis to be very easy actually Reavers Phoenix shield boosting storm archons and aoe zealots are really good
The keeping units alive shield is soo good though always makes me happy to get matched with an Artanis
Agreed
The main downside of Artanis is having really weak zealots until you get whirlwind which many times almost shoehorns you into getting twilight council first after level 4 I wish the zealots of Artanis had normal attack damage and once upgraded was reduced to compensate for the whirlwind because they absolutely suck
Not to mention most of his units are immobile Then again as much as I love Dragoons they re just awfully and stupidly slow
I always wondered why Artanis doesn t get carriers when Raynor has BCs and Kerrigan has BLs Ultras They are easily my favourite unit
Probably saving carriers for a new protoss commander
It makes sense to me though cause the original crew would be Raynor Kerrigan and Tassadar Artanis is a newbie sorta commander so all his units would be expansion style units since he came in around Brood War Though we were Artanis in the original Starcraft it seems But i guess its just that feel in my opinion
My question is how come we can t make scouts with Artanis If there s any commander that should let you build scouts it s Artanis
selendis or urun maybe D
Those dragoons also love to path block zerg Still he kinda makes up for it with his 5 second save from death ability
During the campaign I would train 12 15 drags and 4 engergisers they boost move and attack speed so now I have super fast drags works like a charm
Yeah I didnt think about that I always rush twilight with him Makes pheonix builds slow A shame since pheonix are actually really good
Can t be any easier than Dark Templar Corsair spamming
You think so From my somewhat limited experience I d say that the terrans are probably the weakest Jimmy feels really underwhelming right now but I m not very high level yet I m surprised Kerrigan makes your underpowered list Imo her Zerglings get super OP once you have all the upgrades they attack 3x sec on creep have 45HP and reduce every enemies armour to 0 which skyrockets their dps hard
Marine marauder medic with some supporting tanks is really strong Raynor BC for Yamato the banshee are food too
They also die super fast Try attacking a group of enemies with HT or some other aoe and watch them all disappear in a matter of seconds In general Kerrigan s units are super squishy besides the ultras and broods
Raynor can also make 2 marines at once with the add on and if you spam barracks you can quickly rebuild an army
And don t forget the instant supply depots double mule
I play Swann on very hard and the Temple level is simple for defending I handle all defenses and send out a couple tanks and goliaths to take out bonuses and hybrids Turrets make a lot of missions very simple for Swann
Well done I really need to play this mode
Holy shit gratz How long did that take
About 125 games all brutal difficulty which is approximately 40 hours total A bit of luck is involved as well Having good partners and the right missions I always do random for the extra xp is pretty important
Wow and you had to win all of them right
What does co op contain is it Campaign or like specific missions
It s like skirmish missions All are timed sort of missions but they are fun
It s like melee except you work with a partner to accomplish various objectives within a given timeframe And you new skills and passive abilities as you level up to help you
Nice I have all to 10 but only 3 are at 15 Getting close though
One thing I would highly recommend is looking for a co op partner via General chat If you random every time there s always a chance you ll get an idiot and lose the mission happens to me about 30 of the time Always go brutal random and if you get the temple mission which is ridiculously hard and a pain to beat quit and preroll
I ve done all brutal since I was about lvl 5 but yeah I will reroll temple if I get someone less than lvl 10 But it s really not that bad with a Vorazun DTs Raynor MMM and or Kerrigan mass hydra lurker I don t think Since you ve gotten them all to 15 which are your favorite least favorite heroes
Even if you have a high leveled ally if he doesn t know how to macro well you ll still get overrun and lose I ve played with level 15s before on temple and still lost miserably cause they don t produce quickly enough Favorite is Vorazun least favorite Artanis
And the occasional AFKer so annoying
I am floating a lot of gas playing Vorazun with a stalker voidray dark templar build Any tips
Make lots of dark archons and use them to mind control units
How Vorazun is gas starved with Sair DT or VR DT assuming constant air production DTs with shield upgrade barely die
Maybe I need to cut down on stalkers
I never produce stalkers with Vorazun even alone in brutal Why do you need them If it s to shoot up get a SG around the second wave so you have a pair of VR for the first air wave
I just like to blink micro I just go pure blink stalker void ray
if anyone is interested in leveling on EU let me know i just got Vorazun maxed out
Any Vorazun tips for each map or vs air detectors
You mean the one with shuttles Thats the most difficult one i think I find Vorazuns AA too weak for this one and focus on DT Archons stealing carriers VRs vikings few corsairs and counting on team mate to deal with air We won yesterday this way the other guy did pure mass bio I talk about brutal ofc The other maps are pretty straight forward and you can finish them by just massing dts with few archons
ever tried mass voidrays you justneed to dodge storms anything else will be no problem you can do some missions even 1v2 if your mate leaves
Grats Working on my last one being Kerrigan Just because I like zerg the least
Any suggestion in how to level up Raynor in a fun way Hes obviously the terran bio commmander But its gonna be pretty borring to just make marine marauder medic all the the way to 15
Nice I ve maxed out 4 working on the zerg hero s now We really need some more maps and scenarios though getting kinda stale already also some of the hero s are pretty OP compared to others
and portraits are still low qualityGood Events like this are good for the health of the game and community They should raise the level cap though or offer additional portraits for like 1500 2000 wins especially for those of us who have been playing the last 5 years
Lol I have been playing for the last 5 years and still haven t quite made it to 1000 wins I still have about 115 left to go I want that damn portrait already
This is very cool I love seeing those numbers
I still have to hit 500 in most categories
I feel like Co Op must have been designed with this in mind since even beating a mission on Hard with bonus objectives wont get you an upgrade later on This should make the grind actually bearable Though they desperately need to add more than 5 maps The boost for race levels will help casuals For hardcore people that already play all the time they are probably maxed I feel like they need some other form of progression for hardcore folks Probably something involving the Tournaments since I don t think trophies are that big a deal to keep people signing up long term with how frequent they are
um im done with most games in under 10 hours
I don t think a game being short is a good thing unless the game just drags on and on like Alien Isolation for example
It probably isnt but thats the reality a lot of even triple A games are short as hell Bet the dudes downvoting me got 100 shitty indie titles they havent even played in their steam talkin bout playing more than 10 hrs lmao
I ve been out of the loop for a little while How many levels are there now per race in Lotv
50
Too bad XP is completely and utterly useless for anything other than unlocking a few silly vanity portraits
You d be surprised what people care about One of the major Overwatch complains is a lack of progression or long term goals But yeah it s dumb
Maybe because in overwatch there is no goals outside of the game I mean they are no suprasegmental achievements goals whatsoever The problem with overwatch is that you are learning literally nothing for playing nothing can drop from you at the end of the match you don t get those virtual points currency and in the game you can t see your stats played it during Rtb2015 much better experience although point system is flawed in a way it was implemented before closed Beta there were some stupid ass multipliers for team kills yo ucould go on a 10 solo kill spree as an assassin adn you would be almost last on the scoreboard whereas a support sticking with the other guys together would be 1st 2nd very easily
I ve been playing OW non stop since Beta came out I d prefer it not have long term goals I think they re pointless and adding grinding into a game to unlock any gameplay affecting element of the game would absolutely kill it for me
I remember when I used to play games for fun
Most people still do play games for fun and level progression is pretty standard in games now
Apparently not if they need some sort of carrot to catch instead of actually playing the game because of enjoyment
The carrot is the enjoyment
the enjoyment of levelling up not he gameplay
Well you level up while you are playing the game during gameplay Let me explain I play Co OP missions Campaign and I m really looking forward when I unlock new units to try out play so I have enjoyment from reaching goals but then I enjoy playing them so I enjoy the gameplay as well Wy people enjoy games is not universal stop trying to categorize people into black and white categories where one are doing it right like you and other are not it s relative what each of us likes that s why there is no just one game out there
I believe that people still do enjoy the gameplay leveling and progression is a sort of a new concept that wasn t in games until recently but not is is pretty standard and progression is something people really like but there is nothing wrong with it Do you dislike progression and leveling up
Goals make the game really
Keep XP turned on It s a great tool to ensure you really did finish off that cloaked or burrowed unit
Yeah that s what I use it for too Kill confirmations are the only useful thing XP gives us
Why not tournaments every hour as the normal thing They should make it so that you get more points during this week or during tournaments to encourage play
well you want tournaments spread out enough to ensure good matchmaking Increasing tournament frequency when there is more player activity works fine though
They would lose their value It s ok right now
I would propose more rarity Every 6 hours 4 times a day That leaves enough time for every time zone and work schedule to have access to at least one tournament each day You lost try again tomorrow puts a bit more emphasis on playing your best than you lost you get 3 more tries tonight If you want to play more than that that s what Ranked and Unranked is for isn t it
lose game client closes
Don t be a casual
Why would they lose their value It d still be the same difficulty to win
So I ll ask you Would you watch IEM or DreamHack if it would be every week
As long as the games were entertaining to watch I would Just as I would turn off the stream if the games sucked I don t watch them because they re rare I watch them because you ve got some of the best players on the planet killing each other for our entertainment The truth of the matter is that if these tournaments only value is in the fact that they are rare then what you re actually doing is taking an inherently worthless tournament and advocating waiting longer to participate in it That s all it is The tournament isn t magically better if there are less of them it s the same tournaments just on a less frequent basis
Automated tournaments are not the same if I could enter a tournament every hour I would have a lot more freedom but the getting to play more wouldn t be bad if I could play tournaments only I would I don t see a reason to play ladder instead of tournaments unless you really need the time efficiency But I am Silver noob so take that as you wish
There is a middleground the developer should reach in order to match popularity for sure By making tournaments every 2 hours they are still accessible to everyone while they are rare enough that the game feature will still be interesting 6 months from now Shoving a tournament down our throat every hour is a perfect way to make them a boring gimmick down the road Blizzard did it perfectly by testing this out for a week long event a very rational choice IMO
This would be cool if XP actually mattered
Ill get from lvl 47 to lvl 50 for the final portrait that much quicker I suppose
That s as good a reason as any to play a bit more later this week
Experience points don t do anything Not to mention they give out way too much as it is And they want to double it What are we supposed to do with all this exp
Well i ve fallen apart from SC2 for a long time now due to Heroes and Overwatch beta But I feel kind of interested in these ladder tournaments Might try it this week and who knows a lucky trophy wouldnt look bad on my command center
Yay sounds fun D I might as well spend whole weekend playing Starcraft multiplayer About time to unlock those portaits and whatnotThanks god i m a worthless foreigner that don t have to go to army
Is he retiring I know he was considering it earlier this year to move back to Korea and retire around this time P
He could be going into military service as well
i love requesting shitty music on his stream
for anybody that wants some tracks i requested through donations https www youtube com watch v 2hSlcWrUKs https www youtube com watch v vaZJK79ARo https www youtube com watch v jRRBBPv6us8 https www youtube com watch v sNp2nCtwoJs https www youtube com watch v Q16KpquGsIc https www youtube com watch v MNNwVtZsPwU
lol wtf why Poor Forgg
You know there s a word for what you do Sadism
i m actually quite submissive in bed
take it boy
which way are you trying to get me to roll
the dungeon master way
let me get my socks
I can t imagine trying to concentrate on playing SC2 while listening to those tunes
for money who gives a fuck
I m pretty sure he s got virtual audio cables installed so he doesn t have to listen to that shit
Pretty sure he does listen to it judging by wincing on some of the tracks visually
May God rest ForGG s and your soul
osu player
mostly BMS but yeah a lot of this trash is on osu that s actually the main reason i quit people called this garbage J pop and legit enjoyed it i got so sick of it i left
I play rap on osu
Hey the second video is actually decent until halfway through though
It s I trusted you and watched the whole thing Kappa
What is this genre of music called I m serious Doesn t sound like what you would classically call dubstep
which one hit and run in 1920 AD is the only one that s real music i love lapfox but nobody i know can listen to it without wanting to kill themselves so i request shit like that the rest are japanese parodies of real music night of nights owen was her highscore etc
you love starcraft AND Lapfoxtrax i like you
Man I remember when that McDonald song came out that was my jam way back then
This is you
Beautiful You re doing God s work
2hu faggots
Looks like the Forsenboys culture is leaking
i have no idea wtf that is
A stream where people donate money to play only gay bdsm porno sounds and music with 20k viewers What a time to be alive twitch tv forsenlol
Officially confirmed on his stream that its because his visa is running out not army or retiring imgur com pdCUKE3
fuck protoss man
1 million refugees into our social welfare system is ok but somebody who is actually contributing needs to go
Yeah fuck all those people who don t have a home to go back to
you are cruel man
Interesting move Either personal reasons he is leaving Millenium and or he knows something about new WCS season we don t yet
He s going back because he has do to compulsory military service sometime next year
I hope they give him a position that takes advantage of his experience Like walling off the border harassing enemy command centers and setting up tank formations
gonna need someone else to make sure the wall is up though
This made me wonder how players like Polt have put off military for so long According to liquipedia Polt is 27 Another would be Bomber who is nearly 30 iirc While Forgg for reference is only 25
Bomber is the same age as Polt I believe but yeah its weird they can go so long I assume for Polt its because he is studying in America but I m not sure why Bomber doesn t have to go
Polt will probably end up doing KATUSA which is where you do service for US army in Korea because you can speak good English It s more chill and you go home on weekends
Woah TIL Thanks for the info as a Polt fan I am pleased to hear he has that option
Polt completed his study two years ago if what I ve been told is correct
Bomber is also 27 not quite nearly 30
deleted
If you are an able bodied male korean citizen you must do military service eventually If you move out of the country to avoid it you likely have to be ok with never going back as you will risk legal issues when you step foot back in Korea
Yeah I went to grad school with a guy who was from the US had dual citizenship and gave up his Korean citizenship so he wouldn t have to go back and serve
thats pretty crazy
Or you are a member of an important Chaebol clan I cant see the boys of the samsung ceo play in the mud
maybe harder region locking
If ForGG can t pass this harder region locking its 100 region locking since he Polt and viOLet are the epitome of players who live long term in their regions
deleted
I think you re a bit mistaken my friend Polt has lived a majority of his life in America for the past three years His primary residence is in Georgia and prior to that he was studying at the University of Texas He s lived here full time longer than any other Korean pro
deleted
Such as whom He has an American girlfriend lives in an American home eats in American restaurants and plays on the NA ladder The fact that he ll even ladder on NA is good for the scene What exactly do you expect him to contribute He s a serious progamer he s not going to show up to local LANs which I don t think there even are any in Atlanta He streams regularly He s nice to people and accessible to fans What more do you fucking want him to contribute Besides the folks at Basetrade folks like Lowko Feardragon and other similar people sorry for leaving many people out there aren t a whole lot of people contributing in a very public and open way People who play the game are friendly try their best and entertain sure contribute a heck of a lot more than most do I m not even personally a fan of Polt s but you re being ridiculous against him for no reason and you obviously don t have any facts to back up what you re saying
Not really he spend the first three months of 2015 in Korea thanks to Desrow for that info but has lived full time in US since He took a 4 day vacation to Korea before WCS and we know that from his streaming schedule
deleted
What StarDust doesn t play SC2 anymore he retired and like ForGG and viOLet he s lived in his respective country for years now Hydra has been here a year and if he stays as expected he obviously will be seen in the same light Polt along with ForGG and viOLet are the epitome of foreign Koreans ForGG will leave that group and Hydra will join it Just don t make stuff up about him living in the US for most of the year
Stardust lived in Europe somewhere for 2014 and moved to NA this year before retiring a long time spent in the foreign scene JD spent as long in the US as Polt this year and you re not giving him any credit at all Polt gets so much love for being Captain America because he waved a flag despite not knowing what it even meant or symbolised his words not mine
I m guessing this might have something to do with it https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3itzj4 forgg to retire in october or november
That s pretty surprizing
army maybe
Hopefully he will play GSL
Donations help keep streaming
I think it s because the Korean government is fussy about them living outside Korea when they get to a certain age they don t like renewing passports and visas when you ve not done army duty yet Hopefully he keeps on playing it ll be a shame to lose him
sure hes a good guy and all but his country needs him to do the military service not such a shame imo hes had his time in bw and such i could think of 10 players it would actually be a shame to lose right now forgg not one of them
The only reason I think it d be a shame to lose anyone is sentimental attachment I like ForGG I enjoy watching him play so I think it d be a shame if he has to do army service now and would rather see him as a pro for longer My 10 would be Flash JD ForGG sOs Maru Inno SortOf MorroW Rogue and Keen sOs Maru and Inno are the only ones there who would have an impact on the game if they were to stop playing maybe Flash but I don t know how much of a draw in Korea he is now but it doesn t stop me from thinking it would be a shame to lose the others
yeah man i can understand that a lot i also love all the old school sc2 pros TOP Mvp Genius Squirtle leenock im kinda sad the current sc2 scene isnt what it used to be but thats just normal i guess people move on and times change just 2011 was a great time for me i ve always loved Keen too i saw him streaming a month ago or so and he has crazy mechanics im glad hes still around at least if only supernova could join sbenu aswell guess im just venting now
Depends on what you mean He still has the chance to play at Blizzcon but he wont be playing against people in WCS America He will be playing in the GSLs and SSLs in order to get the chance to play at Blizzcon
I should write WCS Premier League Thx for fix
i think this is a good thing a majority of koreans that leave the country do it because they can t compete with fellow koreans and their skill starts to lower forgg has fallen in between being better than pretty much every foreigner but being a bit lower than most korean players hopefully moving back reverses this
Problem is Koreans start going to NA now
oh my goodness if this means we have a proper region lock in WCS I m gonna weep tears of joy Blizzard Entertainment s esports division saving esports EDIT Or it could just mean Millennium canned him for intentionally team killing during that one set of qualifiers this year
Yeah the ForGG rule just made another loophole for players like Hydra to exploit I say good riddance
What loophole Pro players are mostly fine with players moving to other regions playing on their ladders and contributing to their scene and winning What they re not okay with is them just flying over just for matches and dominating because they live in the region with the best available practice they want there to be an ecosystem
Army soon Boys No offense but ForGG has been playing for a long time and I don t see him achieving high level KR play anymore
ITT A complete lack of grammar and punctuationHuk switched to this stream and I was pretty impressed by how entertaining this guy is
Maybe because of huks sexual orientation
Wait is huk really gay or is this a joke
Everybody is gay when it comes to Fenna
How about women
They faint too fast for their sexuality to even be considered
He dated is dating Smix So probably a joke although maybe she is a beard or he is bi who really knows http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Smix https twitter com DeMusliM status 438736791974477824
Are you blind They re hairy as fuck
aka normal
Honestly that depends where you grew up live Here in mid west europe shaving armpits is pretty much standard from age 15 40 After that you kind of stop caring
Not that standard Lived in Ireland and the UK for 25 years have not known a single guy who shaves his pits
As I said Depends where you live Reddit downvoting stuff that does not fit your lifestyle That s kinda sad
Well I wouldn t cast the net so wide as to say it s pretty much standard in Western Europe from age 15 40 that s a huge exaggeration
Well but you guys do the same right You say not shaved is normal and pretty much assume that this is the normal because this is how people at your place culture live Just like me And yet I get downvoted because you guys don t want to feel not normal That s hypocritical
Nah it s not
Dunno why you get downvoted so much lol Probably too many neckbeards that are too lazy to shave But yes shaving armpits and also chesthair is pretty standard in west europe
You probably didn t hit puberty then They look normal to me
Someone has never seen a real hairy man You re gonna have a hard time finding a man with less pit hair than him that doesn t shave
TIL I am Chewbacca I am not even that hairy besides my armpits
What about them
Nothing I needed a clickbait title
Dang it Koreaboo
This is Daniel Fenner come join us over at http www twitch tv fenn3r
I love Fenn3r Nobody gives you the wurm like he does
faaaaaaaaaaaaaabulous
Weee are the champions my friends
I immediately thought of Richard Simmons with Fenner doing that pose

Freddie Mecury
is it me or does fenner look a little bit like JackSeptic eye
The fact that they cut off his hands makes what would be an otherwise nice picture of a happy gay man weird as hell
looks like someone was a high school cheerleader
STOP LOOKING AT ME FENNER you are making me blush
fenBooty
I turned it off when he said all Americans are idiots for saying Aluminium wrong
He did this with a shitty Key Board right
A tank top It s almost like it s summer where Fenner is but that would be crazy
LotV is out he needs medivac to lift that Tank and drop it to the floor fenBooty
I made the same pose after winning a gold tournament
Good job winning D why the sad face
Thanks It was just because his achievement is so much bigger But it was awesome for me anyways and only that should matter you re right D
Bonus image that s his subreddit btw
Pure perfection of a human being I can t spot any flaws in this picture not one Man sometimes I wish I was a woman so I could admire him even more
I tuned in to Fenn3r s twitch channel once by copy pasting the URL into my browser s address bar Once in the channel I was typing some kind of greeting but accidentally hit ctrl v pasting the url into my message right before I sent it Fenn3r saw it and started mocking me for intentionally linking to his own channel in his chat calling me a dumbass Thanks but no thanks Asshole
I may be wrong but I m pretty sure I just said something along the lines of Why on earth would you link my own channel in the chat being confused as to why you would link my own channel to my chat Didn t mean to come off as offensive sorry mate
SJW level of butthurt
asshole D D BibleThumpNot gonna lie it made me laugh and nod my head in agreement The game is hard it is stressful it is competitive and if you lose it is only your fault That is exactly why I play it edit I feel i should add this is not the only reason herp derp just because its hard There simply is no other game that feels as rewarding in my eyes Every win feels awesome and I have trained myself so that every loss is an opportunity to get better i used to get angry at myself but now i laugh and have a more analytical outlook It is fun just a more intense kinda fun and i m into that
I blame protoss
You cant blame protoss in their own expansion Werent 2 enoguh
No I gotta be salty about protoss It s my duty Even though TvP is my best match up I gotta hop on that band wagon
I posted this in the original post as well But I get a different feeling when I win There s an overwhelming relief that I didn t get my ass kicked and can finally give my brain a break followed by a small sense of accomplishment
For me it s not stressful in the losing competitive sense it s just stressful to play in general You always feel like you re never fast enough you always have 30 things to tend to your mind is in total overload mode the entire game operating at 100 10 15 minutes of constantly operating at that level is what I d call stressful No other game that I ve played requires as much mental strain as SC And I never even got out of Plat
chess feels similar but with less adrenaline rush
Not similar at all imo Chess is a game with no real time limit and perfect information It s nothing like as stressful because you re not constantly thinking what could I be doing better It s certainly satisfying to win and can be very stressful but I don t like the comparison at all Starcraft has more in common mentally with just about any real time game or sport than it does with Chess
Speed Chess where you are on a 10s timer for each move is a better comparison
Yeah agreed
you sir have no clue about chess
Sure fine Hey how about this You sir have no clue about sports Useful contribution right
Not gonna lie I ve broken things when I lost before Not that I get violent or anything but sometimes when I lose games in stupid ways I just knock things off my desk in anger
And it s dead
OMG its Deader than ded it s superDED I had to wait up to 25 seconds to Find Match at the end of hots I mean Hello I don t have that much free time Blizzard I m busy you know
Right And LoL is such a live game I have to wait a measly 4 minutes to get into a queue And then 5 minutes to pick a champion And then another 5 when someone dodges But man all that time waiting is just icing on the cake when my team mates start yelling at each other because they made a mistake literally anyone could make But such alive game man can you feel it
I ve never played LoL but is that seriously what it is like Is it true the average game length is like 30 minutes Seriously that is insane No wonder they get the rep for being ragers i don t blame them i would be angry if i had to wait 10 minutes before for each game began
Games are faster now because they borked their most recent major patch so games end faster than it actually takes to fully get into a game Once you get into queue averages around 3ish minutes Each team leader randomly chosen gets 30 seconds to ban a champion they don t want to appear in the game Then the other team gets 30 seconds to pick the next one Up to 6 bans and 6 sets of 30 seconds later players can start picking champions Everyone gets 60 seconds to pick when it is their turn to pick and there are 6 sets of 60 second rounds for all 10 to pick champions If everyone locks in a champion the timer ends early and jumps to the next round Then there s a mandatory 30 second waiting period at the end of picking where you can swap champs with team mates and fix any mistakes in spell mastery selections Oh and then load screens Usually it takes about 10 12 minutes in total as bans are generally quick per set up and if anyone decides to drop queue and quit it starts all over from the start sitting in queue accepting queue picking bans picking champ Longest I ve waited between games was when there were 4 successive dodges during the 30 second period at the end and I waited 35 minutes between games
Sound a bit exhausting but obviously people are into it I imagine there is a lot of strategy and knowledge in this part of the game So much knowledge in knowing what the other person is capable of let alone what you can do and all the best items and strategies
The champ selection is just more annoying downtime than anything else And that s the thing for LoL and Moba s in general There s a lot to know but not a lot to do you control one champ with 4 abilities 2 spells and potentially item actives Best example of it from SC2 is the hyperion mission in HotS That s pretty much league except there s another hyperion on the other team you have to play around In SC2 there s not as much to know but there s a lot to do all the time Last difference There s no real downtime in a game of SC2 You re building stuff producing units scouting around watching your army and doing your macro mechanic In league there s downtime when you shop when you die when you re heading back to base regrouping with team mates and split pushing All of these things make the game more relaxing because you get a break where you don t need any real APM for a significant amount of time

I mean a lot of the reason that LoL is so much more popular is that it s a considerably easier game Non players watching pro LoL games have a much easier time jumping in and microing a single hero unit than they do learning macro micro builds timings unit compositions etc from the ground up
Exactly from the words of my former master s Terran friend from college I don t have the time to ladder competitively anymore I work 40 hours a week where I have to be mentally sharp the whole time League is more suited to me now these days as I just want to come home chill out play with some friends who admittedly are not too amazing at the game and not have to stress as much
This Also since League is a team game if we lose I can just think Well those asshole teammates just cost me the game and when I win it s I carried those chumps When I lose Starcraft though it s all I am the WORST person to have ever played this game I should crawl in a hole and die I m so stupid
See for me it feels worse when I think the reason I lost was out of my control Like how dare those assholes ruin my game sort of logic
This is the reason I usually mute all other players at the start of the game
lol that s why i stick with 3v3 and 4v4 in SC
I remember when I introduced my friends to Starcraft 2 from League where they always blamed each other Now they blame themselves
Hearthstone ladder is 1v1 format just as SC2 but part of the reason why HS ladder doesn t bother people that much is because the game is so reliant upon luck which is something Blizzard must have figured out was the correct way to go Losing in HS is always omg I can t believe he drew exactly the card he needed or I didn t draw the card I needed so it s basically never your fault for losing That s a huge mental advantage when playing a game In SC2 there s only you and the enemy so you can t blame anyone else for losing
People who always blame their team mates in lol dont make any significant ranked progress in league either Same deal personal accountability
I thought the joke was omg X is op plz nerf
Just to play devil s advocate with sc2 you only need 1 build per matchup and you can ladder just fine as opposed to hundreds thousands of hero skill item interactions Also you can squeeze out an sc2 game pretty easily in 10 30 minutes whereas with lol or dota you re committing more like an hour of your time I would say it s just as easy to do either in the non professional level
Playing both I d say that DOTA LoL doesn t have that macro aspect which makes the game very much easier to fiddle around in When I realize I forgot to make workers when I m scouting building army units that insane facepalm I give myself
The macro game of LoL gets pretty tedious imo Teamfight and backtracking to various lanes just to push the minion wave only for that wave to be pushed back to your side of the map making you go back over there to push it again after another teamfight All so you can get your minions in every lane to push when you win teamfights
I pretty much gave up SC2 for LoL 2 years ago now and I can t say I regret it I love SC2 and I still follow the pro scene and enjoy hearing about it but honestly it s just nowhere near as fun It s all just doing what you re meant to be doing acting as much like a machine as possible Sometimes I d get creative with builds and stuff but you simply lose to someone with better macro so you need to improve your macro Maybe at the very lowest or very highest level there s room for creativity but everywhere else it s basically just how good you are at completing a large number of simple tasks LoL on the other hand is a lot simpler and has built in rest periods that make it a lot less taxing In LoL when you die you re not thinking oh man 3 minutes ago I needed to expand then I d have enough income to have enough production to fight him off here or oh man I should have built an evo chamber sooner so I could get spores in my mineral lines In LoL when you die you re thinking things like I shouldn t have greeded or I shouldn t have tried to kill him or whatever There s much less of a barrier between what you want to do and what happens so it s your DECISIONS rather than your execution that you blame I love SC2 a lot but I ll probably never play it seriously again It s just not a very pleasant way for me to spend my leisure time
There s a lot of complexity at the higher end of League of Legends though with proper build denying cs getting your opponent to react how you want them to how to engage or disengage properly kiting keeping tabs on people roaming kill potential power spikes summoner spell timers But at its base for very low levels you have a hero you go to a lane you try to kill the other guy Very simple Starcraft at its base mine minerals gas make an army kill the other guy The complexities of Starcraft at a high level are more so than League but by no means is League an easy cake walk P
For sure League definitely gets into a lot of technical complexity at high levels I d say the biggest distinction is that League is significantly easier to learn than Starcraft I d call League easy to learn and very hard to master I d call Starcraft hard to learn and ridiculously hard to master
It is however less stressful like the guy in the thread said
Yep It s just the raw apm required in starcraft that is so brutal At least playing lol you get down time to have a drink or scratch your balls
I live I die I live again
I think DOTA 2 is more stressful than sc2 and it isn t because it s harder I m afraid of getting the shit flamed out of me I have ladder anxiety bad and Im more busy than I used to be I enjoy knowing that win or lose it was on me and I can find some aspects of sc2 relaxing I could mass games of sc2 like crazy but solo queing in Dota is something I rarely do
I don t know what you re saying exactly 3 lol If you mean people from gold and below are trying to do those things then yes but the higher you go up the more important it all becomes to the point where if you re not doing that you ll probably lose
Team games have a lot of psychology working for it too more herd mentality thingy you don t feel the losses much your ego don t take that much of a beating probably tons of other reasons Also i think a lot of people hate being uncomfortable There s also at on of gamers who mainly play for entertainment enjoyment and don t want any extra stressors n shit like that
When I played starcraft I was top 50 masters consistently pretty much through all of HOTS In League I barely scrape gold around top 20 of the server As someone who has played a lot of both games I wouldn t say league is easier it requires a different set of skills which makes it a different game
I could see Hearthstone s popularity being for a very similar reason the easy to pick up and play aspect I mean when I had games of HS going I could prepare dinner clean my bathroom even do Pilates in between turns and still be winning my HS match LotV is much more engaging and intense and for me that s what makes it more fun
I don t think anyone disagrees with that but it s not necessarily meant as a compliment in the context of the post Some people prefer slower relaxing games they can play causally to games that require more mental energy or have a higher barrier of entry like StarCraft or fighting games I ve always compared them to American Football and Soccer American Football is complex hard to understand at first requires insane ammounts of athleticism equipment and has a ton of strategy the other one you can play it with your friends in the park sure you can throw a football in the park as well but you get the point
It s not the higher barrier of entry that holds SC2 multiplayer back IMO League and other MOBA s have just as high of a barrier with an immense amount of information that must be learned if you want to be good at the game What truly holds SC2 back from having a larger multiplayer population is exactly the stress Any competitive game is going to stress you out to some degree but SC2 takes it to the extreme even the slightest misstep can immediately end the game depending on what it is You have to move so fast and react so quickly that even while winning the game becomes exhausting It makes me sad that this is the direction that SC2 has been pushed relentlessly They think the game has suffered in popularity because it s not fast enough but I believe it s the opposite SC2 is a game I love but I can t enjoy multiplayer more than maybe a couple of games per week or sometimes month The game moves way to fast to be enjoyable for an extended period of time for most people some people are into it and more power to them but for a lot of people it just loses it s fun in the madness It disappoints me greatly that greater emphasis has not been put on making the game fun to play The non stop action can sometimes make a more exciting game to watch no doubt but League is one of the slowest games at a pro level and still gathers huge huge crowds because since the game is fun to play it s fun to watch regardless I wish Blizzard would ve understood this with SC2
Yes blizzard continues to push the game in more and more fragile directions Most units are huge damage low health designs and they continue to introduce very punishing mechanics banelings widow mines disruptors and extremely efficient harassment vectors medivac speed boost oracles mutalisks to the extent that more of your apm is dedicated to avoiding punishment than seeking reward Defending against harass and avoiding huge AoE units are both very frustrating it feels like the reacting player has to put in many times more work and constantly this is the position that starcraft 2 puts you in your proactive moves are usually brainless A move and instead you need to focus almost entirely on reacting Meanwhile we want to play RTS games so we can make interesting and strategic proactive moves The dream of the commander is to use careful positioning timing and control to out wit the opponent but the reality is that every moment seems more like manically scrambling to avoid losing everything than maneuvering to gain an advantage
Most of my friends that only have played lol and prety much their only competitive game aside from games like halo or the fifa games suffers of ladder anxiety they play really litlle ranked games and when they do it is on duoq they play the game and when lose a game get so frustated that lost any interest on palying the game for the day Looks like all my experience with the hard ladder that is SC2 ladder make feel the ladder LoL like a walk in the park
that is really interesting for me i find the more competitive games i play and the more i play them the less anxiety i get after playing sc2 for years i really don t care about rank just learning the game more and enjoying that process maybe if they played more games or broadened their competitive horizon it d help idk maybe it s just me
sc2 ladder 1on1 isnt thing for the weak minded in my eyes its man vs man woman and when you lose you lost on your own only other 1on1 computer game would be hearthstone but yeah in real life 1on1 physical sports would be only fighting sports and tennis as i can think of man vs man also its hard to find contacts easy because the main focus is on that 1on1 ladder sc2 boxing of e sports D check out dirtyela on twitch she s gold for a while now i think fun to watch and not such a pussy D D
This is a religion i could get behind haha
I think even the most die hard lol fans won t try to argue that league is more complex I think they will argue it isn t a bad thing Dota players on the other hand tend to go crazy when you tell them that a slightly harder moba is still just a moba
dota fanboys make fun of heroes and lol for being easy and when one of them says that dota is easy compared to SC they lose their minds and start nerdraging its absolutely hilarious to watch their insecurities bite them in the ass
Remember when destiny said LoL was harder than SC2
I don t remember that but that is pretty ridiculous Maybe if one player controlled all five champions it would be harder other than that it s a cake walk by comparison
I think you misunderstood He wasn t complimenting SCII when he said that
He may be complementing but he wasn t bashing it
yeah i know i just thought it would be funny to take something out of context and use it to mock what i don t like that sort of stuff is usually pretty funny
It s exactly why they play it over SC2 It s so much easier to enjoy a game of league even if you re losing than it is to enjoy a game of SC2 SC2 is just much more of a commitment on the personal level
Maybe they just play it over SC2 because it s more fun Have you ever considered that people have more fun playing other games This circle jerk is terrible Chess is infinitely more complex than SC2 but I don t see everyone here rushing to play it because of the complexity people play games they find fun It s as simple as that
I think the argument fot chess is its depth Of course sc2 has more mechanical skill involved That doesnt make it more complex as its not a factor you consider when comparing the complexity of chess and sc2 Chess has a ridiculous number of possible moves in sc2 the thing that makes it difficult is the time constraint you have to make a lot of moves You coukd argue that sc2 is more convoluted than chess But in terms of complexity I think chess has sc2 beat
Starcraft has infinitely more moves you can do especially since you re not bound to a grid The only reason chess looks like it s more complex is because you can actually visualize how massive the number of possibilities is SC2 is also more approachable Also the fact that you don t have vision of your opponent adds another layer of complexity and strategy where scouting has to be taken into your calculations as well as the hidden strategies and mind games
yeah i meant it mainly as a joke haha but yeah i see LoL as much more casual also i m curious what you mean about commitment on the personal level you piqued my curiosity please indulge
I meant to say on the individual level but it would have been more or less the same Basically in SC2 if you want to try something cool you have to do everything leading up to it yourself Want to counter banes with well split marines You have to learn that You want to create Immortals that can trade infinitely You have to learn the timing and the Warp Pris micro In League you only need to set up a single part of the cool thing you re doing say a tower dive quadra with an ADC you will have to have the team set it up for you and offload a ton of the work there even blame if it fails Also there s no off time in SC2 apart from the beginning of the a game Afterwards it demands your entirety LoL on the other hand has many breaks When you go to shop when you die when you ace the enemy team etc Lots of time to rest your injured psyche
Problem is people know this and have chosen a less stressful game on purpose This is exactly why many want to hype up Archon mode now in LOTV It s the same builds same gameplay as 1v1 but its a lot more relaxed for players involved I truly believe this that archon mode is the road that can let SC2 have a noob playerbase Which the game really needs
huh I guess I m weird but I find the 1v1 aspect of it all riding on you way less stressful than the 5v5 of mobas when if you have a team mate feeding or not cooperating you can loose at no fault of your own it s infuriating
Whiners and feeders is a horrible experience for sure but it doesn t really fuck up your ego at all since it s someone else s fault A lot of people especially men have a very sensitive ego and have a huge problem with punishment being wrong
that s true at the end of the game you can always look down your nose at the filthy casuals and even grow your hubris
It s not easy to compare because the two are so different and reqiure different things to be good at It s clear that you can t micro like you can in Starcarft and you especially don t have to multitask micro and macro like you do in starcraft But the thing about LoL is that it has a lot of depth that is not visible when you watch a guy over the shoulder in a sc2 vs LoL apm comparison video In sc2 you can immediately see how many button presses are required and how many times he switches the screen And if a LoL pro makes a play it can look like he just decided to kill the guy when really he put a lot of thought in it Example of things you have to know when you do say an all in in bot i e killing the other 2 guys with your 2 guys What is the match up Who has more burst Who should we focus Do they have flashes up exhaust up heal up Do WE have flashes up exhaust up heal up Does their toplane have TP and if yes is it up Does OUR toplane have TP and if yes is it up Do they have any key abilities on cooldown Do WE have any key cooldowns on cooldown Where is their jungler Where did he last show up Could he be waiting for our all in in the lane bush Where is OUR jungler Where is the enemy mid Do they have any globals up How is the wave position How much damage will each side take from minions If the majority of these points are in your favor you could go for a kill on the enemy botlane For a spectator this would look like the 2 guys just used all their abilities on the other 2 guys and killed them nothing hard to do
This describes late game PvP really well From an observer standpoint it s a laser beam light show As a player you need to know through scouting and intuitiveness of the matchup How many bases is he on Where s the MsC How many Colossus does he have How many Colossus do I have How many Archons does he have I have How many Stalkers Phoenix Tempest does he have I have If the majority of points are in your favour you can go on the offensive But you still have to consider Can I push his ramp Can he counter drop me Do I have a proxy pylon Where should I put my proxy Where is the best place to engage And after all that you still need to set your army up for an engage Have I scouted if he has proxy pylons near the engage point Can I keep all my zealots in front or will I get flanked Do I have enough archons to handle zealot bloat Do I have enough stalkers to handle air units Do I have any observers or oracles available for DT warpins Can he get a concave when I have my concave Late game PvP was a very knowledge based and intensive matchup But watching the matchup Laser light show
You make a very good comparison but what you write includes every aspect of the late game PvP matchup like every protoss unit and unit composition while my example is a single situation that could happen 3 minutes into the game and it could be different depending on which champions the enemy has and which you have choosing out of a pool of 128 edit on a second note I don t want to fight over what is harder to play I just want to say that LoL isn t as easy as people might say it is
Oh wasn t trying to fight either Moreso trying to crusade why PvP is actually kinda fun
This comment was the second behind WoW but I think WoW is stressful for completely different reasons not gameplay EDIT is to was
Not anymore And Starcraft is the correct answer anyway All the others are objectively incorrect
I dont know games when you dont want to let teamates down are more stressful for me I dont care if I let myself down and lose a ladder game Being the last guy alive in csgo is pretty stressful compared to no one watching your ladder game
Well you get the same feeling if you are the Aceplayer in a Clanwar the way more intense gameplay
Implying you re in a clan
stress is an emotion there is no objectively correct or incorrect answer thats just your opinion
Starcraft is stressful but most stressful Shredder was a piece of shit when I was a kid in the tmnt games
Correct answer is Quake The game is really hard and makes sure to insult you when you fail In this game if you are slightly worse than your opponent you can end up with negative score This is how hardcore Quake is
God forbid you have a different opinion
If you have a different opinion you end up with negative score on Reddit
What is the algorithm for Sorted by Best Because that s my default sorting on reddit and with it the SC2 thread is in 18th place while clearly having the most comments and highest rating
Reposting earlier comment Best uses an algorithm that puts the comments first that got the fastest upvotes since they were posted like 1000 upvotes hour vs 800 upvotes hour but its not that simple It s better because with top whoever comments first will get the most upvotes most of the time because everyone sees the most upvoted ones and so better answers are hidden most of the time This explains it deeper if you are interested
Okay but whatever it is at least in this instance the result is not the best That s a little too extreme to have such a top comment so far down
Because it was posted a long time ago so if you come back to the thread a few hours later you see different answers the point of best If you want to change to the most upvoted ones choose top
You should read the article I linked It says that the top comments are always the ones posted the earliest so even if someone has a comment everyone would upvote it still wouldn t get to the top if it wasn t posted in the first few hours It doesn t matter who thinks what the name should be the reddit devs have named them What you are saying best is is actually top Just try it im 100 certain it will put that comment at the top and see that it has far more upvotes than the others
While I generally agree with this ranking I often wonder if we as a community adopt a mindset and approach to Starcraft that s completely unsuitable for improving and competing and fostering growth and instead more focused towards giving people ladder anxiety and encouraging people to turn to balance whining
How would you have us act differently to foster growth and healthy competition
Remember the backlash against Blizzard when they decided to add a clock to the game People were saying it was dumbing down the game because players could just memorize timings against the clock instead of going off the current supply of their build like how pros do it A fucking clock
Just look at the front page post people are angrily posting against the idea of having an indicator for queue d injects because they think it would dumb down the game Honestly there are probably people who think that they should go back to 12 unit maximum control groups eliminate worker rally points basically add complexity for the sake of FUCKING ADDING COMPLEXITY Starcraft complexity can be great but some people react VERY negatively to any attempts to simplify things that are needlessly complex or opaque
now that there is automining the games becomes much easier foreigners might actually have a chance
I can think of all manner of things that we should not do to foster a healthier community That s not very useful though because all it takes is a few bad apples who do do those things and it s ruined for everyone What I would like to know is what those of us who care can do proactively to foster a healthier SC2 community
Just my feeling towards your question Take it or leave it It s just the opinion of one person and it could be wrong This also got longer than I thought and sorry for my English I just recently came back to this sub because of lotv campaign posts I was religiously following sc2 and this sub for years Then at some time during HotS the passion went away Most of it was because of the toxic community The constant balance whine protoss bashing faceless Korean bullshit made me hate the community There is somehow a very elitist behavior in the community Like everyone knew everything best and the group of people who are target of the argument are just taking advantage of unfair things Only a few here were actually happy to help give information even in heated discussions Others just blamed shit on David Kim Interestingly enough that was the vast majority when I left mainly shitting all over Protoss knowing how OP they were by evidence apparently Meaning apparently the vast majority here actually plays in levels were all those little differences between the races actually made a difference Not like most here play bronze or silver league or something And that is my point The community is full of know it all better people who only get their knowledge from watching others play No problem with mostly taking joy of following the pro scene but don t engage in balance discussions in that way as if that is true for your level at all This problem can also be seen in the post that you usually see here when it is not off season almost exclusive to posts about the pro scene and shitposts Where are the posts about your own games Your actual contribution to the community Any tips guides and so on Even if you are not the best show us your game you enjoyed Your favorite moments These barely hapoen I know there are some but they are rare and even rarer from people from lower leagues I know those would get shat on Aaaand we re back to the elitist behavior of the community How dare you not being a broodwar bonjwa Let s shit on you you worthless piece of shit This sub community is so unwelcoming to bad players there is no fun in embracing it within this while being a bad player is apparently everything underneath top8 in masters There s even that oh so funny picture about what each step within the leagues means Like the other day the posted a gif barely killing a warp prism Although he tabbed away to macro at least twice many comments were ridiculing him for producing a bank because he supposedly focused too much to micro First of all he was macroing during the gif second of all you couldn t even see his minerals which he probably cropped out not to get comments about his bank and third of all so fucking what Why does it make this sub feel so much better being so negative about contribution of the basic player Let s play Let s contribute Let s share the fun It s a game not a dick contest to death It s so immature here I had to leave Now being back with lotv just having launched people still figuring stuff out and us being off season the sub currently is enjoyable I hope I can keep enjoying it I ve seen many good posts already and I hope to see more There still is Protoss bashing and of course poor Terrans whining but I noticed that any further explanation of why Protoss is broken today doesn t get upvoted anymore but gets downvoted I don t know if it is because the circlejerk wore out people played Protoss in the campaign and realized they have to do a couple more things than a moving or because now they learned that using spells can take some effort too or whatever But I like that Yes I play Protoss I fear though once the first tournaments are in the way people will get salty about their favorite race not making it far we will be back full force into an unbearable community Bronze leaguers whining about balance shitting all over the race that won recent tournaments and arguing with people that are trying to contribute Because some crafty Korean played his cards right on a level 95 of people here will never encounter And yes I realize there can be balance issues on lower levels than that But also you could have done something wrong For example trying to beat something the way the pro does it Also contributions from own games will be drowned by the 100st post of pros so there is no incentive for the inexperienced player however again Unless of course those who care take part in that part of the game the playing and making themselves and others enjoy the actual playing of the game Alone or together This sub is so large it s interesting how many calls for help on a matter get answered so little sometimes I know there are players that like to help I m not forgetting about those The problem with that it those are usually the really advanced players So although it is probably the correct answer to for example explain the perfect build order for that question this might not help the player in bronze Also linking to a vod of some pro or former pro How is that going to help How about you link a video of your own game Think about how much of a contribution this would be How involved you and the guy who asked would be All you have to do until platinum to fuck them up is macro properly really Really In his mind he s doing his best in that regard and still loses Now what A great contribution would be to do a tutorial on how to do that And link it I know that takes some effort But would be quite a contribution Be the hero of the hero of the noobs How about noob guide threads Not noob question threads Where everyone can make a post video in them explaining something they d like to focus on made for noobs Not going 200apm How about noob post threads in which noobs can post their games to get analyzed to get into the mentality of not shitting over any contribution that is below masters quality
It seems many of the replies to you are people in favor of reducing complexity I don t really much care about that one way another I personally find the game right now in a really good state Rather I don t think the community itself takes credit enough for things it does to help hurt the scene Examples Telling new players misleading elitist masochistic bullshit Ex This game is hard you re going to suck at it Be prepared to lose a lot before you grow an e penis as large as mine Overemphasizing winning instead of accepting losses as a necessary part Ex The best players find losing unacceptable Losing means you re terrible at the game Related to the above overemphasizing talent instead of emphasizing practice and regular improvement Ex Progamer X is so talented at the game clearly X was born with the ability and didn t practice for 8 hours a day for years to get to where his is I objectively don t have the macro micro needed to do this build Making arbitrary statements about the right way to play the game Ex You must play macro oriented macro is boring and real players are willing to cheese You must always play 1v1 and must play to win X play style is gimmicky Finally this is the one the community is the most self aware of but whining about balance which allows players to mentally excuse themselves for losing Disguising balance whining as a design complaint is IMO particularly disingenuous Unfortunately with the amounts of statistics out there it s too easy to cherrypick the data to find numbers to support your balance whine even though one will find that the larger the sample size you look at the more W L rates roughly equalize to 50 Anyone who has done sports or anything competitively minded knows that psychology mindset is huge and seemingly small things have huge effects both on the individual and the community
My experience is in music if you re in a bad mindset you re gonna play terribly
That s a pretty good list Wouldn t it be cool if we stickied something like this to the top of the subreddit
I completely agree we need to start emphasizing that its a game at the end of the day its supposed to be fun
Whenever lings run into my base and are killing all my shit I yell OH GOD THEY RE SWARMING LIKE BEES and that chills me out
One thing is who we empower hugely negative assholes like Avilo fuck I guess I just did it again and Idra or combatex get idolized in the community whereas more positive figures get marginalized or even indirectly pushed out of the scene day9 sob This encompasses how we interact with each other in game streams we watch and how we post on the internet I ve only watched two lotv games so far and both consisted of nobodies on ladder flaming pro streamers Like come on you know thousands of people will see you why be such a dick Especially when in real life most of those guys wouldn t even make eye contact
Starcraft really is a curse I m currently home with two children and when I put them to bed I should relax but as I love this game I go and play a couple of games before bed Then either two things happen I win most of my games I feel the rush and I go to bed with an happy face Or I lose most of my game feel how it s a waste of time and I tell myself that I should start to watch movies instead or at least play something more relaxing like Hearthstone which I hate But in any of these scenarios I m back the next night wasting my last hour s of the day feeling the rush knowing that I really should do something else
Life is play Life is love It is who we are
I ve gotten to the point where losing games isn t really a waste of time anymore What you do is go in with the mindset that losing games are beneficial and that you will learn more about the game and what you can do to improve than when you win games When you win you focus on I m so good DD instead of I won but I was supply blocked for 50 seconds
Just started playing SC2 again after a long time Played for like 2 months after launch and haven t played since I was super casual as well I have been getting into the competetive side and it really is stressful I have to get my gaming legs back because this game really is an emotional rollercoaster I think that s why it s so much fun though
the feeling when you win is worth the disappointment when you lose imo but yeah rollercoaster for sure
Yes bare 1on1 is stressful The rest is only stressful if you make it stressful for yourself
I think team games are pretty stressful when your ally opens with void rays and then blames you when he loses them all to marines I wouldn t say that s a thing I m doing to myself
If youre giving weight into your allies opinion yea that happens Either its a random ally and i dont care in the first place because hes just a random stranger whining and premade i dont mind about losing Well technically i dont mind about losing anyways if at all just in 1on1s
It gets stressful when there are alerts everywhere D
I turned off the sound 5 years ago It s much easier to focus
I should try that too Thanks D
One time in the WoL beta days I was focusing so hard as zerg one match that when the game ended I realized that I had lost almost all control of my mouse arm It was essentially just deadweight that I couldn t lift off the table One of the weirdest gaming experiences ever
well that s not anything new
I d imagine broodwar is more stressful than sc2 Not only it has same things which makes sc2 stressful but also is way more mechanically demanding But the most people upvoting probably have never played it
Maybe its the hostile ladder system we have no one wants to seem themselves at the bottom of their division and losing ladder points feels awful so its probably not only the gameplay but also the general ladder experience in general
Hopefully the Ladder rework will address some of this
Theres gonna be a ladder rework Woah
That is a problem Dota has as well though Working hard for like an hour for that 25 MMR and just getting crushed the next game and immediately losing those points again is super frustrating At least in SC2 I have my league secured
But the thing is in other games for the most part you see your progression so in starcraft its hard to feel like youre actually moving forward Not saying we have it the worst but the ladder i feel like is the most stressful part of starcraft as opposed to its game play like a lot of the times people dont care if they played bad just that they got the win and i think that translates best when we look at the gameplay and how a lot of players cheese for the easy win instead of practicing and getting better in the long game
BW was more difficult especially mechanically but SC2 is more stressful SC2 is much more fast paced than BW especially in LotV and also in SC2 a small mistake often tips the game from even to a loss Whereas BW games are much more determined by an accumulation of small advantages gained throughout the game Also in SC2 you have much less information about your opponent especially their army location In BW it s very rare to not know where your opponent s main force is and big armies travel much more slowly anyways And SC2 has much more build order and unit composition variety than BW The SC2 ladder design itself is pretty intimidating In SC1 you can do basically do whatever you want on ladder except use maphacks on ICCup you can make infinite accounts clear stats whenever you want only play games against one matchup on one map host games and kick everyone with a korean username Not that most people do any of those but SC2 ladder just have a very serious atmosphere in comparison
Yeah it s like CSGO being there despite 1 6 being a lot more stressful the game is silent except for gunfire which is a lot more stress inducing than the ambient sounds that GO has
1 6 was not played with competitive settings like CSGO is for the average player Same in BW there was a lot of high money or crazy gamemodes
You can play casual csgo with no stress whatsoever in the same way you could be a casual playing 1 6 People are saying the stress that comes from playing competitive is more than any other game when the stress levels in 1 6 were much higher due to the less casual atmosphere you play in
It was not more mechanically demanding sc2 has infinite skill ceiling in it s mechanics anyway Doesn t matter how good you are you can still get better
What Sorry but not having multiple building selection eased macro mechanics and not being able to select more than 12 units at a time I d say makes it more mechanically demanding from the start Am I not seeing something
No you are correct BW is objectively more mechanically demanding
If you want to do the same thing in both games it will be harder in BW That comparison is pretty pointless however since they re not the same game There s still an infinite amount of things you can improve on in Sc2
Yes you aren t You are comparing two infinities In a strict mathematical sense one infinity can be bigger than other but in real world for example in a game of starcraft there is no difference
Mechanical skill isn t infinite
Depends on the game in starcraft it is
It s very high but not infinite
Everybody who came from brood war can see that the skill ceiling mechanically is a lot lower what are you talking about That s why we don t have anyone dominating sc2 like we had people dominate Brood War and we never will have It was news when Flash JD Bisu or Stork outside a final in their prime lost a map to anyone not in that group I m afraid you re just wrong The improvement in results due to improving mechanics goes a long way further in Brood War before falling off Whilst there are always things to improve on improving them makes much less of a difference in sc2 than it did in Brood War Ergo Brood War was more mechanically demanding
Maybe you should go through the tournaments of bw and look at the results in brackets and group stages that should take your rose tinted glasses off It s always this exact same and wrong argument that artosis said in 2011 and now everyone keeps repeating it I even remember that article called elephant in a room in TL which turned out completely wrong as well All in all go check the facts before writing lies
It was news when Flash or JD lost maps in groups or brackets people went wild Kwanro upsets flash in the OSL type headlines because nobody expected Kwanro to take a map Just because it happened doesn t mean it wasn t a big deal in the community It was more of a big deal than Flash only losing 2 maps in the OSL he won in 2010 I think As for the skill ceiling I can draw qualitative graphs for you about what it s like if you don t understand what I m trying to say but I doubt you d take any notice because you re determined that your minority opinion is correct You re disagreeing with all of the Korean pros that changed over and a lot that never really did along with the foreign Brood War players that came to sc2 Incontrol Cloud Idra MorroW etc
have you played brood war
Looking at it that way it s hard to disagree with However looking at it realistically accomplishing the same amount of things in Sc2 is easier than it is in broodwar Sure they both have infinite skill ceilings but reaching identical levels simply does not require the same amount of effort I don t think
Well being no1 in the world still requires 12hrs of playing the game everyday both in bw and in sc2 In comparison in hearthstone you take the top deck of current meta and you are pretty much good to go
Well then again it could be that in sc2 with MBS control groups are more effective than their counterparts in broodwar so they are mandatory in multiplayer even more than in broodwar Using control groups makes everything much easier but learning the habit of using them is more essential in sc2 at the start than it is in broodwar
I mean it was probably more mechanically demanding in some sense just by being so fucking outdated but I do agree that both games have basically an infinite skill ceiling
SC2 has infinity skill ceiling So why haven t we seen a player who s significantly better than the others
Once after a 1v1 with my friend I started to gag because the match was so close
And here I went laddering to SC2 after being frustrated by Rocket League ranked
Personally I find that team games are much more stressful than one on one games such as Starcraft In a team game such as LoL you have five people relying on you to play up to standard and to be competent You have to rely on your team mates to play as well as they can trust them to make certain plays That stuff is stressful for me having to rely on other people In Starcraft everything is about you You get from the game exactly what you put into it How can you feel stressed out if you know exactly why you won the game or why you lost the game If you play perfectly you win If you make more mistakes than your opponent you lose There are much less variables to worry about in a 1v1 game than a 5v5 game
Starting a game of LoL gives me a ton of anxiety There s 9 other players and you don t know how good they ll be whether they ll let you down or you ll let them down It only takes one of those people to create a bad atmosphere Then with no replays and 9 other players to account for it s difficult to find out why you won or lost or what you could ve done better In Starcraft the ability to identify exactly why I lost and how I should improve removes a lot of the anxiety and makes me want to keep playing If you don t get too salty when you lose it s almost a win win scenario P
Very well said The fact that Starcraft makes learning from your mistakes so easy is something that translated into real life situations after a few years for me Being able to look at everything I do objectively and be able to make and accept criticism to improve myself in areas is something I can do at ease because of my time playing Starcraft
Yeah but you can t subconsciously blame your teammates if you lose a 1v1
Interesting how two Blizzard games are on top while they get bashed in their own forums for catering too much to the casual gamer
I think i forget to breath during games I always find myself taking deep breaths after a game is over
I never blink during games My eyes get really watery and tired But my mini map awareness has been improving
offtopic but why is a the sc2 comment with 3600 upvotes behind a comment with 170 and one with 750 upvotes
Are you sorting by top
Sorting by best and seeing the same thing as u sup son Still why is that
Best uses an algorithm that puts the comments first that got the fastest upvotes since they were posted like 1000 upvotes hour vs 800 upvotes hour but its not that simple It s better because with top whoever comments first will get the most upvotes most of the time because everyone sees the most upvoted ones and so better answers are hidden most of the time This explains it deeper if you are interested
It might not be how it works I ve read that article many months ago so I probably forgot a lot about it But it does count something like how many have seen it and voted on it IIRC Read it if you are interested
The thing is that Reddit s voting system uses a logarithmic scale meaning that the first vote will count for most the 2nd less and so on On a scale the first 10 votes will be equal to the next 100 votes which will be equal to the next 1000 and so on For reference you can see the source code of Reddit here with the relevant file here It s the algorithm in charge of sorting the rankings so that best posts are on top
ah you re right somehow the sorting in my settings was set to best recommended never looked at it
Good thing it has things like archon mode and unranked to take the stress out
Well yeah but that is only 1v1 I wish the fact that there is a lot more to do in sc2 than 1v1 is advertised better
i gave up on lol its just so random u either get good team mates or bad its all about it u can hardly change that
Meh I m an ex 1v1 master player that just plays casual coop computer matches custom and arcade games now It s only stressful if you feel that the only way to play the game is to ladder and stress out about it
I completely agree When I try to play standard I get extremely nervous thats why I try play more creative builds on ladder and not worry about losing
The only other game that get my heart racing as much as Starcraft 2 is iRacing

I tend to agree You can spend all game macroing your ass off only to make a mistake or take a semi bad engagement for 5 seconds and you lose Winning is quite rewarding though Overall the sense of improvement you get from this game is like no other but you cannot deny it is a lot of repetitive macro I find I can t play well when I m tired after a long day current diamond former master I m best when I m fresh usually in the morning after a cup of coffee
My problem with SC2 is that it feels like I m playing Speed Chess with chop sticks while my opponent gets to use his hands unless you have all the hot keys memorized and practiced to perfection you re most likely going to lose no matter what you do because your opponent is going to do everything faster
Have you tried the grid hotkey setup If you don t know a hotkey you just have to look down to the command card it is really helpful Also you can play all 3 races with it and the hotkeys are similar like probes and marines on q not s and e
I used to think that StarCraft was the most stressful game Then I started getting pretty high rank in Osu StarCraft doesn t make my hands shake nearly as much as having a full combo with good accuracy on a difficult song 15 seconds from the end in Osu Also in StarCraft you can take mini one second breathers while you re doing something repetitive like injecting If you lose focus for a second in Osu you lose your combo basically no questions asked I mean they re both stressful as hell But StarCraft is like a long drawn out stress fest while Osu is condensed stress into 1 5 4 minute bursts
I ve always felt League was more stressfull As soon as you accepted that you would lose around 50 of your games SCII became a lot less taxing Solo play in League isn t stressful because of losses it s stressful because you re 1 5th of the team and the team dynamic creates a lot of toxic situations I don t play either anymore but laddering in SCII always felt better than LoL Matches tend to be shorter as well That said in League you have dead moments where you kinda just let your character walk and do nothing while SCII requires more constant focus and planning
I m a diamond zerg and I used to play highstakes at poker I can confirm that SC2 is the closest to poker in term of adrenaline and stress It s pretty bad for the heart tho
Start getting fun from the game and consider that loses are better for you than wins and you ll stop being stressed Starcraft isn t easier to master than league it requires a totally different set of skills source was decently good at both games mid gm in sc2 and high elo in league

LoL is an extremely casual game that is designed for non gamers to play You shouldn t ever be able to take a 20 second break in any sort of competitive game The fact that people think Mobas are competitive confuses me You could go take a shit for 20 minutes and come back to a win screen in a moba
I kinda disagree SC2 is up there but any MOBA is far more mainly because you re depending on other people which raises the stress level SC2 is all on you
I think thats the reason its more stressfull with team mates you can blame on them while on SC you cant
I find it more stressful to be doing the right thing and losing because of something not in my control bad teammates than because I fucked up
Mobas are a lot more forgiving and much easier mechanically If you die or make a mistake you can still win the game pretty easily In SC2 the slightest of mistake can and will cost you the game
IMO mobas are a walk in the park I had been playing a bit of Heroes of the Storm and the most difficult hero Abathur is so relaxed and fun to play and no stressful at all map awareness is mandatory on him and I m actually surprised that my allies don t realize the enemy is taking some camps or there is an ambush waiting for them The only source of stress on them is when your own team is not in the same frequency as you and start doing things wrong mind me not different but wrong like thinking Leoric is like Murky
I mean Heroes of the Storm is the Mario Kart of MOBAs so I think it barely counts But indeed even a Dota2 or LoL is simpler on its own than SC2 but it takes a lot of strategy during the picking phase to make sure your team isn t countered and then a lot of teamplay
I played League too honestly I think Heroes have more things to consider inside the game merc camps bosses and the map objectives item builds on league are punishing to new people and require you to search for them before actually playing it it doesn t have a lot to do with the difficulty of the game other than that ganks and team fights are the same
please stop
rofl circle jerk has already been commenced here third time mentioned outside of this subreddit A L I V E G A E MsOs must be thinking that s weird I got my trophy where s the 100k
TL DR huge shocker
In other news grass is green
Yeah I know really surprised herO didn t get it
People overvalue winning blizzcon How did sOs have a better year than eg herO
A single 5 round knockout tournament determined his position
Well did her0 all kill KT
Well life was on fire 2 times this year the only other contender is Byul and sadly he didn t win anything when he was on fire Innovation i don t think there is a discussion there sOs hero and classic all contend for the title But sOs once again takes blizzcon and lets not forget his all kill
INnoVation only became a big shot again in Season 3 Where he found out only Rogue and ByuL were able to defeat mech He s a very skilled player true Maru Dominated in Season 1 with Life taking an SSL right of the bat During that time INnoVation was benched in PL Throughout Season 2 he proved us that he was still a champ contender And even during his relative Slump in Season 3 he managed to make it to the GSL round of 4 For me Maru should get the title Though I have to agree that either one of them could ve taken the title
The slump you mention with innovation is him not being the best and i do not see that as a slump
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they gave an award to Infiltration one of the few korean fighting games player over there It s nice to see kespa taking notice of that stuff
Just to clarify the award that Life Innovation and sOs are on together says Popularity award not necessarily best of XXX
If it s really based on popularity then I can t understand how sOs won over herO Not that sOs isn t popular clearly but I feel that herO has a far more likeable personality and has better showmanship
it doesn t have any details on the link OP posted but the articles I ve found says the Popularity Award category is fan voted
herO deserved protoss of the year IMO
Not saying you don t have a point but if I d won Blizzcon I d feel real hard done by if someone s telling me that someone else had a better year than me on my race
Yeah but herO has way more great results posted throughout the year Here s a list of their results where they placed 8th or better sOs best results 3 4th Place in GSL Season 2 3 4th Place in Dreamhack Stockholm 1st Place in MSI MGA 1st Place in WCS Global Finals herO s best results 3 4th Place in GSL Season 1 3 4th Place in SSL Season 2 3 4th Place in IEM Shenzhen 5 8th Place in IEM Taipei 5 8th Place in IEM World Championship 5 8th Place in WCS Global Finals 1st Place in Kespa Cup Season 1 1st Place in SSL Season 3 Granted sOs doesn t go to as many tournaments as herO but it s supposed to be best Protoss of the year not which Protoss ended the year strongest
I think you could also take Proleague into account in which both players were incredible but where sOs was more successful
We can look at code S results in 2015 which are a little funny sOs did not make the RO8 in season 1 herO did not make the RO8 in season 2 and neither made the RO8 in season 3 They also had the same Proleague record sOs was 27 16 herO 25 16 or 61 for both D Given relatively equal results makes sense to give the award to sOs imo but for objective observers it s more of a gray area
I m sure they also looked into offline records as well While I don t doubt herO being one of the best protoss if not the best mechanically his play style doesn t change very often If you watched proleauge throughout this entire year you see that herO simply out macro micro other people that has similar play style as the meta You can see how many players started to figure out gaps in herO s builds in the 3rd season for example herO vs Rogue in proleague I m not saying herO s not worthy of the title in fact if Kespa awarded him with it I d say it was well deserved but simply looking at a player s tournament results is not enough to determine how good of a player you are In herO s case while he doesnt have as many flaws as other protoss players his flaws are critical ones which makes it easy to be exploited
Where SidusKnight is confused is in believing the best protoss award should go to the protoss that had the most top 8 tournaments finishes The fact is that sOs did not participate in half as many of these tournaments and if you look at Code S and Proleague their performance was very similar with sOs coming out on top by obliterating his Blizzcon competition I think you d be hard pressed to find SC2 professionals and personalities that would argue herO is better
They look equal if we cherry pick and avoid the SSL and Kespa Cup sure
You said it yourself it s supposed to be best Protoss of the year Not which Protoss had more top 8 tournament finishes most of which sOs did not even participate in The reason why I mentioned Code S and Proleague is that they are the top levels of competition and here they performed relatively evenly with sOs emerging as king at Blizzcon You re focusing too much on herO s 5 8th placements which are decent but are hardly evidence that he s better than o
If that happened to me http i imgur com 6LoM4c7 gif
I think it s pretty close with Byul Maru and her0 depending on how much you value korean tournaments proleague results
Damn Life should wear a suit more often
SAUCE
sOs also won the best starcraft 2 player award and coach choi aka iloveoov got the award for best coach in starcraft 2
Life and Innovation is justified no doubt but the only thing sOs did 2015 was winning Blizzcon one good tournament run shouldnt win you the best player of the year award Imo herO or Classic should have won the title
Eh I think Parting or Hero deserved it more than sOs
If you had just won blizzcon the finals of the entire freakin year and someone else got the protoss of the year over you how would you feel Shit is the answer
Isn t it supposed to be all of 2015 not just the end
Blizzcon also rewards the entire year with its qualifiers and probably gather the best players in their best form
yes but if you got to blizzcon your were top 16 in the year already and then winning it
sOs did won blizzcon and he did all killed in the star league when he was needed
Innovation was the best Terran only in the last 3 months i think Maru is the best Terran in 2015
You can also turn that around Maru was the best terran only in the first 3 months of this year I think Innovation is the best Terran in 2015
Maru was the best in like 6 months
Maru didn t win GSL
He won Starleague
And then was inconsistent for the rest of the year
And then was inconsistent for the rest of the year
He was really really terrible in round 4 of proleague which doesn t equate to being inconsistent for 9 months while finishing 2nd in WCS points He finished top 12 in all 3 seasons of GSL and SSL while Innovation didn t even qualify for the main event of SSL season 1 2 I m fine with Innovation being the best Terran of 2015 but inconsistent isn t the word i would use for Maru
I suppose you could just say overall innovation was more consistent and a higher threat in general Edit this isn t to say Maru is bad or anything he is undoubtedly the second best Terran of 2015 but I just don t think he quite touches inno Maru is also so sick to watch
Inno was inconsistent more
No that s untrue Inno was a monster in proleague the entire year Just because Maru plays a flashy style doesn t make him better Not to mention last time they meet it was an Inno stomp
Flash forever best Terran
Flash is just bad in sc2
Dark Innovation Zest
Nnnnyouuuupppee
Deal with it Dark s mechanics put Life s to shame Only reason Life does well is people can t figure out that play style
too bad wins actually matter
They do but I was talking about skill
you re such a dumbass
Have fun in plat
Oh you guys
so better skill means less wins lol
Dark is the god of ZvT ZvZ ok but not good in ZvP
Proof
Lmao Dark Life What a jokeSeriously though the campaign void rays are soooooooooo fucking powerful They turned the last few missions on brutal into a cake walk
have you tried massing DT s with their jumping blink attack ninja shit
Why use those when you can have DTs that never die Use them and the regenerating zealots and just A move everywhere without thinking
You can t die if you killed all your enemies No need for sissy dts
Immortal DT s are insane for defending but ninja DT s are overall better units
The regen zealots do a lot less damage though they re nice but id rather have units with some punch behind them
I used those DT s myself until I found that after they re warped back to the Dark Shrine they have a cooldown before they can die again So not quite infinite DT s but it was damn close
Didn t use them in campaign Massed immortals with anti air skill well until alarak gave me the void rays But damn vorazun s dts make minced meat of anything The skill also attacks burrowed lurkers not sure if it hits cloaked ground
But then the flying detector showed up and I got sad
they do so much burst damage with their first attack detection doesn t even matter o
Same with the Taldarim version of the Immortal that has some sort of artillery from hell AOE barrage as a standard attack A dozen of those things just shit on absolutely anything on the ground even in Brutal Couple that with the extra range when charged Voidrays and everything just melts in seconds
The Tal Darim Immortals seriously had me questioning if I should even make Colossi
I never made a single collosus or reaver during the campaign still have to beat last 3 on brutal tho Every mission was gateway comp with a couple immortals or vrs
Purifier Colossi is good for point defence but yeah never really use em
They can t 1 shot anything what flies though except 3rd tier and overlords Nerazim Immortals are better for that
Who needs anti air if you have Void Rays with your army
No one but you can t always mass void rays
Duh Why do you think it s called Legacy of the Void ray
good one Void rays are the way to win easily D
Huh I went with Carriers They just refuse to die between the auto heal from the Spear and their science vessel tagalongs
On brutal I tried carriers at first and failed Changed to Void rays and it was much easier
For the last mission That one I went Dark Archon collossus I tried carriers but ultimately I just couldnt kill everything fast enough The carriers themselves were fine but I couldnt melt the waves of small units coming through Collossi basically end the masses of small ground units which is the vast majority of the enemy forces and stealing the Golden Armada is just amazing
For that mission I favored void rays and corsairs The corsairs kept the stuff on the ground alive while the invaders sat in the vaporization queue
Oh I didn t think of that Mind controlling all the golden armada would be a sweet idea I m going to try this
Repair carierrs with the chain voidrays 2ez
No no to be fair you do need to include one of the sentries I think it s the purifier tech Whichever one gives 2 range Then you have 8 range void rays and everything dies
Then it charge up and become 11 range void haha
Ah true I m still not quite done with the campaign I only got voids yesterday so I did get the 3 range effect but haven t used it much yet
Oh my what Is that how that charge up worked lol I didn t really understand That s hilarious 11 range void rays
Isn t the chain void better
You d think so but the AoE is actually terribad Like can t kill zerglings bad
it looks cool though it has that edgy tal darim style
So edgy
Tal darim protoss edgelords You know they listen to korn and slipnot
If you have enough it s good I think getting to critical mass is key I did last mission on brutal with them
Nope somehow the good void rays end up more powerful I thought at first that the tal darim void rays pwned but as it turned out the chain effect is pretty weak and much more so against enemies with heavy armor Also the tal darim void rays don t seem to charge up nearly as crazy as the normal void rays do
As I understand it they don t charge up at all Not in the same way that normal voidrays do What Tal darim voidrays get is a longer chain when charged that s it No charged damage Which is really what you want
Exactly the beam does not get more powerful as it charges Whereas the vanilla void rays get a longer range and stronger beam
Void Rays OP
Broscience meets starcraft haha
Shhh you ll get it banned
Haha that video is brilliant I ve seen quite some of your content but somehow missed this one
The real question is do Void Rays counter Void Rays
linking your own unfunny video sad
Sorry man tried to link your super funny video but I couldn t find it

CAMPAIGN SPOILER personaly i believe that voidrays arent the best unit in the campaign Dark archons are way more usefull not only do they do aoe dmg but you can take controll of your enemys units i played the last mission of the campaign only with gateways and the Robo and stargate that are there from the beginning i overtook carriers and tempest and guardiens and build cannons werever i could not be at the moment worked out great while voidrays would lose me the game in the last 5 because the ground units had nothing to attack but the Keyston
Nah just build pylons and cyber cores they just can t help themselves
sure i took the ones that rebuild themselfs too becaause they hold out longer but still they just die to quickly against 50 dragoons I played on brutal btw that plays into the zealots dieying fast thing
DAs aren t able to mind control hybrids because they are heroic and ultras because they are frenzied This turned me off from using them I d rather have storm that heals my units
You also can t take over void shades So any mission with a lot of those might be better go with something else
yeah but you realy dont need hybrids or ultras the tempest you can take over realy kill them easy and the carriers kill the rest while the archons make sure nothing walks by and kills your allys buildings or the keystone
I used mass void rays and in the end I just force fielded the zealot and immortals out
Corsairs are the true OP units They mess up the AI of everything on the ground and evaporate everything in the air Add couple Tal Immortals or DT s to the mix and you can a move anything
Saying what units are in the game isn t really a spoiler now is it
Wait there s a game
Spoiler alert Not cool man
Some people do want a surprise
void rays void rays gotta max up my void rays
If were talking campaign the most powerful unit oddly enough is actually the Corsair Try making a ball of them for the final mission and it becomes a cakewalk whether you back them up with DT s Carriers Voidrays Doesn t matter cause the enemy can t even attack back But yeah Voidrays forever OP lol
This Disruption web is on autocast And it has a cooldown instead of energy What the fuck I didn t even lose a single Nexus on Brutal
Me neither and I used them instead of photons
Destroyer Void Rays specifically
Freaking Void Ray Muta ball basically
Don t know about you guys but I have a feeling i have read this somewhere before Edit 5 days ago
I LITERALLY THOUGHT THE SAME THING WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA p s this is how I beat the level first go on brutal
SO MANY BANELINGS
Yep I had the exact same thought when I read that one as well
To be fair I LOVE spamming Voidrays
I think you are confusing power with power ease of use
Silly me I made arbiters instead
Sprinkle some red sentries below and go for an EZ win Similarly the Mastery achievements should be called Void Ray achievements or DT achievements
I personally enjoyed the never ending blink train Blink shield regen become invulnerable for 5 seconds at critical health That is just a recipe for never ending blink stalkers I ended up just a moving then around at the end cause I couldn t even give half a fuck
Have you forgotten about vipers
How is an army of Vipers supposed to win you a game
Of course pure vipers won t win you games but their AoE against air is very effective against mass void rays Add a few of those to your army and your anti air becomes much stronger But I just realized that this is the loading screen for the last campaign mission
ahh I fundamentally misunderstood you I guess you could say the same about Liberators
Not vs mass zealots
Apparently you haven t played the Campaign
Try it on Salvation Brutal
Okay on any mission where the fact that they cant body block things isnt a negative
That s what corsairs are for
How to win salvation on Brutal 20 corsairs 40 voidrays Put them together on Patrol Come back after 20 minutes and enjoy your win
Funk that I d rather have fun
ravager
maxed Liberators man
Ultralisks
terran stuff
It s true I don t even know why I bothered with Arbiters in the first place
pls they get shredded against a critical mass of liberators
In which mission in the campaign do you face a critical mass of liberators
The whole Wings of Liberator campaign
It s an incomplete sentence The most powerful army is made from a variety of units that can cover each other s weaknesses given that you are up against an opponent with a similar income rate who may attack you at any point See I am fun at partiesThis is sick Terran one plz
Do you have a specific picture in mind
Jimmy in the bar watching TV
Hmm I can do that but I don t see any good ones with a decent resolution I m at work at the moment If you have a link with your resolution I should be able to do it
From work too I see 2 decent pictures Battlecruiser Classic Terran I love your work by the way Even if I hate Protoss I d love to have your original wallpaper on my screen
You and me both it was the only image that seemed to fit perfectly I m Terran as well so I m going to be looking into making one for Terran as well The battlecruiser one is easy because I can use that planet for the hoverover images The marines image is tough don t really see any option for the changing images
When you do make one be sure to post it a I m anxious to see what you can come up with b I am a terran and want a terran RM too
No problem if I get around to it not sure how resource heavy it d be but I d love to try to do 1 for each race since I have 3 monitors
Hey guys found a website with a few pics in 1080
Every image I try to open shows it s a broken image Are they working for you
Working for me try proxying through it it might be becasue of your ISP
Could you maybe re upload to imgur
Here you go friend Nice work btw D
Awesome will probably try the first one with the 3 monitors so when I hover over Battle Net it can show multiple games same with steam
Well done mate
A few people are asking what I used It s called Rainmeter Here are the links for anyone who have used it before RMSkin File See if this works for you here is the rmskin package http www filedropper com sc2lotv10 Background Triple Monitor http i imgur com fO67GwL jpg Background LOTV Image http i imgur com vQWLI9G jpg Layers http imgur com a y6b8H Honeycomb Icons http imgur com a zMIoX CPU monitors http flyinghyrax deviantart com art CircuitousTwo 376652231 Honeycomb GGL http xdiabeetus deviantart com art Honeycomb Glorious Game Launcher Example 548266891 Trashcan top left http lilshizzy deviantart com art Rainmeter Simple Media 1 1 212678796
How do make the background transition into other background when you hover an icon Is the transition something that is defined in Rainmeter or something you have done before you loaded it into Rainmeter
You can download packages for Rainmeter I linked Honeycomb GGL that s what I used You will need to edit the ini files in there It will come with Firefox I believe but if you open the ini in wordpad you can change the information needed
I feel bad for asking you here but I ve installed Rainmeter 3 3 and when I try to run the application nothing happens I ve reinstalled I m not sure what the issue is here also I couldn t find their troubleshooting section on their website
I m sorry I wish I knew I don t have too much knowledge in the program as I just started about a week ago You may want to try r rainmeter very supportive
Thank you very much I ll check it out when I get home
Is there anything like this you d recommend for mac users
Unfortunately I have no idea Sorry
Hey man is there any way you can upload the Rainmeter skin I d love to have this on my PC
What do you mean I posted all of the layers and background I used It s those with the Honeycomb GGL add on
Yeah I saw on another part of the thread about a rmskin package if you go to your RM manager and select your files for the skin and click Create rmskin package it should produce a pack that you can upload and that we can unpackage directly into our pc
Ahhh never knew that Ok I will do that tonight then and post it
See if this works for you here is the rmskin package http www filedropper com sc2lotv10
Thanks I ll need a few more hours to get home and test it out and I ll get back to you
You could try geektool
Yes Build a PC
downloaded the RMSkin package and imported it but when i select it as a layout nothing happens when i try loading the skins individually they do not show either strange anyone got experience with this Would love this setup for my machine D
You have Rainmeter installed and setup I m not too familiar with using a RMSkin because I just made it from scratch but in your documents folder you should have a RM folder Do you see all the layers and images in there If so in the RM settings window do you see the folders on the left
How It s fucking beautiful
It s called Rainmeter It s free to use Took me about 2 days to make this one Let me know if you need any help
I should really give a try to rainmeter btw nice work
Thanks it s my second one and I love it
You wouldn t happen to know if its a resource hog
So far I have not seen any significant resource drag The gif shows the CPU and RAM monitors and the only reason they were as high as they were was from the screen capture program
Rainmetere uses very little
Can you share this with us so that we can import it into rainmeter D
Here is where I posted it on the subreddit with all the layers icons https www reddit com r Rainmeter comments 3txvds starcraft ii lotv setup
Did you share it at reddit gaming do it
One upvote isn t enough this is brilliant
Thank you
Really nice work I spent hours learning rainmeter and making a fancy desktop like this and it only lasted a few weeks before switched it back to something simple How mine looks now
Yeah I had a similar experience it looks really cool at first but you quickly get bored or annoyed with it and want something less distracting
Just how organized your desk is and tidy it makes me want to get some wall mounts
That was just for the picture Usually it is littered with beer bottles and candy wrappers
Yea I tried to keep mine simple as well My first one was all over the place as I was still learning it
I better zoon out of and show my whole lame setup instead of simple using a screen grab
I was at work when I posted and that was the only pic I had saved
Why is there Jaina Proudmore
The icons on the bottom are for my applications When I hover over the Battle Net loader it s for my Blizzard games I didn t want it to only show 1 since I play all of them I will add a Heroes image soon too
As someone who installed windows 10 last night THIS IS THE KINDA SHIT YOU CAN DO
Rainmeter has been around for a while pretty sure it works for Windows 7 as well
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
No need it s free It s called Rainmeter if you want to look it up
Thanks
So if I want this how do I get it running on my pc And can it run on win7
I posted it on the Rainmeter subreddit with all the layers icons wallpaper and tools I used I believe it should work on Win7 https www reddit com r Rainmeter comments 3txvds starcraft ii lotv setup If you have any questions on how let me know and I can help
Hey great post I haven t played with rainmeter in a while could you briefly explain how to set the layers Thanks I believe I need a background ini based on your ini files for the icons but I m not sure how to script the background ini
Ohh I see That makes sense why is it firefox for the Chrome ini and not Rainmeter
I just copy pasted the Firefox files over and over for each app I don t think that line actually does anything and was just too lazy to change it
Sorry one last question nothing seems to be coming up when I try to load the ini files in Honeycomb GGL for example BattleNet ini Am I missing a step where I have to place the files in a certain directory I did change the path in the background ini
When you look in the Honeycomb folders I had one for each program Skype BNet Chrome etc Inside each folder should be a ini and a background folder with a background ini and the image I want to see when I hover over Do you have that Inside the first ini be sure to the folder names match whatever the name of the folder your in if you changed from mine Also be sure to change the path of your program to where the exe is installed on your PC Inside the background ini be sure the name of the image is spelled correctly if you changed from mine I do believe capitalization matters not sure though
Oops sorry for spam I m not sure what I did or what happened but it s working now LOL Thanks again I do have one more question though xD how did you do your cutouts specifically getting it to align properly with the planet
Like as in how did I make them Just take whatever image you want as your background and use Photoshop I used the lasso tool to basically crop out anything I want to be on top of the background over the images when I hover over Hope that makes sense
Can you release it it looks awesome
No problem I appreciate it I put a comment in here with everything I used If you have any questions on how let me know and I can help
Great thanks
Amazing job man Would this work for multi monitors
Definitely I have triple monitors but only used the features on my middle one The other 2 are just static images of Terran and Zerg logos However you could go through multiple monitors
Very nice job Rainmeter is the best
Why is Crystal Maiden Jaina Proudmore in it
The icons on the bottom are for my applications When I hover over the Battle Net loader it s for my Blizzard games I didn t want it to only show 1 since I play all of them I will add a Heroes image soon too
Does this ruin performance Or not really
I do not see any crazy increase at all In the gif I have meters for my CPU and RAM and the only reason they were high was for the screen capture I was running
Hrm so CPU usage stays low This is awesome I ll definitely check it out
You sir are amazing Excellent work
Good job Thanks for sharing
Hey there you seem friendly and super responsive So allow me to capitalize on that I have a 2 monitor setup at home and then separate from that a laptop dock that plugs into a 3rd monitor AND one of the first two we just mentioned So left mid laptop dock mid right desktop In addition to all of that my X box is also plugged into that center screen Because of this setup my needs are constantly changing When I m working from home the laptop gets 2 screens When I m playing a PC game the desktop gets 2 When I m on the x box it s using the mid and I ve got the desktop on the right And finally the question Does Rainmeter have the capability to adjust for the above situations on the fly Ie I set up 3 different configurations and based on what s plugged in and turned on Rainmeter can adapt Or would I need to manually switch between layouts And if I need to go manual is there a way to build that switch somehow into the layout itself like clicking on use subreddit style for example Alternately can it be hotkeyed Thanks
While I m still new with Rainmeter so I don t have a definite answer I think the answer is a yes and no The reason I say that Rainmeter does have the ability to load different options However I don t think it has the ability to auto change when you change your inputs You d have to go into the Rainmeter settings and change your profile to whatever you re switching to I d recommending going to the r Rainmeter subreddit and there is a design thread for questions just like these EDIT Link to the design thread https www reddit com r Rainmeter comments 3ttuxx weekly design advice thread
Right on thanks so much for the reply
Is this entirely customizable I m a huge protoss fan and love this idea I have some custom ideas for it that I d like to impliment into Rainmeter to make this how I d like it Thank you and amazing job
Definitely everything you see either photoshopped or downloaded as an add on so to speak What are your ideas that you have so I know what you re trying to do and see
I have some protoss wallpapers already saved on my computer and thought of instead of the planet in the background placing the wallpaper I have on it The wallpaper is a black chrome protoss symbol wallpaper ill post it here when I get home if you d like currently at school
I have the images that show up on the planet reflect what program I m hovering over So Steam shows CSGO Battle Net loader shows SC2 and HS I m also going to make a Heroes one as well Are you saying you want the planet to show your various wallpapers instead That would work too
Well I d keep the different wallpapers depending on the icon im hovering over but on the main page replace the planet with the protoss symbol Its more of a brain idea that might not look so well when it s actually made and put out I d still like to work with it and see what I could do
Good luck be sure to post what you make
I certaintly will Thanks for showing me this
Holy cow Nice work Looks like I m checking out Rainmeter today
Thanks have fun with it
Empty your Recycle Bin Great job btw
Lol thanks Yea it has my original wallpaper and files I used plus random stuff I cleared it once I finished this wallpaper
the day they ll merge rainmeter with chrome will be a turning point for humanity I rarely see my desktop nowadays That s the main reason I uninstalled it
But there s only 3 lord of the ring movies Love the wallpaper though
I as so confused for a while until I realized you were going off the LOTV abbreviation
Everytime I see LOTV I immediately think of Lord of the Rings
Holy shit you are fantastic at what you do buddy
Thanks awesome to hear that
Why does it keep showing Jaina
The icons on the bottom are for my applications if I click on one it opens that app The one I hover over is for my Battle Net loader I play all the Blizzard games so I have it randomly show SC2 and Hearthstone I m going to make a Heroes one soon as well
Oh cool Thanks
Awesome
Thank you
I downloaded the CPU monitors but it gives me a rmskin file that gives me errors every time I try opening it Did you run into that
Hmm nope did you install the file from the website It should add it to the Rainmeter application or just hit refresh all on the bottom left It should now be a folder Expand the folders and load the ini file associated
I just downloaded it from the deviantart page Tried refreshing all from the rainmeter icon but it doesn t show up as a new folder Hm
That s insanely beautiful
Thanks think I should photoshop a MSC into it j k
How did you do that I want that
How can I install these Buttons
It s an add on called Honeycomb GGL http imgur com a zMIoX Click download on the top right assuming you have Rainmeter installed already and it will install itself You will now see it in the folders within Rainmeter
This is very nice
this is so sick
Why is there a random jana
The icon I hover over is for my Battle Net loader I play all the games so it shows SC2 as well as Hearthstone
This is pretty cool Does anyone know if interactive wallpapers are a thing in Mac OS
Not sure sorry
How can I download it And can you make one in 1440p
Just google Rainmeter and you will find it It s a free program to use The program supports any resolution size so you can definitely make one in 1440
Aw crap now I need to go home and make a crap load of SC themed wallpapers
That is so cool I want to try making a zerg one
Definitely It s a free program so it can t hurt
I m attempting to do it now Its interesting but I really am bad at this
Let me know if you have any questions
It didn t work I couldn t get the hang of it but thanks for the offer
Not a problem I m here to help if you want it
Is this a glitch in the matrix This was on top yesterday what is this bullshit
Seeing how I made it myself and posted it today calling bullshit on you
sorry didn t want to diss you or your work was just confused lolSnute is a tremendous asset having him is a big step in mapping out the LotV meta Dreamhack is awesome as always
Snute expert hype
how come he isn t playing
he didn t qualify
BibleThump
How was group D drafted Seems like those players should be split into the other groups
Didn t see until now what a group of death that was
Agreed group D looks way tougher than the other groups
Bit strange to see Nathanias as panel host rather than caster Otherwise cool lineup
Nathanias reached a state where he can do anything he wants just like other big figures such as Apollo Artosis Day9 and Tasteless Well deserved
they did that already last DH It was kinda weird but also super fun
Really I must have forgotten that
No WaxAngel as expert Also here s to your customary nervous smile uptalk half stuttering and How do you feel for winning this important match random quaestions courtesy of our charming Smix
I guess Huk will provide us with the Protoss insight once he loses
So after the finals he will provide insight thedream
Yeah probably since his group is not easy and there are no terrans there It seems like he has a rather great PvT
No ForGG
Didn t he retire because he was the only Korean player to actually lose consistently to foreigners
I m pretty sure he didn t retire He is the most consistent SC2 streamer and has been for some time I would think that he would stop streaming if he retired
Having a guy snute that s considerably better than a lot of the participants in the tournament as an expert seem rather funny
Anyone know how much these casters would make in the weekend Just curious
I have a friend that used to work for Dreamhack up until the beginning of this year He told me the casters make anywhere from about 1500 on the low end Nathanias up to 7000 on the high end Tasteless Artosis for the weekend This is in addition to travel and loding costs being covered These were the numbers and names he gave me and while it was still in HoTs could be higher for Legacy Edit Low end did NOT imply good or bad it was just the cheapest caster fee
I don t know how the best caster outside of Korea got labeled with low end but ok
Someone said back in the day Nathanias sold his body and talents for a very low price so maybe that just remained the norm for him
Low end didn t mean good or bad just cheapest
Nobody from the public really knows
Hell yeah smix 3
Sad to see no iNControL
fuck off from Snute D
As someone who is interested in both wow and sc2 this title was very misleading
As someone who looks for talent in the booths and not the casting desk I was also mislead
Smix is alive O O The last time we saw her was in DH tours in May this year
I ve seen her doing some CS GO hosting at least at one of their majors recently
Still not long enough ago tho
flo strange choice
flo has been obsing WCS NA and co obsing with funka on WCS Finals and co obsed with funka during blizzcon how is it a strange choice
ah I didn t know that I hadn t heard from her since thorzain played in WoL or so assumed she s moved on
her and funka are very talented but different styles one notable thing is during player intros flo zooms in while funka zooms out and then the way they bring attention to things with their mouse is slightly different they also use the same gear out of sheer coincidence https twitter com flosc2 status 583928742461988864
Talent Wouldn t that be the players
I am not sure I am assuming they mean the talented people whose talents are not gaming at this event I think they will call the players the players I could be wrong though
It it a thing in broadcasting the commentators are called the talent and the guests players are the subjects
Snute wins GPL and decides to not compete in DH Is he transitioning out as a competitor or is there another reason
This is no DH Open He also did compete but lost in the Qualifiers
He lost the first Qualifier but he didn t have time for the other ones because of family stuff https twitter com LiquidSnute status 655742503614816256 Kinda sad that they invited a semipro instead of probably one the best foreigners with Lilbow atm
Not enough games to really say who is the best foreigner at the moment different people are dominating different places
Snute won the only big offline tournament so far which also had Flash Jaedong and Lilbow in it so objectively he should be considered best outside of Korea
it was an invitational with very few players that was part of the celebration of lotv launch in china A tournamen with more people where anyone that wanted to enter is a way better indication and under that he lost the first qualifier for Dreamhack in the first round to sortof and lost immediately after to a terran Lillekanin that i ve never heard before being better than JD and IAsonu doesn t tell us much
That s why i wrote probably
there also was 1 foreigner invite spot but it was given to Huk instead
He just won 15k so I guess he just wants to take it easy
no he did compete in qualifiers but lost in one and wasnt able to attand the other
Glad to have Snute there either way not like he is stopped competing
No Rotterdam Shame not the have one of the top Casters
No incontrol wtf
Good
Why He s great at DH events
I cannot stand incontrol He is by far my least favorite caster personalityThe player on the account who claimed to be Terran player Jin responded to the name Apocalypse when messaged Lol
I dont get it is that the proof if I were matchfixing under a false nickname I would obviously respond to every other nickname than my own
No i think that means he responded to his own real name
Or and hear me out here or someone could be lying about their name GASP
hum how is that proof of anything again if I were to matchfix under a false persona I would respond to basically any name other than my own or ignore a few names and then accidentally respond to some random name just to make sure people would suspect someone else
He didn t matchfix under a false name he aproached Alicia during a GSL qualifier as himself The Jin thing is because he tried to play in Olimoleague under a smurf after he was banned I really don t believe what he did was matchfixing at all unless he directly asked Alicia to throw a match or talk to gamblers I think it was a naiive mistake and he just gave away contact info
It s not really hard proof by itself but he was asked to prove his identity or forfeit and he chose to forfeit This combined with the fact that he responded to apoc as if it was his name means the current theory is that it s apoc trying to get around his ban
Hey guys here is the PSISTORM statement on Apocalypse as of a few days ago Obviously there is new information coming out all the time but we are still sifting through everything and wont be making other statements until we have https twitter com KarlJayG status 667750900082065409
Are you guys releasing him
So all the proof there is is a confusing bnet chat log
He tried to help Sleep cheat his way into my tournament via the ladder qualifier as well I ve heard other stories but I can only confirm for my own personal story that he tried to cheat the ladder to let a friend in
Destiny II whenever you re ready
Rifkin mentioned banning Apoc from all his tournaments as well but never elaborated on it He mentioned it awhile ago in a cast
Speaking of this tournament Will there be a Destiny II
He said he has to look into it but if he does it will be a live event
oh fuck yeah midwest live tourney I ll be there
Doubt that it would be in the Midwest That s kinda asking for failure imo If your gonna have a live event it kinda has to be in CA
East coast not viable
More than Midwest less than CA
I thought it was Gamja and not Sleep
Just curious if DIMAGA tried to enter one of your tournaments would you let him
I couldn t find anything after a brief search about Dimaga and match fixing Care to enlighten me or give me a link to check out
http www teamliquid net forum tsl 2 107745 dqs dimaga reason sarens vasilisk He was wintrading with himself to get higher in a ladder qualifier pretty much the same thing as Destiny says Apoc has done with Gamja it wasn t sleep He got a 12 month ban from TL amongst bans from other organisers I quite like DIMAGA and don t hold it against him but Destiny was talking about Apoc never being welcome at any future tournaments he runs and I was wondering if he d be uniform in his judgement
Did you even read the Olimoleague statement He was banned from Olimoleague for contacting Alicia about match fixing GSL and then pretended to be a Chinese player Jin in the Olimoleague qualifiers and was found out
wow such witchhunt much drama wow
If this was r dota2 this thread would be at 500 points by now
Excuse me but you are underestimating the love for drama us dota 2 players have It would have AT LEAST TWICE that ammount then again dota2 is not a dead game so
Say that to the Franfurt Major crowd
jeez it s a joke
There may potentially be language barrier From what Apocalypse has told me was that he would get paid money only to talk to Alicia for him This guy came to Apocalypse as a potential sponsor but instead used him to contact other Koreans Anything is possible but Apoc has been one of the nicest people I have ever met and thinks the best of everyone I could see how he could be manipulated into doing something because of this I really hope it isn t true he has been a really good friend of mine
I played him once in a online qualifier he came off as extremely nice I really hope this isn t true
I decided to cast with a friend one tournament just for fun no one would reply to us not one person except apocalypse not only that but he let us cast him until he lost I believe you when you say how nice this guy is
just because someone is nice doesnt absolve them from any responsibility or guilt of wrong doing You can be nice and do wrong things
No but it gives you a perspective of a persons morality And unless there is clean cut evidence that s pretty much all you got to go on So I d say it s kinda important
the screen shot admitting to match fixing and then using fake names to play isnt evidence
I was just talking in general But to me it looks like he just contacted Alicia about match fixing not actually match fixing himself I m not sure what to make of the statement tho but there is something odd going on that s for sure
there s no proof that it was him using fake names there are plenty of other players it could have been and responding to a random name when trying to imitate someone else isn t proof of anything also he never admitted to match fixing he only stated that he was supposed to be paid to talk to alicia for the match fixer the rest of his chat log is not conclusive of anything as it is in broken english and he even says in the log but for sure now I didn t play match fixing
I never said otherwise
Yeah he was an incredibly nice person Never had any issues with him and overall very helpful
Fair explanation I thought it was weird aswell He obviously had been manipulated
Also based on that screen shot and influence from other people he was disqualified from the HSC qualifier while it was underway
If someone pays you to create contacts this is more than 1000 redsigns
Like I said Apocalypse doesn t expect anything bad from almost anyone
ok and that absolves him of responsibility and guilt how exactly
being manipulated to do wrong wihtouth knowing you are doing wrong odesn t make him innocent but gives him at least a chance to appeal and not sully his image
On September 5th 2015 during OlimoLeague 38 a person claiming to be the Chinese Terran player Jin participated in the bracket When investigated further by the admins he was in fact a Korean player but provided several different names He was asked to provide proof he was either Jin or one of the Korean players he claimed he was but instead chose to forfeit It was later determined that player was Apocalypse The player on the account who claimed to be Terran player Jin responded to the name Apocalypse when messaged This more than definitve proof
Proof of what It s proof that he tried to play even though he knew he wasn t allowed Not proof of any matchfixing which is totally the wrong word for what he did We don t know what was said to alicia it could just have been hey these guys want to contact you here s their number which is not matchfixing at all It s not matchfixing unless it actually implies that he knows what they want to do hey these guys want to fix a game here s their number if you re interested It s perfectly understandable if he was acutally mislead by these guys I don t think the punishment is too unreasonable but people are gonna hate him forever if this isn t cleared up I asked rifkin if he can elaborate because at the moment we have no idea what was actually said
Not even proof of him trying to play either just that a suspicious player responded when a message was sent to him with apocalypse in it
if you think thats definitive proof i feel bad for you How was it determined that it was apocalypse just because he responded when messaged So fucking what I dont mind them banning him from their tournaments its theirs and they can do whatever they want to it But to declare with certainty that it was apocalypse smurfing based on this alone is extremely negligent
Also look at the time stamps He was banned after the 34th olimoleage and tried to participate under a smurf on the 38th That statement is not evidence at all The only thing to go off of is the chat log which looks like a lot of miscommunication
He is not saying it is a quality argument He very well laid out his point
You know the power of Reddit could save him
Couldn t make much of the b net chat
Apparently not only Olimoleague https twitter com Rif kingz status 668643613593612288
Let s correct this He wasn t banned from participating he was disqualified after already playing part of the tournament because someone on the backend sent that screen shot to the folks at TaKeTV
https docs google com spreadsheets d 18gkLKlQpIVM97fvlsGJevd02rDZ89VlNOeqzHvuy2xo edit gid 0 update
Matchfixing is the wrong word it strongly implies that he threw games for money which he didn t do We need to know exactly what was said to Alicia if he was asking him to throw a game that s matchfixing if he was passing on contact info to people who then asked Alicia to matchfix it s a naiive mistake Don t ruin a guy s career by calling him a matchfixer unless it s very clear that he approached someone and it was him trying to fix a match
You guys really don t see the bnet chat as proof I always lose qualifier and they just dissappear Seems pretty cut and dry to me
The allegation seems a little strange why would he try and involve another player in match fixing Couldn t he just pocket money himself and throw games I ve never had a problem with Apoc in all the tournaments i ve run over 5 years Nor to my knowledge has any OSC partnered tournament organiser Those who know him also seem to say it would be very out of character Not really seeing a lot of definitive proof either Money transfers replays direct statements from those involved etc I think cool heads should prevail don t instant ban him especially if your event or region has no association with those involved Let people look into it See what truth comes out Innocent until proven guilty If he is guilty yeah fair enough should be punished
The other player is the link to the betters
Just confirming this Chinese player Jin is not just a typo of jim the much better known player
Well Jim is protoss Apoc is terran If Jim was playing as terran it would definitely be suspicious So they are likely correct in saying Jin
Sounds like he said he match fixed but they didn t pay him so it doesn t really count as match fixing XD
I was watching during that tournament I always wondered why that guy was booted He was playing phenomenally as a terran player Crazy what goes on behind the scenes
We don t need more match fixers in sc2
According to the statement Apoc admitted approaching another player with the attempt to matchfix If that s true then let the Banhammer fall hard
Has Olimoleague contacted KeSPA and Afreeca about this Not that it would necessarily do anything but
They wouldn t give a shit about this You need a proper criminal investigation in Korea for this sort of thing and a different tournament that isn t in Korea wouldn t have any bearing on their banning or allowing any specific player from events Afreeca also don t care honestly they were told they should really ban the people who match fixed recently and Savior but they never did so why would they ban a guy who fucked with a foreign tournament
grab your pitchforks boys
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Well rip his career time to go to army
He was never really good to begin with Actually I was surprised he got picked up by as many teams he did According to some pros he was very nice but he was never a tournament winner and other than being GM on Korea he didn t show much promise otherwise for being the next big player
You are overlooking how useful solid practice partners are in competitve gaming It s way better to have someone like Apoc to practice with than practicing against players like Inno TY or Flash Apoc has no vested interest there s little risk of playing against him in a tournament and he s such a nice guy that he ll probably practice endlessly with you until you get whatever you re focussing on completely down
removed
is this true if so we could get another thread goingPvP is now blinklings and baneruptors
I miss the lazerbeam giraffes
I dont At least this has 2 units to micro
If zerg speaking do you want to argue with me on how clever it is to mass mutas and dedicate 100 of your attention and mechanics to it
Really I couldn t be happier to be done with them
I know I got an awesome purifier skin for a unit I can t use anymore
I love it 0 3
It s horrible Open up with oracle expand with mothership and voids immortal and cloaked cannons to defend those blink attacks You need surprisingly few units to defend with when you have a good position in your base and a mothership warped in cloaking everything and an oracle threatening Use stasis traps too
The visuals are really bad i had to watch 5 times to understand that it was friendly fire I though there was a glitch and the distrupter shots were invisible
OH It s friendly fire I couldn t see that for the life of me thanks for pointing it out lol
wowow this actually can happen fk
THE POWER OF PROTOSS
protoss too used to t clicking a move
You are thinking of stim a moveing terran That is why you put the extra T in your post
Grid setup T to attack move
t click a move storm attack move on a standard setup
Not really Storms need to be casted upon an area besides using different control keys for templars or they will go walk right into the terran army
Never commented on the validity of what he said I just explained it
your comment is invalid Protoss only uses 1 hotkey
I use between 5 and 6 just for units
Truth is here
worst terrans ever
Is protoss the only race capable of fucking themself this hard
Nope
Wow MK now that blunder vs ByuL seems more believable as a legit mistake than matchfixing now hahaha
I think manual fire of widow mines onto your own troops works too
Ah yeah and raven bomb That too Maybe not as bad as disruptor but still painful
Can you please explain this reference D
OMG does F2 select the Disruptor projectile
Yes it definetely does
Hahaha
rip
Wow that is a pretty good reason to never use it
That and the select every worker I have part
F2 doesn t do that it s just army units
Select idle workers is actually useful
That one is yes For some reason I though f2 got your workers too
This needs to be fixed I m glad I never use f2
Yeah i thought so too but luckily i play Terran I do offrace as protoss sometimes which is the reason i know this
He boxed them
Yes I boxed them
Does it Anyone O
Yes it does
Yes it does
Yes it does
glhf
thats pretty stupid design
dont use f2
Doesn t negate the comment They added a button that is detrimental for a player to use That s stupid
Hm It s a button with up and down sides which you just have to know how to use Seems normal to me
you can attack your own units with almost anything doesn t mean you should
1 Missclick 1 fast GG
The only realistic reply on here
this wasn t even a miss click he just F2 ed everything
no he didn t there s a disruptor at the top who doesn t follow the other units he just boxed
Will f2 select the cast object though That wouldn t make much sense
It does

Crap should ve checked Well that s 22 MB well spent
Thank you so much In a world where webm and gifv exist why would anyone still make a gif is beyond me
Just so you know gifv webm D
Cam someone ELI5 Im familiar with hots units and the general game info but what unit or spells is doing this
Protoss has a unit that deploys a controllable blast unit It does area damage and is controllable like a normal unit It appears that this player shot them out then pulled his army back with the select all hot key not realizing it would select the bombs as well and then they blew up his army
You forgot the name of the unit p Thank you though
Disruptor I haven t had a chance to use them for anything but drops on mineral lines or defensive moves when trying to retreat
Disruptor friendly fire The red toss triggered them and then kept them in his army hence killing his stalkers
luckily the disruptors are LOTV units not hots
It might help to realize that this is Legacy of the Void not HOTS anymore
Which is why he asked the question Familiar with HOTS but not LOTV Should have been obvious
I realize that I have not purchased or played it yet so I m asking for the information I m missing Is that not obvious Why did you even leave this comment to help nobody
lollllllll i love how you kids downvoted me because you think it was an unhelpful comment literally hilarious to me it was OBVIOUS that you were talking about a different game sorryyy i was trying to steer you in the right direction shit I thought it was obvious when you said ELI5 that you didn t even know it was an expac you know cause you said ELI5 word to the wise don t ask for help then be a shit head when you misinterpret information doesn t make people want to give you help in the future

Thanks for the 22mb gif jerk
Too many games end this way
Oh god I just threw up a little bit
So did I
I do that annoyingly regularly
un bind f2 it will fuck you for about a week and then you will play better than you ever have
I can t understand how Protoss players can even play with F2 binded Observers just fly everywhere
All races get fucked by f2 really Z and T tend to have marines lings at the enemy s future bases and watchtowers Only situation I would use F2 is if i was going to pull the boys
but it doesn t include workers
He knows that Think about it
Pull the boys You know this means workers as well right
Keep thinking you re almost there I m sure
i know f2 is why you always get dropped by terrens because all your observers are just with your army
Wait am I supposed to have detection
I never actually used the All army hotkey
Rebinding f2 f4 to camera controls was one of the best things I ve ever done in Starcraft
Do people actually use F2 I blow up my army with Disruptors by accidentally boxing them
The guy in the gif wasn t using it and it s unlikely that the guy you replied to is either You just can t box your units to move them back while the projectile is on its way out
thats why i made my all army key ctrl p something ridiculously hard to press and requires both hands so i only use it when i REALLY need it like finding lost units
This isn t strictly because of F2 If you re disruptor is shooting its ball then it can t move If then you select the disruptor and try to move it you ll end up moving the ball instead FYI
Nothing but respect for you to post your own hilarious blunder Play on soldier
I ve been seeing a lot of people mentioning f2 Do real players actually use this garbage What happened to multiple army hotkeys
I m master league I rebound my F2 to the 3 key because F2 is a pain in the ass to hit Pro players use it too just sparingly It s silly to unbind it It s a useful tool
I was high masters for a long time and had gm mmr for a season or two I ve never once hit that key I can t imagine there s any reason for a protoss to ever use it
Helps find that lost observer before that WM in your mineral line has fired 4 times
To which my question is Why wasn t the observer hotkeyed and more importantly why do widow mines even exist
Mistake or some people run out of hotkeys with the 6 spellcasters they have in their army and dunno respectively
Fair point on the spellcaster thing that s why I liked WoL better
forgg uses it a lot
Pretty sure most good players still use control groups I had someone try to convince me a few weeks ago that most pros use F2 lol
most pros do use f2 just not all the time mostly control groups are better but there are quite a few times when f2 is really useful and i ve seen loads of pros use it for example rain at blizzcon
Is this the new Hybrid settings It looks really ugly now
Not sure about the settings in this gif but I am using Hybrid 3 0 and it s amazing Very clear and bright compared to the normal low settings
r chobomicro
Yeah cant say how many times I ve done that try to micro army and accidentally select the bomb and poof GG
https www reddit com r chobomicro
how to get those invisible stalkers Kappa
Integrating the new units into your play style can be hard to figure out Keep practicing 420SWS Gambit I believe in you
If the disruptor do friendly damage does the ravager does too
Yes it does
TIL that the Disruptor do Friendly fire
it doesn t hurt other allied disruptors though
I use F2 TT
Yep me every other game with disruptors basically
Can someone tell me what happened here Haven t played LotV yet
the Select all army units key is a bitch
HAHAHAHAHAHAAH that s the best thing I have seen all day
rottimicro
Weird I ve not been using it for that reason
This is the epitome of F2 A Move Protossing
OMG this is sooo funny
FeelsBadMan
protoss getting used to friendly fire maybe zerg will have friendly fire one day aswell oh wait there s no expansion left to try out such drastic measures
Storm does friendly fire captain
oh really like does it kill as much of terran as of the toss itself its not really significant plus it was the only ff unit of toss not to mention zerg compare to the number of ff units spells of terran and dont even try to argue that almost all of the terran aoe units are ff xcept for hellion myb and almost all of the toss zerg aoe units are non ff xcept for those mentioned captain
Micro Protoss
Sweet justice Finally some punishment for bad control and 1a syndrome
Disruptor probs Done this a bunch but the fact that it fires even if I select a target halfway across the map Dafuq blizz Why does this one say eff it to target range It s like if HT just fired storms if you click too far instead of moving to the target range
It s a projectile skill shot not a ground targeting ability Like adept shade vs fungal growth
I see but the shade doesn t cause damage and isn t all the adept has to offer I guess with disrupts I would still prefer to at least have a marked radius so I can move the unit within range to use the only attack it has
your solution would come in handy in some situations bur overall would not work well for that unit
that s why it has a helpful radius indicated when you select the unit it s pretty simple don t fire the shot unless then enemy is within that radius
For minor engagements yeah sit back and pop one off Any kind of intense engagement and I lose site of that instantly Also disclaimer I only had seven seasons in SC2 total so I m disgruntled about feeling like I m back to square one with LotV T T
Protoss Thin k s
F2 F2 F2 F2 the reason why i dont build disruptors KappaRoss
He boxed that F2 would have grabbed the disruptor at the top in the end
