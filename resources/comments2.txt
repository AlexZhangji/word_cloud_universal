Except we can t beat Spurs Like ever
Neither can Swansea
yeah well
Zac would be a Swansea fan
because he s pretty but struggling of late
Same back at you With love not really Man Utd
I got your back bro
This year only one team has beaten Spurs Even United needed an OG to do it
Yep Here s a list of scorers of winning goals against Spurs in the prem this season Kyle Walker
Always rated him
Wenger did in fact almost sign him
United didn t beat Spurs Kyle Walker did
If Walker had not scored Rooney would have
Rooney looked like he had a bad case of buck fever in that instance Much like Kane did last Sunday
It s less fun when you think of it that way
To be fair the only reason Walker ended up scoring is because Rooney bottled it
Man of the match he was I was hoping he would hit top form that game too haha
And everyone can beat Villa
Almost everyone
sadly
I mean we ve beaten everyone else since our return Both us and Tottenham have had a mix of managers And yet no matter what we seem to do we just can t beat them I m not hopeful the December match this year either
We ll probably go 2 0 up but end as a draw
Maybe though you re apparently more confident in our team s ability to go 2 up against any team right now
I always get super nervous against Southampton since you guys are usually tearing it up at the time but for whatever reason we seem to pull the win or tie out of no where at times Usually great games though well at least in my biased opinion haha
I think two or three times in the last couple of season we ve been 2 0 up against you guys at half time then Christian Eriksen just decides to tear us apart in the second half and you guys win 3 2
Or that one season of Adebeyor going nuts in his first game back under Sherwood Basically his only bit of form in years and it gets him two goals against us
It was nice feeling the way Spurs might have felt when Elia went nuts and scored two away against Newcastle last season
Yeah fuck Newcastle and that Krul game
Yeah just go God mode for one game and all is well We d been on a good run against Newcastle at that point too
I think we seem to beat you and Swansea a lot as your good footballing sides like we are but also not quite as good as us So you don t sit deep you actually have a go at us That weird thing where you tend to struggle more against as worse side who are just happy to take a draw It s like how united used to just always beat us
This season it is definitely you doing the tearing up
tie Spotted the American
spoiler alert there s more than one
Wait non English people watch footy as well
Haha true I hadn t even noticed I actually usually do say draw interestingly enough

And we can t beat fucking Norwich such is life
Newcastle Norwich was 6 2 sorry to be that guy
FUCK
Sorry Love your work though
I preferred his earlier stuff it s too commercial now
Did you actually make this Saw it earlier on today on another site
These things get made around this time every year Someone else could ve made one as well
Well at least I didn t have to be that guy
That game broke my heart
That game partially mended mine only for it to be repeatedly shattered afterwards
Business as usual as a Newcastle supporter then
Should say where anybody can beat Chelsea
except Arsenal
And us
In fairness we can t beat anyone
Bournemouth
Oh do fuck off
Fuck injuries
After 13 games I m starting to think the only word to describe us is that we re Fucked
Chin up Tamworth is only 9 points from the top
You think you re special We lose every week
Looking forward to this weekend but will be sitting in the home end as the away end sold out
Actually says Where nobody can beat Leicester Except Arsenal
Not saying we would ve won but to be fair Mike Dean fucked us over e Lol no idea why I m in the negative now Hell I don t get r soccer sometimes the officiating that match was dreadful and even Chelsea fans can admit that
You guys always say that
Every team s fanbase blames the refs on a regular basis hardly an Arsenal exclusive phenomenon Did you even watch that match It was a very unusual case
I was joking I forgot how sensitive it gets in here sometimes I remember Mike Dean fucking over many teams to be fair I didn t catch that specific match but did see the outrage afterwards My cousin supports arsenal and after every loss he blames the ref no matter what It s quite funny
Your cousin must have hated you for joining Manchester United
Nah its all good he got him an Xbox
Yeah well
Never expected to see Dan s thumbs on r soccer
Is this from Ninja Sex Party
This ninja
No this one NSFW
Isn t Juventus having a pretty poor start to their campaign as well
They started out absolutely abysmally Chelsea esque but have recently been kicking things up and are in the 6 spot after beating Milan last Saturday
Leicester have still only lost once and they went into the lead in that game mad
The best team they didn t lose to was Tottenham and they drew them The best team they ve beaten is West Ham 2 1 The next month will be telling for this team
Pretty good considering our defence let in 14 goals in the first 7 games Thank god for the rest of the team making us score
Like Liverpool 2013 14
But Leicester Could win the league
In fairness them being in the league doesn t add much as they where behind in a load of games Spurs have also only lost once
What about when not being fair
For La Liga 12 games played Sporting beat Malaga beat Deportivo beat Rayo beat Palmas beat Sociedad beat Sevilla beat Getafe beat Levante beat Villarreal beat Atletico beat Eibar beat Granada beat Bilbao beat Valencia beat Celta beat Barca beat Real beat Espanyol beat Betis beat Sporting There is nothing special about this specific cycle there are 3657 such cycles for La Liga Havent written code for EPL You can find the code here http pastebin com QdRvfwRv You will need to modify the arrays if you want it to work for the different leagues EDIT Coded it for EPL There are 144 such chains for EPL A different example for EPL Bournemouth beat West Ham beat Newcastle beat Norwich beat Swansea beat United beat Tottenham beat Sunderland beat Crystal Palace beat Liverpool beat City beat Everton beat West Brom beat Arsenal beat Leicester beat Watford beat Stoke beat Southampton beat Chelsea beat Aston Villa beat Bournemouth
without a circly picture I won t believe you
The circlier the truthier
Which is to say if anyone can beat anyone La Liga is more competitive
Yeah this means nothing Example circles for La Liga Serie A
Without pictured badges and fancy slogan I won t believe you
Damnit man I m a software engineer not a graphic designer
Not with that attitude
And now do Bundesli oh well Bayern
The Internet being the Internet
Graphviz
graphviz is where it s at
Damn right it is I don t usually get to see my computer science and football worlds intersect so neatly
La Liga Where anybody can beat anybody
The irony that this is more true for La Liga when this infographic was meant to defend the EPL s recent poor form in Europe is pretty funny
And in all 144 Leicester will be next to Arsenal and Spurs will be next to ManU
For what it s worth here s the version with the corrected scores http imgur com JzpajZe Edit Correcterer scores
Did you use an algorithm to find this path or was your work manual Edit I was bored so I spent a little bit of time writing a Java app to brute force it Here s all the combinations of which 144 exist at the moment They all start on Stoke but being circular you d get the same results ultimately no matter where you started Edit 2 OP s combination is on line 43 Edit 3 Tried to do the same for Bundesliga And well Can t because Bayern
Shouldn t be too hard to do manually it s quite closely defined by the fact that Villa and Bournemouth have only won one game each and Tottenham and Leicester have only lost one After that there aren t too many decisions to make
not to mention a better render of our logo good good good
lol logo
ELI5
the answer we were looking for was badge or crest
We all know what he meant but it s badge
Is it still a badge if there is no shield
Get ready for the Sport bible to steal this without credit
I remember this was the case during the 13 14 season as well and it turned into a very good season entertainment wise so hopefully it s the same here
It feels like this one has already started to top 13 14
It s shaping up quite similar 4 5 teams at the top of the table with only a couple of points separating them the champions faltering badly and a team at the bottom who everyone has nailed down as relegated but a new manager could bring some hope
Hope What s this magical hope you re talking of
He was talking about Chelsea
I don t know I m being nice to Villa it must be this damn Christmas spirit of mine
I hope some of our opposition have some Christmas spirit and gift us three points soon I m looking at you Watford
I hope Scrooge takes away your points for Christmas
You need a heart transplant for being nice to the Seals and a brain transplant for thinking they have a hope
Yeah but I don t think Chelsea will fire Mourinho
Obviously I m a biased Liverpool fan but 13 14 was ridiculous Suarez had one of the best years that I ve ever seen from any footballer Yaya Toure was at his peak devastating bullying best Mourinho blew his chances of winning the league in his first year back at Chelsea with conservative tactics Tactics Tim had that beautiful gilet and weird salute thing with Adebayor Fulham hired a crazy guy and Moyes ruined Man U Crazy season This season is good so far though even if Liverpool have been mostly bad
We got Klopp that s the best part of this season
13 14 a good season depends on the perspective I guess
We only lost 2 0 to City not 3
Oh man seems I have a real problem reading and copying Apologies
It feels good that we only fit in this because of a very unfortunate own goal
we only lost 3 1 to Southampton
Ugh I had the results written out right in front of me as I made it and I still ballsed it up Apologies
Literally a cicrlejerk
This graphic for new r soccer logo
BPL is the most entertaining league Great density at the top great international players and teams with lots of tradition still being at the top Downsides are the atmosphere in the stadium and the lack of homegrown talent EDIT for some reason I like Stoke
In reference to your latter point lack of homegrown talent that s one of the reasons it s been so exciting to follow Spurs lately It s a shame that it does seem so rare but hopefully with investment in academies we ll see such things become more common
convert him Convert Him CONVERT HIM RUMMENIGGER THE SPURS SUPPORTER
Sod off We don t have many foreign supporters we need all the ones we ve got
Give the paperwork on that Messi transfer some time and you ll be good
Well not too much time otherwise our fax machine might start having problems
Go Stoke
Everyone s a Stoke fan when they want to downplay Messi or Barcelona
I ll fight you for him
I was really sad that I didn t name myself Rummenigga
it s ok we got u
Uhhh autocomplete
All of ours are injured
EDIT for some reason I like Stoke Top lad Most of the atmospheres are decent really its the top teams with their day trippers who struggle
EDIT for some reason I like Stoke All the right reasons
For some reason continentals think when we say it s the best league it means the highest quality teams when it s only because it s the most exciting even if the quality isn t as high
It might still be if you account for the entire table
Atmospheres at the big clubs maybe
Just wait till next year and your move into a bowl stadium
That s when we become a big club you heard it here first domalino
Atmosphere at West Ham has been slowly dying for years Doubt there will ever be a game like the Ipswich play offs again which is kind of sad
I was at the home leg of the Ipswich game and I have a season ticket this year and I disagree Think that s an odd game to pick because there have been better games since beating Chelsea a few weeks ago was about as good as any game I ve been to Even Everton in the cup last year with less than 30 000 fans there Every Tottenham game
Ya the top teams have superstars are fun to watch and are prone to playing like shit every third or 4th week so the other sides aren t completely out of it
Stoke
wouldn t you be able to do this in any league with no undefeated teams
Not necessarily no If you have teams that have only beaten the same teams for example it gets tricky Also only 13 games in to a season is quite early however in that crazy 13 14 season it only took 10 games
Oh ok thanks for clarifying that up
No worries Also it was made trickier by the fact Leicester have only lost one Tottenham have only lost one and Aston Villa have only won one so their positions were fixed in the circle next to Arsenal Man U and Bournemouth respectively
Not necessarily because it s possible a league has two teams who have only lost once each but both to the same team You wouldn t be able to do a circle if that were the case
Where everybody is kinda not really good and everyone will watch the UCL semis from their comfy couch
The whole anybody can beat anybody thing is true of every league in the world and I still don t understand why people only ever say it about the Premier League like they re unique or something Even in supposed one two horse race leagues like La Liga the juggernaut teams almost always lose a couple of games a season to teams they shouldn t be losing to
Because big teams lose to small teams very often that hardly happens in la liga and especially the bundesliga Although it does happen from time to time it s just a lot more uncommon Plus imagine barca bayern or madrid in the position chelsea is in right now Quite literally impossible But not saying the competitiveness of the league is the sole reason for the bad form but it does contribute
Plus imagine barca bayern or madrid in the position chelsea is in right now Quite literally impossible on the other hand could you imagine Chelsea or city or united sinking into mediocrity like AC Milan did in serie A
You mean like we did 5 6 years ago Doesn t happen often I grant you but it still happens
Something like Chelsea is literally happening for the first time in the Prem it s a bit silly to infer anything from it It s exceptional Well except for Dortmund last season I guess
How fast are people forgetting United under Moyes
Moyes United wasn t nearly as bad as Chelsea were in their first 12 or so games this season
No but other aspects of their respective declines are similar
That s because the big teams in Bayern Madrid and Barca are better and more consistent than the teams fighting for the title in the EPL
True u Al Gala needs to give us an infographic of upset frequency to really measure the stratification of the top leagues
Marketing
I feel like The Circle of Life should be playing in the background There s even a lion with a crown on its head
I got you https youtu be VxTQKxyJyxw
Fuckin hell norwich scored 2 goals against newcastle amazing up front Just the back was the problem
I remember that one time Villa won a match What a day
Any particular reason why you made the scores on the bottom half as if they were away wins I am not moaning about it just found it very confusing
I tried to make it so the team s score was closest to their logo I m graphically challenged though and didn t know how best to put it on the thing
Here is the one from 13 14 season http i imgur com oGtMJF2 jpg I personally find that way easier I could not imagine any kind of layout with scorelines in there either tough task
Yeah I did that one too tried to step it up with scores this time haha
Ah I was wondering since you mentioned that in your other comment here Really challenging design with the scorelines I will see if I can come up with something as well
I actually hadn t seen it as Elinaeri did although of course that is the standard football naming convention Scores closest to the logo made sense to me
Maybe as a cyclical human centipede
Can someone make one of these for the 03 04 season
Look at how much we suck look at our top teams failing week in week out That must mean the league is more competitive s
Football Feed on facebook have nicked your post
Well technically it s after 106 games played
I m glad we could do our part with our one win against Bournemouth
I ll believe that when we beat Palace
A Condorcet circle The cool thing about Condorcet circles is that you can delete all of the results from all of the matches involved in the circle and get the same rankings The thing is though that this is probably not the only Condorcet circle in the EPL this season
I am not sure but I don t think this holds true if the teams are separated by goal difference
Right only zero sum results Disregard the scores

Where anybody can beat anybody Except Villa Villa can only beat Bournemouth
this is really cool
Awfully kind of Villa to only win one game this year to give our content creators somewhere to start
Giggled at Liverpool beating Stoke 1 0 thinking about last year and all
Do this for the 2003 04 season
urgh probably the only team to lose to sunderland Most depressing night this season
I will see if I can come up with scores this time haha AhC
Ah ok that went over my head P
I think he does often play as a right back he s right footed
Let s talk about facts
Credit to our lord and savior Omar
Bbbbbbbbbbbbbale
Marcelo Azevedo
where did Koscielny play before I thought he had been a centre back since the beginning of his career at Guingamp Tours Lorient
idk lol it all happened so fast
wow does anyone have a gif of Ward s skill to get around kaboul just now i think it was an elastico or nutmeg too quick to tell
after triumphantly turning into Diamond Palace last match v Liverpool I fully expect Palace to play like Tin Palace and go 0 2 down against Sunderland today within 20 minutes
Maybe Sarfaraz Ahmed 48 off 46 and Misbah 68 off 72 to win that match against SL in dying light in Jan 2014 Also definitely Sehwag 83 off 68 v England he turned a draw into a win Finally Sarwan and Chanderpaul chatting 418 v Aus in 2003
Apparently pontus wernbloom and Cheick Tiot
Is there not a rule in place that prevents loanees from playing against their parent club
Ah ok
That pass to Arnautovic was class don t know who did it tho
City 3 0 Liverpool
alt f4 is a shortcut on pc to immediately close all active Windows
Are Maxim and Pantilimon unfit
yeah I think it s Buffon Barzagli Chiellini Bonucci Darmian Florenzi Soriano Marchisio El Shaarawy Eder Pell
nice thanks for the threadDamn number 66 is not looking good today
That s Marcio Azevedo i really don t know why he s at Shakhtar or how he s been doing but he was average to shit in Brazil
But he always had 5 Star skills on FIFA
he has 4 get your shit together
He had 5 in FIFA 12
i am aware always had not sound weird to anyone else tho plus he wasn t even on fut 14 and 15
Fifa 12 13 legend
Probably has a very good agent
Most big teams get the world class brazillian talent Shakhtar ends up mostly with average ones Jadson Douglas Costa and William are probably exceptions
Not really most of their offensive buys were once a great prospect here Bernard did extremely well in Brazil and won Libertadores with Atletico Fred was bought early in his Internacional career but he was already highly rated Taison was great at Internacional where he also won the Libertadores Wellington Nem who hasn t been playing also did quite well at Fluminense and was considered a young prospect in Brazil Alex Teixeira was as highy rated as Coutinho in the beginning of their career at Vasco Then you have Fernandinho Douglas Costa Jadson Willian The average players they get are defenders like Marcio Azevedo and Ismaily
I am actually brazillian too but now living in Spain I know the trajetory of most of the players you mentioned and we have to be honest there is a reason a lot of talented players dont suceed or arent as great as they look the brazillian league isnt on a high level for something about 10 12 years most of the talent ends up being not even close to world class when they come to Europe
me and every other brazilian fan might agree that the league isn t nowhere near as it once was but still those players were good young prospects once if they turn out to be world class or not that s another thing

That was the most hardman nutmeg and lob combination i ve ever seen Awesome
Dani is a warrior It s criminal that Danilo has started over him
He looks like he spends his spare time lumberjacking
What a goal from a right back with his weak foot
dani and luka scoring in the same match i m not crying you re crying
Ronaldo with a goal and two assists
Assist of the year right there
it s almost as good as busquet s assist
Master playmaker Anderson
Hans J rg Butt is the real deal
I m a fan of Tom Carroll s assist to Bale
that is beautiful Robben was certainly lucky to have a guy like Butt helping him to get on the scoresheet
I miss him
He s OUR Anderson now
Prefer this one from Xavi
HAHAHAHA Klopp
Busquet will remind that for the rest of his life He will tell his grandsons about that one for sure
Exquisite passing
here go
Savage
this is a real madrid post get that barcelona trash out of here
you see those men in white
Well real madrid are in the gif
This one too mate http youtu be yWVrolNQ4RU
Still bummed out about last weekend
I don t think he s a Madrid fan
Talk about being bitter lol
Why is this the top comment
Still managed to miss few chances
Decoy90 Okay so where s the real banter
No banter whatsoever I m glad he s back in form but he can be even better
He s just scored again lol But I don t believe he s back in form
Exactly how I feel It s going great for him but it doesn t feel like he s in top form I mean it s two assists and two goals can t be much better on paper but there is room for improvement
Can he even get back to form his knee problem isn t gonna go away with playing more lol
That is an excellent goal
Azevedo still living off his Fifa 13 self because it s clearly not working out for him irl
hahaha 5 skills
Where are the people saying Carvajal isnt offensive
Sweet nutmeg but surely that shove would be a foul right
Best goal of the night for me
Carvajal Danilo
Carvajal is just as good attacking as he is at defending Danilo is just as bad attacking as he is defending
what a goal
Has to be a starter this guy
What a rough game number 66 is having Also great goal from carvajal
What s with the recent explosionin the number of fullback goals
Fullback envy sweeping Europe
I love how he just nutmegs him and as the defender is trying to recover he just shoves him to the side
Isn t that a foul on 66
That was unexpected
hnnng fucking awesome
Yasss
nice curl
I can t tell if that was a cross or a shot Still a sexy goal regardless
Am I the only one for whom none of the streamable links are working right now
Why was the camera so zoomed in Thought it was a replay at first
The Shakhtar defenders find new ways to be crap for each goal
Does anyone have a normal angle Absolutely hate that let s zoom in on one player crap
Carvajal going James on this one
Jesus chris what a belter
What exactly is a belter supposed to mean I always assumed it meant fast hard and direct
yea that wasn t a belter by any means
Goalazo
What a cross
Ronaldo must be pissed at that
deleted
huh
I m surprised to see Ronaldo do those fakes I ve heard that he hasn t done many dribbling tricks recently Or is that just talking about 5 star skill type stuff
He hasn t done any skill to put a defender behind in like i don t even know Those fakes he does them every day
OK I don t really watch Madrid games I d rather not stay up until 5am for a game that isn t Arsenal the Socceroos or a World Cup finalSorry man I know you want to praise your defender but if Sterling put that on target either to Buffon s left or right that would have gone in It was a terrible miss from Sterling no defending could have saved you there

Felix Brych is such a terrible referee woeful calls all across the game Edit Every fucking year as well God fucking damnit
What A Goal
Anybody have any idea what s going on with Hart
Feeling a red card coming The players are getting fed up with it all
Unable to go back since I m relying on other people s streams Normally I would be able to go back into the match to grab that for you but now tonight Sorry mate
Cross was by Alex Sandro

Maybe try selecting a role for him in that position that s what I do So instead of CM Playing position select CM Central Midfielder That s what I do when I want to re train my player and it seems to help
He s still at United in 2018 in my save Getting decent amount of apps but not a key player United did buy Kane in their first season so they play him instead
Getting no yellows is pretty difficult thing to do Your players will make tactical fouls and or lose their head and make rash challenges It s pretty much impossible to not get carded at least once in a game
Can I see your squad I m currently playing with Gent and I m only in 2018 so I m still struggling a bit
Get Zabaleta
HOLY SHIT BOYS THEY DID IT Belgium is proud of you
Pretty fucking stupid that two four steps are guarded
That first minute red card though
Probably Pardew
Fuck I didn t get Bolasie s skill that lost him the ball in itSorry i just went off of what the article said not very knowledgable about Sweden Thanks for correcting that
Thats actually an awesome picture thanks for posting it
After they see how he handles Messi and Neymar at the Euros they will definitely sign him
3978 miles to go see Belgium in a friendly against the US in Cleveland Ohio Well worth it
Jelle Vossen from Burnley to Club Brugge is comfirmed Signed a 5 year contract
LvG s Notes
Ghost corner in Belgian first division game
How about Vidic s double tackle
Belgium put up their tent in Cyprus box hopefully some goals follow real soon here Starting to look like shooting practice out there
De Bruyne Gotze Kagawa
Robot Celebration
Same goes for The Netherlands sometimes they are referred to as just Holland while this is technically not the whole of The Netherlands It would be the same as referring to Great Britain s team as England
I like it but using Fellaini next De Bruyne feels funny to me In the future we d have Thorgan Musonda Jr or Praet for that spot Not that I rate them that highly but just seems like a position better fit for them
I agree with your future midfield line up In 4 6 years Tielemans Malanda Musinda would ve been a massive midfield Kind of like Witsel Fellaini Defour back in Standards days
I feel you My choice for Origi is based on the fact that i feel he will have a growth period in the next two years that will make him more compatible with the players around him like Hazard and De Bruyne He is more unpredictable than Lukaku in the field but I got to give Lukaku credit though As for Benteke he seems to be having trouble finding his form maybe a transfer to a bigger team make change that for him
Belgium for Euros 2016 not much difference from WC2014 GK Courtois RB Meunier CB Kompany CB Alderweireld LB Vertonghen CDM Witsel CDM Niangolan RM Mirallas CAM De Bruyne LM Hazard ST Origi
Probably pretty unknown but Tom De Mul Belgian winger who spent his youth at Ajax similar route as Vertonghen Vermaelen and Alderweireld Managed to get a transfer to Sevilla which wasn t a bad club at the time but couldn t stay fit so retired when he was 28 last year Also Arsenal s Diaby and Spurs s King
They forgot Toby Alderweireld on loan at Southampton from Atletico Madrid and ex Ajax And of course other but thought he deserved a mention since Southampton is second in the BPL atm
I don t know if he counts yet since he hasn t proven himself in a top competition yet but Martin Odegaard is 15 years old and made his debut for Norway s national team already http youtu be Smi8jvNixL8
Thank you This is awesome I didn t know any of this Missed those good years sadly
Thank you so much that s so interesting Didn t know any of this How old was Totti when Real Madrid bid for him
Can someone tell me more about the hype around Totti and Pirlo when they were younger I was way too young to remember how they started out and i feel they ve been left out of this discussion
I feel that PSG would try to bring back Eric Gerits back to France He s familiar with the French way of playing and was a solid coach at Marseille Would be a surprise though Maybe even give Zidane a chance although these two are both Marseille men at heart you never know what money will do
Carlos Puyol will possibly make a good future coach He used to always be driven to steer his fellow team mates to stay focused and play their position correctlyI wonder if the defenders had played that to the end would Ronaldo still had made that weak header or would he have done something different They would ve certainly got to that if they didn t stop playing EDIT Also that defender marking Ronaldo should probably try to keep an eye on his man
Id be furious as a manager if I saw that heck even as a fan Id be mad
heck Please watch your language
it s a family show
I don t give a crud
Just imagine what kind of foul language we d be seeing if he was the manager
You kiss your mother with that mouth
Makes me think of the WC qualifier knockout between Sweden and Portugal Guys this Ronaldo chap is pretty good keep an eye on him
yea to be honest that should have been stopped Also on side note you can clearly see the lack of form he is still in with that attempt on net A form ronaldo would have put a solid effort on net Regardless goal and hopefully it helps him and the rest of us get back up from that loss sat
I know Ronaldo s fast but that afro guy didn t even try there until the pass was already on it s way
that Shakhtar defender
Defender
Hooooooly shit imagine letting the best player in the world run into your box in acres of space Edit I guess I mean one of the best thanks for the downvotes you morons
Wow 20 downvotes for asserting that Ronaldo might be the best player in the world
i mean it really is an absurd contention at this point
Didn t see Messi in the video
What was that number 66 doing
Gee I think that s Ronaldo
Dude couldn t be bothered to track back 10 feet Would have been an easy clearance The center back too looks like he could ve got there but he gets caught giving up before the ball is even in Not that the goal was his fault though
It was actually number 99 doing a handstand
He looks more like a rugby player than a footballer
probably hoping it would lead to a counter attack didn t really work out
that defending reminded me of this IRL lag posted over at r gifs by u fromthepharcyde
He s to my right I got him
What a pass by Bale
Modrics pass That was magic
Wouldn t mind seeing Modric at Bar a
Dude what is wrong with you
The Croatian double team with Rakitic Triple with Kovacic It s sexual
Croatian here By watching them play at the Croatian national team I would say they would do fuck all with all due respect to them they are indivudually amazing players Never seen them mesh together well though
Am I sexuuallll yeeeaaahhh Am I everything you need you better rock your gameplay now
He is a benfiquista
Just thought it would be amazing to see him playing there not that I dislike him at Real
Could anyone explain to me why he s being downvoted to oblivion I m genuinely curious as I don t understand what is going on here S Edit I m relatively unknowledgeable which is why I m trying to learn more
Probably because of the rivalry between Barca and Real It s like saying I d like to see Marcelo at Barca or Pique at Real
Not sure if he was trying a Nacho goal of his own
Pardon me if this is a joke but Bale was going for goal
LOL yes he did think he missed the goal
Does fantastic to spot the run and then be able to float it over
Much credit to Bale for Cristiano s goal
Huh Bale He made a simple pass which was actually just a wide shot The real credit for this goal should go to Modric not Bale or Ronaldo He created this goal solely Ronaldo and Bales part could be done by a U 13 to be honest
Not sure what U 13 would be able to make that run or chip that Bale did I think you are selling him very short
I don t think you realise which players are which in this clip
Not if you ask Cristiano at least in this clip
Hurr durr ronaldo is so selfish
Le arrogant Cristiano amirite
You idiot Edit that s all I could say initially This 10 second clip wasn t long enough to show the part where he serenades Bale
I would ve broken my skull on that post
As soon as ronaldo started running towards it I got scared
wtf was that dude doing trailing ronaldo as if he wasn t going to score
Well me must ve just thought Oh well in Benitez s system Ronaldo has about 1 5th the shots he usually does Especially now that Neymar Suarez and Messi are playing so well Cristiano likely suspects he won t make the the three man list for the Ballon D Or leading to a loss of spirits which along side his knee injury and age can be attributed to his loss of recent form that is a greater part of his decline No need to follow him here
And then Oh shit
You really put some thought into this huh
Felaini really let himself go
Good team goal
Im glad Bale is looking healthy Hopefully he can keep it up
Inzaghi would be proud
Quite bad defending do they not realize how fast Bale is Great play by Bale and Modric though
They guy covering Cristiano is the true criminal here if you ask me He just kinda watched as Cristiano ran passed him
Oh man what a pass from Modric
Impure
Fck that was close
Madrid doing their best impression of Barca s goal the other day
Tapinaldo
7 10 players would probably miss that
Yeah those open net shots from 6 inches are insanely hard
No they wouldn t
Those passes though
meh
Well that almost ended tragically
I WANT TO HAVE MODRICS BABIES
what is it with defenders just ignoring ronaldo and allowing him to stroll unmarked into scoring positions
Number 66 is good
knock off Marcelo definitely didn t help
wow Modric
the world is a better place when Cristiano Ronaldo is scoring goals
Defender 86 might wanna mark the second best player in the world a little closer than that Just a thought
Neymar played yesterday unless you mean Suarez who also played yeterday
Goddamn can t a guy make a joke on an internet forum without dickheads being all sanctimonious about arbitrary rankings of grown men Fuck s sake
Seems like you can t take a joke either m8
s Just bants man BANTZ
Unless you mean Iniesta
Is he dare I say it Back
Bale assists Ronaldo Ronaldo pretends Bale don t be here
That defender running with Bale was pathetic but he made up for it by kicking the ball out of the goal after it had crossed the line
what the ACTUAL FUCK was 66 doing what the fuck was he thinking
Typical goal by him But that pass by Modric though
Ronaldo goals lack the flair they used to come with These recent ones look like spoon fed boringness
how was the celebration
Reminds me kinda of Barca s fantastic MSN goal yesterday actually Great for Ronaldo though he really needed that bit of confidence
Reminds you in what exactly In both the ball went inside
He s most likely mentioning those over top sort of flick balls into the area
yes that I thought r soccer was football forum where people understood the game lol no
This sub is pretty bad for serious discussion
Only if you have a Real Madrid flair and or try to compare anything other than gods to Barcelona s players
your understanding of the game is so deep man You recognized a forward over the top pass as similar to another goal Can Real Madrid hire you already
Good one jackass
How can you not see the similarities
You tell me
Well both are goals scored in a Champions League football game if that s what you mean
Great for Ronaldo the new kid on the block seems to have the potential to now aim for greater heights and probably play for Segunda someday
Almost scored on the same play ten minutes later but the next time the keeper stayed in goal to save Ronaldo s header
dont thank bale
But all the couch managers here told me that Ronaldo should be benched I don t even know if those people were serious or just blinded by their hate of this man
Good point he really proved everyone wrong by heading it in unmarked from about 6 inches outside the goal World class finish Ronaldo showing his best definitely not Bale and Modric
Only the GOAT can score goal like that
He scored and that s enough Doesn t matter how We can t be 100 sure that this situation and goal would have occurred without Ronaldo Also I am not trying to put Bale or Modric down I m just saying that people that never touched a ball in their lives should not make stupid comments Even if it s biased or because they hate him it s still retarded to say that real should bench him
He scored and that s enough Everything that is wrong with football viewers in the past 5 10 years
You do know that the objective of football is to outscore an opponent If this is wrong with football viewers then what do you suggest is right
Have a holistic view of football Goals and assists are just the final 2 moves in a chain of events I am not gonna pretend that they are not important but to pontificate on them at the exclusion of everything else is what is wrong with football analysis at the moment I blame Messi and Ronaldo
Mate you re making that assumption of me based on this post alone I m not saying that goals are everything I m a defender and love clean tackles more than anything I m just saying when a player especially a forward scores a goal or two then he has done his job
He s hardly proved anyone wrong This is the kind of goal that someone in a slump can score without changing their future performances one bit because it doesn t do shit for confidence If someone who could actually make runs and be a threat offensively had started there is no way to be 100 sure it wouldn t be 0 3 already
Lol the last paragraph is enough for me to understand that you are probably one of those who do not watch his matches regularly but still like to shit on him
Your comment history is enough for me to understand that you have a reputation for starting and encouraging circlejerks in the past I understand it s new for you to be on the other side for once
Yeah unfortunately you ve come across Shaqiriii the one user you can guarantee will be at the bottom of every thread he comments in I d ignore the guy
Oh believe me I know who he is Just another guy who views reddit as a platform for starting arguments
That still does not change what I said You try to get back at me but it does not change that you re probably one of those couch managers that like to speak a lot without knowing much
I actually haven t said shit about Ronaldo before I saw your comment today I just thought you were just waiting for an opportunity to pretend like you re right about Ronaldo even if he doesn t actually perform well
I never said anything about Ronaldo s recent form so no I wasn t waiting for something like this to comment that I was right Check my history if you re bored and that interested in it or take my word for it
Of course not I wasn t implying that all 400k of us in r soccer were just watching for a comment by you specifically But I can guarantee that you had a preformed opinion about Ronaldo s form and you were waiting for anything that you thought would allow you to get upvoted via hivemind Unfortunately for you this isn t enough for a reasonable person to say that Ronaldo has regained his form So you got downvoted
American flair Your argument is invalid
America flair Your argument is invalid
Is it really
Asshole spotted comment worthless
American Real Madrid fan Argument is garbage
And so is your attitude Grow up
Yeah nobody else could ve scored an empty net header Maybe he deserved the bench maybe not but one easy goal against Shakhtar isn t a good indicator
He never deserves the bench Maybe he can be rested in unimportant matches but claiming that he should be benched is just either being biased or clueless Even he plays bad there is no replacement Who would he be benched for
People don t want to bench him because someone else plays better it s because the bench could motivate Ronaldo to work harder and get back in form It s not a difficult concept to understand managers do it all the time with underperforming stars Pique Enrique Hazard Mou
There are different ways to motivate players Playing bad should be enough motivation for him to get back to his level He is a hard worker and dedicated I don t think motivation is the problem Maybe it s his issues with his legs or the managers tactics not clicking but I do not think its motivation Who knows
Man you defend Ronaldo with all your heart Are you his publicist by the way Has he thanked you for it yet
Oh look it s my number one fan Nice to see you too
So I ll take it he hasn t thanked you Man must be hard you must spend several hours on the internet arguing and defending him only for him not to notice
Well at least you get some appreciation from me for being such a good fan So at least one of us is being thanked
TIL defending a player on Reddit being a good fan Damn why didn t nobody tell me going to away games is costly If someone had told me I could show my appreciation to my team just by defending a player on the internet I would gladly save up some money for more important things
Couch managers lol
A lot of Madrid fans who don t hate Ronaldo have also asked for him to be benched so it s not just people who hate this man
Lol madrid fans C mon man a lot of Real and Barca fans here are a bunch of gloryhunters that will turn on their stars as soon as they stop performing It s not only people here even in the stadiums in Spain they turn on their own players It s not like I think that a comment is more believable if a Real fan makes them or the other way around with Barca
I m not talking about reddit look at Madrid forums on the internet read what many are saying and many claim Ronaldo is past it and that he should be benched And yeah like you said the Bernab u as well My point is that people who have said Ronaldo should be benched are not always blinded by hatred like you stated
Fair enough but I said I don t know if they are serious or biased That means that it s worse if they re unbiased and serious in my opinion And both fanbases are not the most stable ones so I take whatever madrid and Barca fans say with a grain of salt
A tap and 5 on Soccer sad
I thought he was past it
Yup that was an incredible finish Definetly shows the true Cristiano is back
Haha I I was just joking
nah Ronaldo has ended his goal drought with this 3 yard screamer so all his critics have been proven wrongLes yeux dans les bleus is a really great football documentary
Yes Maybe one of the best there is
True
technically it is always one of the best
What No A bad documentary couldn t be technically considered as one of the best
why not Did you define how many are the best It can be part of the 10000 best
Then technically I m one of the world s best footballers
technically you are

A description of how Ronaldo plays Foo foo foo foo foo
And It s gone Children in Africa could ve eaten that ball
Best 9 ever I m not even kidding
It s crazy considering he was at his best when playing for Barcelona before his injuries He was like 21 Imagine how good he would have been without injuries
He was so amazing that even later in his career when he was fat as fuck burdened by years of injuries and hypothyroidism he was scoring like just a regular world class player at Milan and one of the highest scorers in the WC He had set such high standards that all people could talk about late career Ronaldo was how shit he was
Even when at Real Madrid he was amazing yet nowhere near as good as his earlier years A lot of people seem to think his prime was at Real Madrid when he was actually much better at PSV Barca and Inter
Imagine what would happen if he stayed at Barcelona and later teamed up with Kluivert Jesus Christ
One season at Barca 47 goals in 49 games Then he left for a better contract no fucks given
Puskas and Gerd Muller would like a word They d all be up there though
Muller was an excellent goal scorer but that s it The purest poacher the world has ever seen but not a pure 9 like Ronaldo
I want my striker number 9 whatever you call him to score goals If he does it by dribbling past three players and scoring or poaching them it s the same result I would take the flashier one there But Gerd Muller also scored much more goals than Ronaldo so that weighs in his favor I guess for a game in their prime I would take Ronaldo Over a career I d take Muller Puskas was a good mix of both though
It s silly to compare Puskas and Muller to Ronaldo and declare who the better 9 is Let s not act like all 3 didn t put up video game numbers The former two might have scored 3 goals per match with their dicks but I don t think a pure poacher could ever pull that off in Ronaldo s era
M ller was pretty good at everything actually His goals were typical poacher goals but he was fairly involved in the game
Well its whatever works Ronaldo may be one of the best players i ve ever been alive to see but i ve seen better strikers Suarez for one may actually be one of the best strikers i ve seen in a long time in that he s incredibly intelligent incredibly consistent and incredibly athletic The best player i ve ever seen is Messi best playmaker i ve ever seen is a tough one but i d give it to Iniesta or Zidane and best forward is a toss up between Ronaldo or Cristiano Ronaldo Best dribbler has to be Ronaldinho but I ve seen Neymar one up him once or twice Its nice to look at our childhood heroes with a nostalgic nod but Ronaldo s career was plagued with injuries and a little more disappointment than a lot of people care to remember He was the focal point of one of the most talented squads in recent history which is a high honor in itself But as far as pure 9s go i ve seen better Shevchenko for example was a better striker Ronaldo was definitely more talented but goals are goals
u wot
The same people who think Ronaldo is the undisputed best striker of all time ever are the same people that think Ronaldinho is a top 10 player Paul Scholes is the best midfielder of his generation and Zidane is the sleeper hit of his generation There have been better strikers than Ronaldo as early as Thierry Henry in 2004 While his technique was flawless and his athleticism was incredible at one point he merely set the standard a standard that has been reached more than once in the last decade I fully accept anybody people calling him what he is a legend but being il fenomino doesn t make you the best of all time ever His entire career was defined by 8 years 1994 2002 8 nearly perfect years but there have been better scorers better forwards and faster players side then
Rofl Here is Luis Enrique s last week interview about Ronaldo I d seen him on television at PSV and thought wow Then he came to Barcelona He s the most spectacular player I ve ever seen He did things I d never seen before We re now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players but not then
Shearer too
Suarez will be in with a shout in a few years if he isn t already
how old are you if you don t mind me asking Ive watched r9 in his prime and currently enjoying suarez While suarez will no doubt go down as one of the great forwards R9 will for a long time be the best ever to play in the position There is no arguing this fact what he did back then was ridiculous Remember this was also an era when little touch didn t end of being called a foul An era when slide tackling was such a big part of the game It was a golden era for defenders
Asking his age comes across as a little condescending The things Suarez has achieved especially after only recently coming into a top team are incredible He s a magnificent player and his all around work effort I m sure puts Ronaldo s to shame Suarez is only 28 and if he maintains this level and remains injury free for another 4 years or so then we would truly be talking about one of if not the greatest strikers ever
lol not how i meant it what i meant was if he got a chance to see ronaldo on live tv or even live but yea
Team achievements shouldn t decide which player was better Ronaldo dominated La Liga at age 19 or 20 Suarez was having a good debut season in the Eredivisie at that age I m not sure if your age comment means that you really haven t watched him back in the day but if not I can only recommend watching some video footage of him He really wasn t called el fenoemno for nothing Even after his injury he was still playing on an incredible level so there will always be this big if concerning what could have been sadly And I definitely know how good Suarez is
LOL NO
I m 27 I m the perfect age to have some childhood bias for R9 Suarez is very close if not as good He s been dominating leagues for years
Suarez is not any where near as prolific but the comparison bears merit if only because they have a VERY similar playing style
I m 35 Suarez is miles away from the best Ronaldo The Ronaldo at Barcelona was not just the best player around he totally and utterly dominated the game He was unplayable
He carried mediocre Inter squad to ultra competitive Seria A in his first year only finishing 2nd due to controversial match vs Juve Also carried them to win UEFA cup Suarez is a beast but Ronaldo prior his 2x knee injuries was just on whole another level
controversial Nice euphemism
I think people tend to give more weight to what they see now R9 was truly one of the most dominant players I ve even seen And I m old
The sentiment that Suarez is as good or better as ronaldo was would ve been extremely dumb in the time period between 2010 and 2012 where he helped take Uruguay to the World Cup semi finals and the Copa America title and it would ve been just a tad controversial when he took Liverpool to a second place finish with a POTY worthy display But a treble and a clasico rout later I don t think its fair to undersell him any longer Suarez is exceptional and any notion that he isn t at Ronaldo s level is just weird I m not actually sure if there s anything Ronaldo could do back in the day that Suarez can t do now The only thing separating them is 3 biting incidents and a bit of racism
Ronaldo is still a class above believe it or not The speed power control finishing
not even close
Suarez is awesome deffo 1 striker right now I still believe R9 was the most talented forward out there though He was basically an upgraded Suarez faster stronger with better ball control 34 goals in 37 matches for Barcelona at age 21 Phenomenal And then injuries hit Also is it just me or did Suarez get smaller in Barcelona He was a boar in Liverpool and now he looks lanky
He may look less bulky but he s as strong as ever
Not really Probably not even top 10 since 2000
Name 10 better since 2000 then
I m not really agreeing with u KrisDoolan but this seemed a nice exercise to do so here we go I did not include CR7 because I consider him more a winger than a 9 Otherwise he d obviously be with the 5 guys above Suarez Players I ranked above Suarez ie if I ran a team and had to choose between prime Suarez and prime player X I d go for player X without thinking about it too much Ronaldo Raul Henry Messi Rooney Players that I rank kind of the same level as Suarez with the same reasoning as above I d have to think a long time before choosing between prime Suarez and prime player X Ibrahimovic Shevchenko Van Nistelrooy Drogba Eto o Totti Tevez Aguero Pre Chelsea Torres Benzema
Half the strikers you listed are mostly known for exceptional finishing They are essential for turning a really good team into a great team The wonderful thing about Suarez though is that he brings so much more than just scoring goals to the table He is absolutely essential for Barca s pressing He was playing both finisher and playmaker for Liverpool When Suarez left Liverpool they simply could not fill the hole in the team The other players you mentioned were wonderful players but teams can cope fairly well when they lose strikers like Van Nistelrooy Raul and Shevchenko
Of the prime player X in the first scenerio only Henry Messi and Ronaldo have a case against Suarez Of the 10 in the second pool only Shevchenko has a case Suarez is comfortably better than all the rest Rooney was great in his prime but nothing to write home about Drogba is my fav striker but Anelka was always better he s just a better captain Eto o Tevez Totti and Ibrahimovich are cult icons but they re not without competition Aguero Benzema Torres and Van Nistelrooy have always been effective and efficient but Suarez has always played a much bigger and better role for club and country And Raul wasn t that good Having scoring records doesn t make you the best striker ever He was great but Real Madrid had no problem replacing him or Van Nistelrooy for that matter when the time came I d liken them to Inzaghi great club legend not the best striker None of them compare to Suarez in the slightest
Del Piero Vieri Van Basten Baggio Bergkamp Batistuta They would all be above Suarez I d say
Rooney even at his prime better than Suarez lol
Props for putting in the effort Would take Suarez ahead of Rooney and Raul Also ahead of Shevchenko RVN Dorgba Totti Tevez Torres probably Karim as well Only one on that list I would absolutely without question take ahead of Suarez would be Messi and he s not actually a striker
Ronaldo Henry Van Nistelrooy prime Shevchenko prime Torres Raul Ibrahimovic Eto o Del Piero Aguero
good list you forgot prime Falcao comparing him to Ronaldo fenomeno is just silly they are different worlds
I was going to mention Falcao because he was an absolute monster at Atletico but I believe this is only his second ever season of Champions League football so I was kind of reluctant to put him in there
I d rather have him on my team over everyone else except maybe Henry Ronaldo and prime Shevchenko
Definite no on Van Nistlerooy Shevchenko Torres Raul Eto o Del Piero Aguero Other three are maybe s at best
I m sorry but motherfucking Ronaldo is not a maybe at best I think you re either massively exaggerating how good Suarez is or you don t remember just how good some of those players were Van Nistelrooy especially had a much better scoring record especially in the Champions League likewise with Shevchenko Raul and Eto o
Nostalgic revisionism I think you re overrating a number of those players especially RVN Sheva Raul
Ruud set a number of records for his goalscoring exploits and had an absolutely ridiculous record in Europe same goals per game as Messi and higher than Ronaldo Shevchenko won the Ballon d Or and is Milan s 2nd all time top scorer only behind Gunnar Nordahl It took Messi and Ronaldo until last year to beat Raul s CL goals record He was Real Madrid s top scorer ever until the start of the season Suarez has achieved shit compared to them
Trying not to be biased but you are really underestimating Del Piero one of the best Italian players to every play the game
What could ve been Ironic that both he and Ronaldo arguably the two most promising and best strikers in the world at that time would end up having their career ruined by their knees
Why would you be kidding He is the best number 9 of all time
I still don t think Brazil would ve won if Ronaldo was fully fit in the final but they would have played much better in attack
Its simple break his fucking legs
Thanks Roy Keane
FOU FOU FOU
Nice Fortunately for them Ronaldo ended up playing one of his worst ever games in that final
Well his name wasn t even on the teamsheet before the match it was a last minute decision to play him Doctor Lidio Toledo revealed the striker had been rushed to hospital after suffering a convulsion in his sleep but cleared to play after neurological and cardiac tests Such a shame really http news bbc co uk sport3 worldcup2002 hi history newsid 1749000 1749324 stm EDIT Also many other theories as to what happened the night before
There s a strong rumour that he was forced to play by sponsors most notably Nike
This
to this day I still believe the rumors that he was poisoned by the French in their hotel
he was definitely not 100 in that match The disparity between the final and the previous games is absurd Like two completely different players
Probably shouldn t have played at all
Cool seeing them all giddy like a fan would be seeing skill like that up close
Why is this unverified
This is amazing
Watching him in his prime was mesmerizing Just simply unplayable regardless of the talent you put against him

OM also lost Fanni and Lemina
Considering how big the population of France is it s strange how they never produced elite teams like Spain England Germany and Italy They ve had sporadic success but nothing consistent
That has nothing to do with population though Portugal has 10 million inhabitants and they have successfull teams in an european scale Aside from PSG french teams are not attractive enough because we do not have enough money to pay premier league like wages due to fiscality low tv rights deals less attractivity
My point is going back to the start of European football why did no huge teams develop in France like they did in other countries The national team wasn t great either until the 80s
Because historically rugby was a bigger sport in France than football
Oh ok I knew rugby was popular in France but had no idea it was actually bigger than football
Higher percentage of the French population plays rugby than in NZ In the south especially it s all rugby country
The french rugby league top 14 is the biggest rugby league in the world
In the southwest this is true but absolutely not anywhere north of the Loire and at least doubtful in the southeast
I don t think there s any way around the fact that France is an outlier The top 4 leagues are 4 of the 5 most populous nations in Western Europe Portugal may have strong teams league relative to population size but they re still well behind Spain England Germany and Italy
Not enough money Atletico s budget is comparable to that of Marseille and Lyon and they reached the CL final while OL and OM have a combined 0 1 10 in their last CL games Also was money the problem when Lyon got ONE point out of 6 against Gent When they were eliminated by APOEL When they were eliminated by Astra Giurgiu When PSG couldn t qualify for EL s round of 32 in a group with Slovan Bratislava and Red Bull Salzburg Let me be clear Ligue 1 sucks and PSG s titles have never felt so hollow But quit trying to find excuses for your poor management French football has never been at a lowest point in decades PSG is our only ray of light but then again We are owned by a dictatorship This situation sucks so much I fucking hate it
Actually Atletico s budget is around 190 million euros Marseille for this season has a budget of 125 million euros A huge part of the budget is dedicated to salaries As a fellow french you should know that the fiscality is very high compared to Spain Marseille for instance had to renovate their stadium same can be said for Lyon with their new stadium It is estimated that Marseille lost 26 million euros over 3 years because of that don t know about Lyon but given it is their stadium and they paid for it the loss is huge Also we had to sell key players this summer so we could conform with FFP regulations Gignac left for free Payet Imbula Ayew left Nkoulou and Mandanda will be leaving FOR FREE at the end of the season We can not just pay premier league like wages because we simply do not have the money to Sure there is probably a problem in terms of management but for some reason and probably others I m far from being knowledgeable on the subject we lack the money to compete internationaly Best clubs are the richest that s all
We lack the money to compete internationally How do you explain that Portuguese clubs constantly trample ours That teams from Cyprus eliminated OL and Nice Danish club eliminated Saint Etienne
French clubs tend not to take europa league seriously because there is little financial reward with a huge investment given that there is way more fixtures in an already overbooked schedule See Christophe Galtier comment a year ago or so Portuguese clubs bring very talented players from south america through third party ownership and anyway the transfer fee is low Plus their academy is on point
That s true but I don t what your point is Are you saying that money isn t the main problem and Portuguese clubs are much better managed than us
I was just explaining why they have more success than us with a lower budget
Well that s kind of my point isn t it If we recruited better and if we took Europe more seriously we wouldn t be in this situation
Incomparable
Comparable In 2013 2014 Atletico s budget was 170M Marseille s 130 One went to the Final of the CL the other 0 0 6 in the group stages
Ah I see what you mean although there are other factors to consider as well
Of course of course But we in France always like to blame it on money I m saying that s really not our main problem
I was once told that in France the taxes alone of you declare over 1M income are upwards of 50 and to keep the big names happy and staying in PSG the Qataris actually cover those extra taxes for the players Not sure how true it is though
It is very strange only one winner in all of European Cup Champions League history
When has the EPL had consistent success in Europe outside of 04 09
Through the 70s and 80s across each competition
How so
A team in the european cup final 9 times between 1975 1985 7 times winners Spread across 4 different teams imagine any league doing the same now
Look up European Cup finals between 1976 and 1985
Ah I took his statement to mean two decades of dominance though I think the run was from 76 84
England were solid from 70 76 dominant from 76 85 and probably would have continued to be for a little while if not for the Heysel disaster
England were solid from 70 76 Might want to extend that window a bit m8 I mean who could forget our stunning Inter Cities Fairs Cup victory over jpesti D zsa in 1969
English and German teams pretty much exclusively dominated European football in the 70s and 80s until Heysel
The fact that almost none of them own their own stadia and rent from local councils really holds them back
Don t forget that Lyon also have Fekir unavailable due to his torn ACL that he got two months ago
Saint Etienne also sold Maximin to Monaco if that counts
So you are saying the league is shit Except for PSG
The league is poor
Ligue 1 is being bought out by the big 4 leagues but it s France s fault Why aren t French clubs offering bigger contracts bar PSG
LOL Clubs can t type rosebud IRL you re pretty much asking why a single mom working as a waitress can t buy a Lambo
Euuh because they don t have the money You know that with all the taxes a player costs to his Ligue 1 club 17 times what he would cost to a spanish club And if the player ends up being injured or shit DNCG will make sure you re relegated France is not Spain
It s France s fault exactly Not French clubs fault Here over 1M a year 50 goes to the country Under it s more complicated but let s say about 25 So if you want a player to earn 5M a year the club has to pay 9 5M approximately And I have probably forgotten A LOT of things I actually don t know shit about this juste it s super high tax here for high salaries Plus French club aren t wealthy compared to English clubs because English clubs are the main problem Spanish German Italian too but mainly English PS I love MKP Was a big fan during the MKP DRG area at MLG

So everyone in the league is bad It s just PSG are average
I d rather say everyone in the league is average beside PSG who are good Nice lost against Ajaccio and Nantes but went to beat Lyon and Marseille for example PSG can afford to keep their best players which brings stability Marseille and Monaco lost half their team during summer Only Lyon kept their players wages were raised but eventually they lost F kir
Didn t Monaco lose half their team due to a change in policy They have plenty of money right They could have retain some players
It s a mixture of things but they definitely did want to mix up their squad a bit to hopefully get a better project going They let go of a lot of prospects that they felt were not panning out like Ocampos for example We lost half our squad because the club isn t very profitable any more Ayew and Labrune tried several times to extend his contract and our owner simply doesn t give a shit any more They netted 50m off of the sales of our squad this summer and she s going to sell as soon as someone offers
Things haven t been going that great for OM a shame that s happening to a team as great as you I really hope you regain your rightful place in Ligue 1
Eh thanks for the kind words but we have no right to anything in the league We get what we deserve and it s not weird that we are doing poorly given the circumstances It looks like Michel finally figured things out last weekend so I m hoping things will begin to improve
They had to sell some to break even per FFP but Martial wasn t supposed to be sold but given the 80 million offer it was impossible to reject
Why does Monaco lose so many players Aren t they still supported by a rich suggardaddy
Beside this divorce story he eventually did not lost half his money to his ex wife as far as I know they have to sell because of FFP AS Monaco because of its history has many fans in the whole France they ve one of the best away crowd But the home stadium is empty because Monaco is small and full of rich people And this can t work with FFP
He s lost basically nothing to his wife she is in huge debt and will have to completely capitulate at this point he has offered her half of what he originally offered her at the beginning of proceedings and only for 10 years rather than the rest of her life and she ll have to take it His daughter sided against the mother and basically shot down most of her case The issue is that he is happy to spend money as he has shown but he will not spend money if it means he ll have to pay millions in fines to UEFA so the policy shifted from big name star signings to young players with a lot of potential and Jardim with complete control of the squad and transfers along with a Portuguese scout he brought with him They buy low sell high and it will allow a core of players to develop and sell off one or two each season to cover the loss a like Lyon 10 years ago except a bigger safety net So they sold a lot of players one more than they wanted to Martial but obviously with 80 million on the table it was impossible to reject but the project isn t over
Yup you explained their change of policy and their new project well The only thing is that given the context it s even more difficult to create a chemistry between players in Monaco imo They had it last year and they sold everyone I doubt they can create this every year And when you bring in so many new players the risk is to miss on the CL spots Less exposure for the players and you can t sell too high beside they don t buy thaaat low they buy pretty high and want to sell very high
Makes sense I just wish that they d balanced the team better I mean yeah sell Martial for that crazy fee but then buy a good centre back and a good LB RB and another DM Then they d probably be okay Instead they have like 20 wingers and attacking midfielders and two 35 year olds playing defence
Sugardaddy that lost half his money to his ex wife IIRC
That wasn t true actually
Ok my mistake then The thing is he doesn t want to spend huge money on Monaco now so they are more a seller club than a buyer like any club in France other than Lyon or Paris The fact that English clubs are drunk with money that the french taxes cost a lot to the clubs makes the best players of the league go away and team are constantly rebuilding Plus this season PSG are performing good and all the others quite badly explaining this Actually PSG point per game is lower than Bayern per instance but Lyon has really few points for a 2nd after 14 games
We play bad while PSG play how they should with the budget they have They only have 2 draws and no loses so far
Mid and low table clubs are doing surprisingly well hello Nice and Angers Top table clubs are doing quite bad JUST LOOK AT MY CREST
It s that PSG is excellent and that other middle sized team especially Lyon Marseille and Monaco had a pretty rough start
Off topic but I can t wait to see Red Star get promoted and have a Paris derby in Ligue 1 do you think it could happen soon
Red Star is currently 6th 4 points behind Metz 3rd I honestly think it s going to be complicated this year especially since the games have to be played in Beauvais as Stade Bauer doesn t suit the league s standards But for a club like Red Star there s no need to rush sometimes it s better to spend a few years in Ligue 2 before playing with the big boys especially because of DNCG Red Star doesn t have a strong financial back up like Paris FC with fuckin Vinci
Seriously We don t blame it on PSG because we want we blame it on PSG because this is without a doubt entirely their fault PSG fans have nothing to do with it though you can t expect them to want their team to not win every game
PSG fault if teams like Lyon or Marseille underperform terribly They should have much more points by now and this thread wouldn t exist Lyon Marseille Monaco all have budgets above 100M Caen and Angers 25M Lyon lost against La Gantoise I think it s around 30M Those teams are underperforming I can t see how this is without a doubt entirely PSG fault
Can we just stop the season and call it a wrap right now I mean we all know what s going to happen the rest is just filler crap like Dragon Ball Z
Nah dude it s too interesting for us We could be top 6 or relegated nobody knows
I for one hope relegated Imagine the clusterfuck
Honestly it would just be the current clusterfuck amplified a bit and might even help get the club sold So oddly enough I m not as afraid of that as I should be Besides won t you miss the Aluas Labrune bantz
Imagine Aulas twitter with Labrune in Ligue 2 though That s just sounds like Christmas
I think we re forgetting there probably would be no more Labrune if we were relegated at least there better not be He could go to ASSE for continued banter
I would be ok with that even though CL football may kill us straight away
On the one hand Lyon have 25 points in 14 games so 25 42 which is poor for second place On the other PSG have 38 42 which is also huge That s what leads to such a disparity an extraordinarily good 1st place team but also a very mediocre second team
That is one of the consequence of the EPL being so rich The best french players used to leave France for the big 4 now they even leave top 5 teams in France to play bottom teams in England The only team that can keep its players is PSG Then english fan complain that it is easier for PSG in champion s league because Ligue1 is uncompetitive But you created the monster
Let s see there s Thauvin going to Newcastle the Ayews going to Swansea and Villa Hazard and Zouma going to Chelsea so yeah players from top 5 teams in France are leaving to play for relegation zone teams except for Swansea of course
You glossed over Payet to West Ham Azpilicueta and Remy to Chelsea
Remy left Marseille for QPR
He took the long way
I think the conversation was only about bottom half teams so fair shout on the Chelsea ones but Payet is going to a much more relevant club in West Ham which is understandable
Amavi Vertout to Villa as well
I spy the hidden bantz
Big 4 being Real Barca Bayern United
Maybe he means big 4 in England Arsenal Chelsea City United in recent memory
I think in this context the big 4 refers to Arsenal Chelsea United and Liverpool
Sky 4
Arsenal Leicester City United FTFY
Arsenal Leicester City United Leicester City so good they take up two spots in the top 4
No dude I was talking about Bristol City
Wait not Norwich City the ones who put a mighty 2 past Newcastle and constantly produce goals of the season
Fucking Norwich Hell no
I think he meant Lyon Marseille and maybe Lille and PSG
What are you talking about We had to sell Gameiro Nullifying our chances of european victory forever
Kind of off topic but what the hell happened to Lyon They used to be a top team in Europe and roll Ligue 1 year after year and now they are bottom of their group in the CL behind powerhouses like Zenit and Gent and haven t won the league since 2008
Lyon had a formidable upcoming in the mid 2000 s Very well managed They started making good money and saved it Then they for some unexplained reason they splashed all of their cash on Kader Keita 2007 16 Million Ederson 2008 14 million Jean II Makoun 2008 14 million John Mensah 2008 9 million Michel Bastos 2009 18 million Yoann Gourcuff 2010 26 5 million Pretty much every single one of them was a flop Then they decided it was the perfect time to build a stadium BOOOM
All you need to know
This is a good perspective but really only addresses the past couple seasons I m wondering more why they went from historically dominant in the mid 2000 s to where they are now Certainly the rise of PSG and their unlimited funds has something to do with it in the most recent seasons but they were falling from glory even before that for some reason They won 7 straight titles from 2002 2008 which is pretty amazing
they are bulding their own stadium so their last big transfert 30m was hm gourcuf in 2010 but he fails with injurys less than 30 full games played in 5 five years since 2011 they are only on young players and own formation lacazet fekir grenier gonallon martial but sold to monaco like arsenal did during many years
But we went to finish second in the ligue with 8 of our starter being formed at the club Lopes Umiti Gonalons Ferri Tolisso Grenier Lacazette Fekir If only we could form more defender instead of buying shitty player for 8 millions But guess they don t sell for the same amount so are not worth
They started overpaying for average players That s what shocked me the most And when talks about FFP began they decided to invest on a new stadium which will be finished soon Meanwhile they mostly had to rely on their academy players Ligue 1 s lack of attractivity didn t help them As well as the rise of Bordeaux and Lille

Interesting read
PSG have been able to sleepwalk through the league so far Even their bad performances have been mostly unpunished This is more indicative of the exodus in talent this year I don t expect it to stay this way next season
Yeah especially since many PSG players will play this summer You could see last season that PSG poor start was due to the players being tired and injury proned after the World Cup While OM players looked very very strong physically
Remember when they lost to Caen last year Good days
Owww you
I surely do inb4 it happens again
It s like when I play FIFA Career Mode on intermediate
Can t get away from the viral Bernie Sanders marketing anywhere on this site
Reddit has to do it because no one else will Hillary will probably win the nomination pretty easily in the real world she is much more recognizable Not that I would mind Sanders as president but this site is it s own little bubble You would have thought Ron Paul was going to be president last time this was the only place you read about American politics
I was just having a good natured pop at our old troubling but useful friend Modern Capitalism
First time I ve been on Reddit for Months and live in a Red State Bernie is pretty popular Favorite to win the Democratic nomination No At this point he is more than a dark horse However will young people get out to vote in the primaries History says probably not
PSG seem like they really need Ronaldo next season
How s that
It was sarcastic There s a lot of speculation over Ronaldo going to PSG and clearly PSG seem to be doing fine without one of the best players on the planet
I believe he s referring to how Real Madrid are starting to play worse with him on the pitch than if someone else who is younger and not nursing a chronic knee injury would be playing
Lyon won Ligue 1 7 times back to back this is nothing
Without having a Qatari daddy And we never steamrolled it
Without having a Qatari daddy Hmm Lyon went public Stock market daddy Also let s not forget OL Coiffure and OL Taxi

well that s ligue 1 we re talking about
This is a really cool stat fact
Noice
Inb4 PSG is ruining the league
You fucking are though Like seriously I like that you re playing well in Europe but watching the league is a fucking chore with your Qatari whores ruining the integrity of football
Your club did the same for 7 years though And you used to buy the best players from Ligue 1 thus weakening the league
Oh yeah totally similar situations Aulas is some foreign prince that injected a shitload of money in the club There s a difference between strategic presidents and sugar daddies
Precisely situations are not the same Lyon bought the best players from other Ligue 1 teams to secure their 1rst spot every year PSG brings in international stars which increases the TV rights on par with Germany can you imagine which makes more money for Lyon and the other clubs PSG does have shitload of money It doesn t mean this money isn t used as wisely as it can be QSI s strategy is pretty neat if you ask me Aulas is the best president in France It doesn t mean he didn t make big mistakes that cost a lot to OL Cissoko 15M remember
Lyon bought the best players from other Ligue 1 teams to secure their 1rst spot every year You re saying that as if it was easy and we just overspent everbody else they wanted to come here because they believed in what Aulas was creating most of them at least because had we ended up getting Pauleta or Drogba we d probably have a CL Budget wise PSG and Marseille were close to us Nowadays PSG spend 5 times more than anybody else that s not comparable We bought Essien Malouda and Abidal when they were unproven outside of France to Bastia Guimgamp and Lille not really contenders back then Paris buys Ibra Di Maria D Luis Cavani Thiago Silva just the same right We dominated because other big clubs were badly ran now the other big clubs don t even have a chance
Yeah you have some good points Although I think Aulas didn t really want Pauleta he just wanted to destabilize PSG back then by offering him a lot of money Essien Malouda and Abidal are good examples Shame you couldn t capitalize on the successes of this policy who knows what your budget would be like today Instead Aulas started overpaying for average players He was also unlukcy with Gourcuff Ofcourse with all this money PSG is supposed to lead the league But this thread is about those 13 points between PSG and Lyon This shows more about how the other big clubs are underperforming And honestly Marseille and even Lyon since a few years are badly run too
How are we badly run We had to trim the salary bill a lot starting around 2011 to pay for the new stadium so Aulas gambled on going young and we have finished 4 3 5 2 in those rebuilding years now we re back to regular spending We ll see if we can consistently play the CL now
Mostly the choice of players and the money spent to bring them since a few years including this summer with the exception of the very last few seasons when you pretty much entirely relied on your youth system You save money for years and you splash it out to bring it Beauvue and Valbuena Brilliant choice Glad if you re satisfied with that
Don t forget about Yanga Mbiwa He cost them around 10M if I m not mistaken
So one bad transfer window analyzed after 4 months makes a club badly run K Also splash it out Under 10M combined so David Luiz s left arm That s making it rain
Strong but fair Like a tackle from Puyol
Except the fact that Lyon havent exactly beng doing well in the league have they Lyon dont play PSG every week so cant blame them there same goes to all the other teams Last year Lyon finished 8 points behind PSG in the league with monaco only 4 points behind Lyon That seems like a pretty normal league standing doesnt it Same thing happened with Chelsea last season City finished 8 behind them Would you say Chelsea are ruining the league This Fuck PSG they are ruining the french league circle jerk needs to fuck off Everyone under PSG is under performing compared to last season and thats not PSG s fault is it Monaco have spent a shit load to get to where they are and no one complains about them
Paris under performed a lot in the league last year and they still had 8 points over a team which surprinsingly over performed
So its their fault Got it When Chelsea went undefeated for a massive amount of time last year were they ruining the league The teams under PSG are dropping a lot of points and Lyon has only 7 wins from 14 games Thats half of their games have been dropped points and they are 2nd Like I said just because the rest of the league is under performing isn t PSG s fault Bayern Munich have been very solid in recent years are they ruining the Bundesliga
Why are you bringing up Chelsea and Bayern The point is when a team overwhelmingly dominates financially every other member of the league it s playing in there s obviously no surprise on who s going to win It s like Juve s year in Serie B every other team knew they weren t playing for first place So yeah in a sense you can argue that it s ruining the league because even on match day 1 there s no suspense on who will end up winning
Im bringing up Chelsea and Bayern because they are relatively similar to PSG Bayern have been dominating the bundesliga for years but no one crys about them do they Do they say they are ruining the league What about Chelsea they were undefeated for a good portion of last year and were unchallenged really and have spent a lot compared to other teams but once again no one says they ruin the league So whats with all the PSG hate Ligue 1 teams under PSG are under poerforming and you cant deny that even though you dont mention it at all You can talk about PSG ruining the league but Monaco spent a shit load of money to get to where they are now and like I said just because you spend money doesnt guarantee success you guys were 8 points from them last year and were on top at one point so what there What about when Atletico Madrid won the league They arent exactly even financially when it comes to Madrid Barca are they I dont know where the circle jerk came from but there are so many teams that the same could be said about but PSG seems to get all the shit
Decades of success domestic and European got Bayern there There are about 4 5 different teams in England with financial means comparable to Chelsea s so it s competitive PSG has no competition in the league and got there because some guys decided to invest hundreds of millions in a club How is that fair estimate by Le Parisien of clubs operating budget for this season They spend as much as the next 4 combined how am I supposed to believe we or anybody else can compete
They spend as much as the next 4 combined how am I supposed to believe we or anybody else can compete Because you came within 8 points of them last year Even so it still doesnt explain dropping points in half of your games this year you cant blame you being 11 points behind on PSG you guys are playing poorly Also Man City and Chelsea spend considerably more than other teams bar united but they arent succesful in recent years so its not really competitive between 4 teams then is it
This is inevitably what happens when one team in a league has ambitions to step up to compete at elite level and gets the funds to do so CL has severely distorted national leagues in the last 10 years Even if Lyon or OM were performing as expected they still would be unable to maintain over the course of a season i e look at 14 15 So I can totally see the point of people getting angry about this when it is clear that no other team has the means to challenge
They don t have more ambitions they have a fuckload more money than us
Yeah wanting to win the Champions League and building bit by bit a squad capable of doing it that s not ambition at all
Where did I not say that I hate ambition arguments that fans of massive clubs use to blame other teams for a lack of competition I just meant it s what is to be expected when one team is chosen by the Arabian oil gods to get rich and challenge at a continental level The owners don t give a fuck about the domestic league
You know that s not true if Fournier had any ambitions you wouldn t finish 4th of group H against Valencia Zenit Gent Yes the lack of money is an issue but it s not the only one Ligue 1 teams have recently 5 years underperformed in European Competitions Now PSG became a rich club in Ligue 1 with mostly foreign players and reach quarter finals every year If we had more than 3 French players in the starting squad I don t think we would go far in CL Lyon did poor investments during their mercato You were unlucky to loose F kir but a club can t rely only on one player You kept an average manager who hasn t any European competitions experience I don t see any ambitions at all when I see Lyon picking ex Marseille average footballers or the 2nd choice from Serie A PL
You kept an average manager Who finished second in his first season after taking a team that finished fifth the previous season And you are the epitome of a PSG fan Oh so poor investments why didn t you buy Neymar or Boateng You can afford that We buy fucking second string Serie A and PL players because it s the best we can afford This isn t fucking Football Manager where we can buy some kid from Brazil and expect miracles this is real life I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us
why didn t you buy Neymar or Boateng We buy fucking second string Serie A and PL players because it s the best we can afford Kader Keita 2007 16 Million Ederson 2008 14 million Jean II Makoun 2008 14 million John Mensah 2008 9 million Michel Bastos 2009 18 million Yoann Gourcuff 2010 26 5 million You are the epitome of a OL fan Arrogant pretentious and ignorant T es vraiment un gros gros mais alors un gros de chez gros blaireau toi
come on guys hug it out um marchons marchons
I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us I don t see that happening anytime soon
I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us And then Ligue 1 can go the way of the Eredivisie or the Brasileiro Sure routinely losing your best footballers as soon as they show the slightest bit of potential will hurt the league more than the investment QSI has brought tv package comparable to Germany and not too far off Spain benefiting everyone but at least PSG won t have a lot of money
can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us What a great comment
Woeful league save Zlatan and get him out of there A S A P
That s the most inaccurate comment on Ligue 1 I ve ever seen in here
It s difficult to make any accurate comment when you are being overwhelmed by hormones I mean give the poor guy a break suddenly becoming pubescent is a very unsettling thing in someone s life
Ok without us Ligue 1 Arsenal would be a shit club but whatever
To be fair so would many teams in the Premier League
Especially Newca oh they re already shit
Another flop in the CL and PSG will surely start to lose their financial backing French football is abysmal
French football is abysmal but I m not sure PSG have really flopped in the CL in the past few years We got trampled by Barcelona last year but well who didn t
The year before that they lost to us on away goals and the year before it was Barca also on away goals Hardly flops pretty unlucky in all honesty
Boring leagueModric s first goal from inside the box with Madrid
luka modric scores me wipes away tear with one hand and fist pumps with the other while silently mouthing my boy
He s just a player that s hard to hate It s crazy to think that If he didn t score that wonder goal vs Manchester Utd a few years ago that he probably would have been sold
My bae
Watching modric score is like watching an angel get its wings
was this his first goal inside the box for real madrid
yes
was the keeper under arrest
Just got my Modric kit in the mail yesterday perfect timing His tempo today was great very good linkup and forward pressing
Lukas first goal in over a year
Fuckin finaly He has so amazing shot and he just never uses it for some reason
Gorgeous finish
Modrulja is best D
Why wasn t that initial pass to Ronaldo offsides Isn t he well past the last defender

Yeah he should stop saving the world all the time and concentrate on football
I mean it s either assist or no assist right So yeah not gonna be 33 each
He will never be without detractors no matter what he does When you reach the level he has reached you re gonna be under a damn microscope for everything you do I do not envy that sort of pressurePogba is killing us here
Pogba has been going off this game
If people think that was a foul just never watch football again If you can t have those battles then football is a lost cause Otamendi just got beat
Think he was trying too hard to get a foul called
Hard to say from this particular clip to be fair
LOL at Otamendi 2nd awful error against Juve
pretty garbage positioning and looked outmuscled by mandzukic of all people for much of the game
Actually outmuscling defenders and beating them physically in the air and on the ground is an area Mandzukic excels in So it shouldn t come as a surprise that he of all people gives center backs trouble in those situations
I don t see much of Mandzukic so you may be right that he punches above his weight but Ota was totally out of position and will need to do better Mandzukic is smaller than most EPL strikers
6 4 is small for a PL striker nowadays
Google says 6 2 and 185 pounds He s slightly bigger than I thought but shouldn t be outmuscling Otamendi
And Otamendi is 6 and 180 pounds
No but compared to Neymar and Messi and Suarez and Dybala and Aguero he s definitely a stronger striker of all people Strikers aren t usually known for being massive punishers
But center backs are expected to be strong Mandzukic has 5 pounds on suarez who is the same size as otamendi He just ain t that big
Centrebacks are supposed to be strong yeah Everyone s agreeing with you there The reason you re getting downvoted by people is because you used the phrase of all people which implies that Mandzukic is weak compared to other strikers Yeah he might struggle to outstrengthen a lot of center backs but compared to other strikers he ain t weak
The whole game he was getting outmuscled ref bailed him out most of the time though
I really didn t see why he gave half the fouls I cracked up when he gave that last foul against Marchisio still don t get what the ref was thinking XD
That run from Pogba
65 metres according to the french broadcast I was watching
Fuck I forgot about this game why the hell am I watching PSG
Weak defending but cracking cross
Pogba and Sandro have been playing so well recently
Otamendi one of the strongest defenders around complaining about that contact is just laughable
i ve watched every city game he s played and haven t seen anything to suggest he s one of the strongest defenders around or did you not mean physically strong
Not sure if it was a foul by Mandzukic or not but the skill by Pogba and cross by Sandro were both excellent
Could have possibly been a foul but you ve got to expect your center back to be stronger than that
Heh that s exactly what the commentators just said
Does that mean I should be getting paid for this
Can t be worse than the clowns commentating now
Anyone have Pogba s drop on De Bruyne
So happy to see super Mario score
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot to me he s been the best player of the first half Now I just wish Khedira can stay healthy and keep Sturaro off the field
Sturaro was pretty damn good today He recovered so many balls
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot He has been for a while but Allegri is attached to Evra for his consistency and alleged defensive superiority
Pogba running like a gazelle
Great cross Mandatory comment about the coefficient
I think this is the third consecutive assist for Sandro Evra s been good but this guy is just better
what a cross from Sandro
Love Sandro I wish we could have attempted to get him He s been one of the most complete young left backs for a while
Funny that he underperformed in the last season here
Yes Indeed the young man is an excellent footballer
does Pogba ever celebrate
Beautiful cross in Deserved the goal
And sadly Sandro is always on the bench
Doubt he ll be there much from now on though
He got subbed off today to his second consecutive standing ovation from our fans He s definitely making a great case for himself and there s no doubt in my mind that he ll feature quite regularly from now on
great assists 2 games in a row also very solid in defense he s fighting for it
looked quite a bit like Baba s pass to Oscar yesterday Lovely ball
That cross couldn t have been more perfect
Pogba has been amazing so far in this match hoping he scores
I love how quickly goals appear on here
Alex Sandro s cross had eyes
The defense of De Bruyne on Pogba was just horrible He put himself between the ball and the sideline instead of the ball and the door
Great cross What happened to the defender there though
Otamendi choked hard
Mogo si se bacit na glavu
Yyyyyyeeesssss Way to step up mandzukic
What a cross
Makes me miss Darke for world cup games
Vintage poacher Mandzukic
Does Otamendi think he is Ronaldo
Great cross from pogba sandrp pogba is looking good so far in this match
Pogba didn t cross it The commentator even said Alex Sandro as he crossed the ball
Ohh corrected it thanks
Cross was by Alex SandroAccording to UEFA it was an Own Goal http www uefa com uefachampionsleague season 2016 matches round 2000634 match 2015739 index html

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsI expect Chelsea to improve marginally I have trouble seeing where the magic fairly dust that turns the clock back to last season comes from
You are what your record says you are Mahatma Ghandi
If you think I ve been unfair in mocking the Blues here s a neutral version to share with your Chelsea supporting friends https drive google com file d 0B ZcVoqtapgRNC1kT1RvbEZSYUk view usp sharing edit to add ugh does not display well in Sheets You ll have to use Excel
Hadn t planned on it but it should be easy Only problem is I don t know which supporters to pick on in other leagues p
If you beat Spurs this week I ll eat my hat Unrelated note I wear pizza as headgear
In isolation yeah catch any one of the teams ahead of you is plausible Catching all 11 of the teams in between Chelsea and 4th place well This seems beyond your grasp though I also give up p
This I agree with If the cups go toward the big fish Chelsea may well nick the EL Or if they win a cup themselves
Now that s a hot take
A lot of time and matches remain and Spurs still are a Harry Kane ACL away from a serious problem don t count your cockerels before they hatch
spits in hand offers to shake
The math nerds Ok Michael Caley and whoever does stats com put 4th on around 66 points the average is around 68 There s a lot of compression at the top since the appointed breakaway pack some subset of United City and or Arsenal has thus far refused to breakaway Plus also the computers are positively glitchy about Leicester They still have a lot of but it s Leicester in the model The models tend to weigh the previous seasons results and lessens it over time as the current season s results are factored in Frankly I don t trust the models regarding 4th place so I m inclined to agree with you If Leicester is s posed to be lower on the table that means that they points they do have have taken away from the other top clubs Gross oversimplifcation just happened So maybe we ll see a lower 4th place point total For reference the lowest in the 20 team era is 60 and the highest is 79
I ll take that bet if Chelsea do make the top 4 I ll eat a very spicy taco
I ll take a bet on either if you want
Or to put the Chelsea question in isolation What is your over under on total points for Chelsea this season
We ll see I like Everton to go on a tear I haven t watch enough Southampton to rule out a run and yeah West Ham is probably at their highwater mark If I were a betting man I d take the following clubs to finish higher than Chelsea Arsenal Man City Man United Spurs Liverpool Everton and yes Leicester Which four of those am I wrong on p And I have a newsflash Chelsea s not winning on Sunday p
It matters a lot because Chelsea is not the only candidate to make a huge run from the middlebottom of the table Everton looks good Liverpool looks good Southampton is well they may or may not come good it s hard to tell It does Chelsea no good to go on a massive run and achieve 68 points if 4th place is now 70 because someone got a hot hand 68 is not the finish line it s just a statistical point where half the 4th place team finished ahead of it kind of You are betting on Leicester falling back AND Spurs AND Everton AND Southampton AND Liverpool AND even the Hammers sure why not all dropping so many more points while Chelsea performs at last year s level suddenly and without any sort of reason to believe other than well belief I mean support your club and all but well yeah
Some other interesting things besides Chelsea p The bar gets even lower if 6th or even 7th are in the mix if the cups fall to high placed teams then the doors are open for Europa Everyone thinks Leicester will fall back to earth but I still like them for Europe Yes they have a daunting run to finish the front half but that just means they also have 13 matches reversed fixtures in their future where they glorped up 28 points on the first pass If they have another 25 28 points in them plus a few more around 7 9 from murderers row they can make 63 And if the top finishers get the cups they won t even need that many Leicester on Thursday nights What a world From West Ham to around Stoke if any of those teams go on a surge they are suddenly in play for nicking the last CL or the top EL spot It s wide open a few unexpected wins here or there Aston Villa are in deep shit DEEEEP shit They have 5 points in 13 matches 0 38 ppm They need to be more than 3 times better to get their nose into clean air I wonder what the lowest points after 13 matches that didn t get relegated was
Which is why I included the 80 target The math nerds on twitter agree that the champ this season might not make 80 whoever they are
I had that in but I dropped it maybe I should in future editions
Man City had one team to catch That team stumbled and City ran them down Chelsea has to eclipse 11 teams of 14 teams to claim fourth Sure they have almost 4 times as long to catch them as City did United but it s just too many clubs Plus they ve shown nothing on the pitch thus far that indicates there are a hair from making the switch from 1ppm to more than 2 1 ppm
I think it s sort of mad to consider it but if Chelsea can average 2 1 points per match for the rest of the way they ll have earned it no doubt
HHHHRRRGGGGAAAAHHHHH Oh sorry had a nightmare there for a second
I want Dembele with Dier maybe not as dynamic going forward although I think he s starting to get the value of passing forward p but Dembele is as smooth as butter on the ball and denying Chelsea a whiff of any takeaways up the pitch is quite valuable On Sunday I prefer Hugo Kyle Toby Jan Danny Mousa Eric Erik Christian Heung Min Harry It s not as dynamic as other options but it s stone cold hard defensively with enough up front to get the requisite 2 goals
Bah they were better than Norwich and Maccabi Tel Aviv Forgive me if Chelsea squashing bugs doesn t exactly fill me with dread When they ve played teams with some talent lately Loss to Stoke Loss to Liverpool Loss to Stoke on pens Loss to West Ham During that same span they got a win and a draw against Dinamo Kiev scoring a grand total of one goalibrahimovic substitution

Bayern or Barcelona the one with the less injuries

You can hover over a crest to see the team name
It s no surprise that Sandro getting more regular minutes has coincided with Mandzukic looking more dangerous He could prove to be an important striker for us this season
What does grass mean when used in this context
Omar s version including Pogba wrecking De Bruyne https streamable com 774n
Unfortunately not
Probably his best performance of the season
The people who say that are those who have only seen the Vines
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot He has been for a while but Allegri is attached to Evra for his consistency and alleged defensive superiority
That was headed for the corner flag
Oh come on put this game to bed already
Lo stile Juve
Bit selfish from Morata there He did the hard work but if he passes to Dybala there the game is over And right off the back if that Sterling nearly scores at the other end
To be fair he doesn t need to work on his attacking game too much to reach Gattuso s level
On loan though your point still stands
Yep we play it after every goal at home
It was
Sounds like it s the only game you ve ever seen
Morata nearly gifted them a goalscoring opportunity there

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsBeating Barca and Madrid was about the only noteworthy thing they did this season They ve been poor in the league too
saw today how good they can be What you mean go down by 4 goals Conceeding 3 goals in 10 minutes is much more indictative about how bad Madrid s defense is rather than how good Shakhtar is Especially considering the fact that Madrid have conceeded 10 goals in their last 3 games
That s becasue the whole league was affected by the war
Or maybe how the players are affected by the war You think it s a coincidence how many Brazilians are leaving the team They re afaird for a reason you know They had to fucking move stadiums and the club s owners are running out of cash to support the teams
I mentioned Ronaldo because the guy I was replying to talked about Ronaldo
lol Portugal and Netherlands
A win by BATE could send them through the R16 IMO Roma and Bayer have been shockingly poor this year I expected a lot better from them
I m not pinning it on anybody
Mate this is against a team in a war torn country He has dissappeared in all the big games this year Atletico Sevilla PSG Barca
lol these English commentators Sagna clearly got Dybala on the foot
Well upon future research it appears they went to Budapest instead of Bucharest and the final was in Bucharest Other than that it s true
If they re gonna rotate then why even start Ronaldo He needs the rest the most
I remember when this huge group of Athletic fans flew to Bucharest for the EL final Except that the final was in Budapest
all that means is that Bayern is a team full of chokers

Who s the outlier for United I know for Barca it s probably Messi Neymar and for Madrid it s Ronaldo but who s earning that much for United Rooney
Isn t Ribery still injured
Yeah just support Columbus then If you re looking for an European team just pick some team from the top leagues Spain Germany England Spain is perfect because the kickoff times aren t so damn early in the morning Go research stuff on Wikipedia and watch some La Liga games to decide Laola1 tv has free streams if you can get a German IP

That wasn t even a shot he was trying to settle it
I kind of wish we still had him
No you don t He has been dreadful
He just seems like a nice guy And I had hopes he could come good for us after his bad spell
We definitely do He was our only attacking midfielder that actually made runs in behind the defence and had a strikers instinst And he was an excellent finisher
The tense of this comment is bothering me more than it should
Why It s fine

Alves has had five great months of play in the past two years terrible from 2013 to mid January 2015 then he played to a world class level going into the Copa Am rica and his defending has been bad this season Only reason why he is still at Bar a is because they couldn t sign anyone else otherwise he would have left in January
cba watching the rest of this game i literally just saw Kobe brick an open fadeaway with 4 22 left in the third quarter and then Ezeli scored an alley oop 9 seconds later
Hibbert GOAT rim protector
honestly Kobe is being forced to take so many bad shots so many bad misses but the Lakers are AIDS
i assume this guy is in uni which means it definitely will take longer than 15 minutes the problem is that in most cases you have to absorb and analyze a lot of information and when you are limited to 450 words it s difficult to be concise whilst covering all the bases recently i had a business law assignment which was worth 20 of my grade it could only be 500 words it s difficult to really cut down from 750 words to 500 without losing key aspects of your arguments
Chuck is laughing but in his head he s like wtf bruh

OH MAN WHAT A GOALSo much room for activities
This is so bizzare it almost looks like a sabotage I can t believe manager would set them up like this
To make a point that the BBCJK can t all play
Exactly Its either a sabotage by Benitez so Perez stops interfering with tactics or its a sabotage by the players to get Benitez sacked Otherwise there s just no way any top team uses such a bad formation Even the most casual fan would notice something is terribly wrong
Bale Benzema Cristiano James Kroos
Aye
Did you hear about their line up in the game against Sevilla CDPRNMCKIBC
I find it hard to believe he did that s one strategy for taking the midfield battle out of the game s
That is some Moyes level failure right there
Surrendering the midfield from the start Bold move Let s see how it works for them Oh right Well then
Its perfect for Barca
This hurts to look at Still baffled how we went from an organized defensive team to that Sure its against the best team in the world right now but what a poor performance and utter lack of focus and organization Hope we can do better at the camp nou
Describing Madrid s formation
I can t understand how when real is attacking in possession Ronaldo Benzema and sometimes a third player are all within a radius of 4m of each other When on top of the above there is no one between the forwards and midfield defenders lines I am surprised they can still score as many goals as they do In fact they were already doing this last year with Ancelotti and Rafa just made it worse

You can t give creative players that much space
You cant give Stoke that much space
Exactly That wouldn t fly even in lower divisions
I didn t watch the game but this is just a snapshot isn t it I cant see that the team remained in that shape all game Surely
A team should never stand like that against a top tier team
aahh the good ol charcoal formation
Shoutout to Hennessy for the graphic
If I recall correctly in the early chapters of Tsubasa their rivals did this strat and it was effective I dont know what went wrong there
It reminds me of how we would sometimes end up looking under Moyes
poor benitez he came to italy and totally forgot how to football
Ah the classic 4 2 4 wide formation with Kroos and Modric as CBs
James such a good midfielder though right
He is He was one of the few players that were somewhat carrying real
I mean Barca were going to dominate the midfield anyway In some ways it is a good idea to not waste players by trying to compete with them in there
Because they re good you decide to give them more space
Modric Kroos James
How long will barcelona fans drag this out
About as long as that gap in your midfield
bravo just bravo
Great keeper
Had probably his best performance for Barca yet
I refuse to take anything seriously a Liverpool supporter says
Yes because the fact that he supports a lesser team than yours means his opinion doesn t matter

You just didI hope we will see a worthy clash between barca and bayern at their best
i don t think bayern will ever have robben and ribery on the pitch together again but those 2 being on the pitch might not even be their best team at this point
Costa is better than Ribery anyway
No he s not This is such a stupid thing to say
Not that I necessarily agree with him but Costa has been amazing
yeah but Robbery is a nightmare to play against
R bben is better
No Robbery is better because they steal points And in hindsight 49M total for that striking power is a steal too
of course he is He has been playing just as good as prime Ribery since he got to Bayern Current Ribery wouldn t get off the bench with Costa on his current form
just as good as prime Ribery What s it like having a memory span of one year
It proves that right now Costa appears to be the more productive choice Ribery has lost a step it happens to all players eventually
Ribery has lost a step Ribery was absolutely bonkers last season And no one knows if he lost a step because of his current injury He will return soon Maybe already in 3 weeks
The point I m debating was that as of yet Costa is not better than Ribery in his prime Perhaps better than Ribery now
Ribery has never had this much impact in his career
Had 7 assists and 5 goals in the small handful of matches he actually played last season Bundesliga specifically You have to be trolling
Cool random stats
Oh god please leave
that s my point everyone was pissed that bayern were missing ribery and robben against barca now it doesn t matter
Well Robben is important they are much more dangerous with him Ribery isn t
this would be amazing
There s not much between both teams just now Barca have been excellent for a few matches but Bayern have been consistently excellent At the same time it feels like Barcelona have done their homework and ironed out their early season problems The extra motivation might give Bayern the edge too after Barcelona beat them last year
and then there s the fucking almighty augsburg

It s a popular song from an old german kids theatre from Augsburg that was very popular in the TV and it s the goal song of the FC Augsburg We also don t give a wimpel before the game but a puppet from that theatre Lovely club that one
Been to the puppenkiste museum last year after going to the christmas market Had to rewatch Urmel aus dem Eis and Bill Bo after that
I went three years ago with my little brother my then still alive grandmother and my mother Damn that was a lovely day was so close to buy a fully fledged Jim the Lokf hrer puppet for 70 And the only time I have seen a professional footballer was Bobadilla a fewe weeks later getting drunk on the christmas market Good times I miss that city so much
Every time there s a discussion about Augsburg on this subreddit or r borussiadortmund I can count on you being there Why did you leave
Why did I leave what
Augsburg You talk about it so fondly that I m curious about what led to you moving away
I finished my bachelors the masters there was not for me and most people that made that place what it was for me left So I wanted to see how much I like other places Turns out that I wasn t imagening it when I thought that those four years where the best time I will ever have And I will always remember it fondly Maybe even move back there one day who knows Augsburg shouldn T go below second league though that s a requiremend
Jim Button and Lukas the Train Conductor to be precise
Wtf were we doing
Should ve never won that game to begin with

Everyone has to visit the dentist
And no one enjoys it Except for Augsburg
Well Augsburg did lose in the last minute so they might not have enjoyed it that much
The dentist was nice to them for the whole trip and then he just ripped out the tooth They were definitely in pain
We didn t enjoy the wrong penalty call But we enjoyed the match
I m with you on that Hate winning that way would ve rather taken a draw against The Parked Buss of Augsburg
Just wait until Mainz makes Bayern look like a bunch of amateurs yet again
Like they often do Fucking Mainz
I dont know much of the german league why other teams are not even close is about resources why is Bayern in a different league than the rest of the teams
Bayern right now would comfortably whoop every other league aside from La Liga They have a gulf of talent across world football not just their own league
Bayern are not all that much better than the top teams in spain england italy or psg ON THEIR DAY The thing is that bayern are so consistent comparatively They have been making far fewer mistakes than the other top teams in europe
Consistency is what seperates the best from the rest Arsenal can beat Bayern on their day and we do but we d get battered 4 times out of 6
Correct That it what i just said
And I m just pointing out why that makes them much better than the top teams in England Italy PSG
Fair enough i guess i just thought i portrayed that when i said ON THEIR DAY We agree then Consistency separates them Cheers
Yeah ressources Bayern can compete with the best because of ridiculously good marketing TV money is a joke compared to Spain or even England I would wager that Suarez Neymar and Messi make more money than all of Borussia Dortmund first eleven combined
There s not much TV money spread around the league but Bayern has done well to market to supporters globally that other teams haven t gotten close to Having an amazingly consistent success rate in recent years and having some of the most famous NT players certainly helps the appeal Bayern also has been incredible well managed and received consistent growth where other German clubs squandered their potential in the past Lastly once Bayern solidified their place in the top clubs worldwide the income was solidified as well causing further gap in the BL
Holy mother of fuck
Their home record in the CL is even more impressing
Pep likes his funky formations
And that s why I hope that if we meet Madrid or Barca in the CL before the final it will be a home game first as opposed to an away game
Why where there 24 more seats on the first 2 matches
Corporate boxes probably
Curious to see if they can keep it up when Europe s elite come visiting
Barcelona Arsenal Dortmund
When did they meet Barca this season And Arsenal and Dortmund aren t part of Europe s elite anymore
Hey now
Dortmund especially this season are better than most teams in the CL regardless it d be deluded to say otherwise
Might get far in the EL true
Oh whoops I thought I was on the post about our last 9 home CL games
Yeah Well to be honest neither is Ajax if Arsenal is not sorry I actually love Ajax
Ajax hasn t been part of the European elite for nearly 15 years now maybe longer Money talks
For me Ajax is not in European elite this season But they are usually I usually have high expectations from Ajax because I love Ajax very merry much
he s right they haven t been a mighty European side for a long time last time they got to QF of UCL is 2002 03
Yeah I know I still do not want to admit it

One team league

I think he meant that Bayern are so good that no other teams can match them But its the same circle jerk bullshit that people are taking shit about PSG and as a Celtic fan I hear it plenty too
Don t see what that has to do with his comment
one team league multiple leagues
Ok makes sense I guess I just think u vaginawishbone was trying to say that the Bundesliga is a one team league I ll let you decide if it is or not

Stindl was outstanding Absolutely brilliant signing for Gladbach from what I ve seen of him so far
That one seems to be better At least for now thank you
I don t even know what it is I have usual download rates but nothing s working for me So frustrating
There s actually not a single stream working for me at the moment so I m just gonna update the most important things now My apologies
Also didn t work for me I think I have a stable one now EDIT As I type that it freezed again
Every stream is dying for me right now can t update at the moment ffs
Yeah you could be right I don t even know but I think Badstuber Boateng as build up is something that could work But I m no Pep
Not really a natural DM could be used there though
No defensive midfielder Build up by Boateng and Badstuber important today Oh yeah and Badstuber s back
This is a rather special situation so I don t know if it s really necessary Either way I m the newest mod and thus not really the one to already recruit new mods P But you may be right let s see how the next weeks are looking
u somelatinguy isn t here for the week and neither is u fleckes I don t really have to do much with the player ratings and I m also not having a lot of time at the moment just got back home If you re still feel like putting up a pre match thread it s rather late I know sorry feel free to put one up However there will be a Match Thread and a Post Match Thread tonight including ratings Sorry guys but it seems like all of the mods aren t having a ton of time at the moment It should get back to normal on the weekend though so don t worry
Since u TheHylianJebus can t thank himself I d like to say thank you for taking my Match Thread and creating a great Post Match Thread as well Danke
Literally just for fun and to say hello Confirmed The last paragraph is the most idiotic one though Football fans aren t criminals yeah right you bunch of fucking retards
I don t know At least I already know that I m fucked when I meet the Zulus But if I manage to become friends with them I m pretty safe as Shaka has the highest loyalty level of any civ in the game Rome on the other hand always fucks you over sooner or later even if you are friends with each other
Deutsch ist manchmal auch in Deutschland selbst eine schwere Sprache Immer weiter so
Aktuell schwer Wird sich aber auch bei mir wieder legen liegt wohl daran dass ich vor einigen Monaten selbst in Paris war und die Dinge die ich dort als sch n in Erinnerung habe jetzt einen dunklen Unterton bekommen Es ist nicht wirklich Angst im eigentlichen Sinne sondern viel mehr Wut und Trauer
Krass Find s halt brutal wie der Terror jetzt auch Deutschland erreicht Vor allem so wie du s erz hlst Ich hab mich aber auch brutalst mit dem Thema auseinander gesetzt Der Mensch f hlt sich halt zu dem was ihn ver ngstigt hingezogen Darum hab ich viel zu viel ber Paris gelesen und auch gesehen
Wie geht s euch eigentlich so nach den Paris Anschl gen und der Evakuierung in Hannover Habt ihr Angst Ehrlich gesagt w rde ich l gen wenn ich sagen w rde dass das alles bei mir nichts ausl st Versp re schon etwas Angst um da mal bei der Wahrheit zu bleiben Andererseits sollte man sich solidarisch und die Terroristen nicht gewinnen lassen aber das f llt mir aktuell schwer

works fine
Bayern or Barcelona the one with the less injuries
His teams does not play spectacular football but the results are decent He has never been fired or relegated and made pretty good things with small teams Bastia Saint Etienne in Ligue 2 Nice

They sold their best players while offering new expansive contracts to average players and they built a new expansive stadium who is not profitable
Pique would have done the calma calma then the siiiiiiii celebration and then he would have spent the last minutes with his right hand opened to show the manita
CamaradonaSorry man I know you want to praise your defender but if Sterling put that on target either to Buffon s left or right that would have gone in It was a terrible miss from Sterling no defending could have saved you there

Felix Brych is such a terrible referee woeful calls all across the game Edit Every fucking year as well God fucking damnit
What A Goal
Anybody have any idea what s going on with Hart
Feeling a red card coming The players are getting fed up with it all
Unable to go back since I m relying on other people s streams Normally I would be able to go back into the match to grab that for you but now tonight Sorry mate

Maybe try selecting a role for him in that position that s what I do So instead of CM Playing position select CM Central Midfielder That s what I do when I want to re train my player and it seems to help
He s still at United in 2018 in my save Getting decent amount of apps but not a key player United did buy Kane in their first season so they play him instead
Getting no yellows is pretty difficult thing to do Your players will make tactical fouls and or lose their head and make rash challenges It s pretty much impossible to not get carded at least once in a game
Can I see your squad I m currently playing with Gent and I m only in 2018 so I m still struggling a bit
Get Zabaleta
HOLY SHIT BOYS THEY DID IT Belgium is proud of you
Pretty fucking stupid that two four steps are guarded
That first minute red card though
Probably Pardew
Fuck I didn t get Bolasie s skill that lost him the ball in itreally interesting read I didn t know about van Gaal breaking his leg
I love how he done it
That s somehow so very van Gaal to suddenly take up pole vaulting as a hobby
Great article Thanks for sharing
Injuries suck so much
Grear read funny to see all of the coindicences
TIL
Season cut Shaw t Fucking excellent hahaShame he wasted his career winning everything with Barcelona he could have taken us to Championship glory
He would certainly have added strength to our sub s bench
Sure he d have got into a midfield of Nicky Bailey and Kevin Thompson
He never proved himself in the Champ but neither did Kev who was always injured Bailey was alright Robson was the real guy to displace
Always had a soft spot for Tarmo Kink Should ve kept him just for advertising Parmo s
Loved Kink remember him scoring a double against Burnley shortly after we got him very decent player
I fucking love it when Estonian players get praise
The Estonian Exocet What a left foot Shame he was so incredibly hit or miss
Mate he s the Tallin Torpedo Remember one match after he scored his first screamer for the club he came on in the last few minutes literally everyone in the stands was saying he would fire one in from range What did he go and do fire one in from range
Thomson is a quality player would have done a lot if not for horrible injuries
Spent his career at a team who couldn t even dream of winning the Football League Championship Shame indeed
Heres some quotes from the article that this article is referencing Xavi is a genuine football fanatic I interview players all the time You and Jamie Carragher are the biggest football addicts I have met I met Carragher on a beach in Ibiza when we were on holiday What did you talk about Football He s a good guy a fanatic You can see that He came back to Spain to interview me I bet I could ask you about lower level teams in Spain and you d know Ibiza from the second division Ibiza are now in the third Barakaldo a tiny Basque team with a beautiful stadium They re leader of one of the four Segunda B leagues Look shows his phone I read about all the leagues every day Alaves Near the top of the second Gaizka Toquero has got five goals so far Huesca Near the bottom of the second Regional fourth division club San Andreu Mid table Started well I have friends at these clubs I follow how they do Cornella who play next to Espanyol is another I follow the Belgian second division because there are players from the Aspire Academy there What about lower level English football I follow Middlesbrough because Aitor Karanka is there Brighton are top of their league I met a boy the other day English He was wearing a Barca shirt but I asked him who he supported He said Sheffield United I know them they have 20 000 fans in the third division That s incredible You get that in England I watched some of a game with Charlton the other day There was football on television yet the stadium was packed with supporters Incredible If that was in Catalonia Olot vs Reus then there were would be a few people there and the families of the players Heres a link to the full article
Xavi s wife must be so fed up with him
well actually When I have time I d love to do the same but I think my wife would kill me Can you imagine OK you stay with the baby for three days while I go and watch Liverpool against Everton
haha he said it because he talked about Luis Enrique before he became a trainer that he used to go and watch teams and he used to wear a scarf so he was not recognized
that sounds awesome wish i had the money to travel around europe watching all the best derbies out there
Didn t he break up with his previous girlfriend and basically say well at least I can finally watch all the football I want
Xavi didn t date anyone for a while in order to be free from distraction and focus on football
Xavi and Carra seem like such an unusual combination Hopefully they both find their way into management at some point
Imagine carra trying out a bit of Spanish with a scouse accent
Me yamo carra
Sounds good to me
I ve heard it It s not so bad The real odd one was a very strong Welsh accent combined with near fluent Spanish of the Spain variety It was quite odd To be fair both were better than Chileans haha
You re basically describing what Angel Rangel is going to be like at the end of his career
Joint managers of Catalunya
El Clasico 2035 Xavi in charge of Barca vs Carragher in charge of Madrid
So knowledgeable What a guy imagine he ends up coaching Middlesborough
i m not sure my heart could take the pride
Holy shit how does he have so much time to follow all these leagues amazing Can t wait to see him training Barca some day I hope Lucho stays until Xavi arrives
What else does he have to do Footbalers are usually free most if the day after they finish training
I mean I imagine that after a long day of doing nothing but playing thinking about football and fitness you might want to do something non football related Like go mushroom hunting
It sounds like he just looks at the tables and reads articles
Yes I watch a lot of football Madrid are very strong this season They have a different philosophy to Barca They work a lot on their defence Rafa Benitez has improved that snigger
What s the Aspire Academy
Qatari football factory Foreigners go in NT players come out
That s by far the best definition for it African and Asian players training to make it into the 2022 Qatari NT
Football academy in Qatar where Xavi is studying
Best football academy in Qatar IIRC
I m Mallorquin and I didnt even know Ibiza got relegated
What a legend I miss him so much
That is such an incredible interview I wish there would be more revealing interviews like this where we get to read about player s experience in historical events and their insights towards football in general and certain players in particular
Brighton are top of their league INCORRECT Clearly Xavi knows nothing about football
they Sheffield Utd have 20 000 fans in the third division That s incredible You get that in England I watched some of a game with Charlton the other day There was football on television yet the stadium was packed with supporters Incredible If that was in Catalonia Olot vs Reus then there were would be a few people there and the families of the players How can anybody say English football has no identity
huh who said that
Vicente Del Bosque
Totally out of context He wasn t talking about the fans at all He was talking about the English way of playing football vs the Italian Spanish insert any country here s way of playing football And he s right Those times when you could recognize the nationality of a team by the way they played is over Take Arsenal and Chelsea for instance Totally opposite ways of playing yet in the same league There s no English Spanish or Italian identity in terms of playing anymore or at least that identity is getting much more vague
Take Barcelona and Atleti and you have the same disparity in play style
Absolutely yes Which is precisely my point
Pretty sure he was talking about the style teams play with when he said that
In what context
He s a cretin
What a glory hunter
Dags and Red or nuffin m8
Xavi should come help us out so those 20k fan aren t pissed because we lose 4 2 at home to fucking Shrewsbury Town Fuck
Big Nigel s doing a fantastic job
Curse of the Nigels To be fair it can t just be him We ve got a massive squad full of crap bought for a lot of money Our entire behind the scenes finance board is very opaque so no one has any idea who s actually making the final decisions on stuff I m pretty depressed seeing you lot doing so well too Football s pretty shit right now
What s happening with McGahey
Sent on loan to Tranmere God knows why our whole defence is shit might as well give him a try
What about Che Adams and Louis Reed Your squad is full of young talent sorry if I m kind of rubbing it in at the moment
Adams got injured and is finding his feet again Reed was one of the offenders last night got subbed at half time Both are really talented though Reed seems to have become a bit too relied upon for my liking though it s a fair bit of pressure for him especially when the others in midfield aren t playing well
Xavi s just trying to get in the next Sean Bean movie
LORD OF THE GRASS
Not surprised to hear him say this always thought he had his head screwed on right
He would have been dead proud of United s fans last night singing your not fit to wear the shirt 40 minutes in
The Lane s not the happiest at the moment
I can understand why you would have been promoted by now if you kept Danny Wilson
I was behind Wilson got some unnecessary stick off the fans C est la vie
Will be even more impressive next season when we re drawing 20k in the fourth division
The more I read about Xavi the more I like him He seems like such a nice guy
He is a genuine football fanatic follows third division teams all over the world I can t wait until he coaches his first team I think it s inevitable that he will become a coach
let s hope so his football brain is immense
Which is crazy to think how smart Lahm must be then Pep worked with both and made a huge point how smart Lahm was
Let s hope he successfully managed a first division team
Obviously I hope he coaches Barca one day
Mhm I m just nervous cause sometimes highly successful ex players turned managers due fairly poorly
He seems nice a good leader but from what I ve seen he also seems like a sore loser
Ferguson always scouted for the sorest of sore losers they were the ones that fought the hardest on the field
you re really determined not to find fault in Xavi lol
heh not really I m just trying to point out that for many football players their biggest asset is that they are sore losers
Except even among the realm of top class footballers Xavi is noticed as being a sore loser So it cant be that
So is Mourinho So is Ronaldo Are you saying this because of the grass length comments he d make
Not that nice a guy https www reddit com r soccer comments 3bfwxk xavi qatar has conditions for great world cup
I m just saying if someone gave me millions I too would blindly praise them for everything
yeah but you probably aren t already a multi millionair
But they can get good infrastructure due to money
Really He s said and done a lot of things recently to put me off him
really s top lad
What a football nerrrrrrd one of us
I m sure he writes for Zonal Marking under a pseudonym
Why is Xavi such a cool guy
Xavi is the ultimate hipster
Would he be impressed by this blavdes fan https twitter com Oddschanger status 669531006769213441
Xavi is a fantastic player and genuine football fanatic but I must say the whole Qatar ambassador thing is very disappointing and on the same note Barcelona s Qatar Airways deal is quite depressing as well
Have to think that Juninho and Ravenelli had something to do with that
Great Another what Xavi said post
Too much Xavi last days
Xavi to Middlesbrough confirmed
Mate he wouldn t make it into our midfield
Who needs Xavi with Big Grant bossing it
Banned for Huddersfield though isn t he I suppose we can arrange a tryout deal for this Xavi guy
Oh no you ll really struggle to beat us now s
Poor man s Adam Clayton
Fuck it we ll have him
Middlesborough Never heard of them Except something about a tragedy involving Liverpool fans
Oh you re painfully American I get it
What
Wow you re thick as fuck
Jesus fucking christ
HillsboroughReally After what they did on Roberto and Rafinha
Out of curiosity do you follow the Turkish football in general and or support a team in Super Lig as your second team to Atleti
Messi vs Manchester City
Some fake ass bromance IMO
I d go as far as say that even Arbeloa would be a better replacement for Carvajal if the latter can t play for some reason than Danilo Porto are laughing their asses of for robbing Madrid 30M

Much credit to Bale for Cristiano s goal
Guys how s Kovacic been so far in this game
Kovacic himself said he s much better as a DM than as a offensiv midfielder higher up on the field Don t really think he ll be a success in the game

Wake me up the day Cristiano do the same for BaleHe s back guys He didn t rapidly decline die or some other shit He s okay
He didn t want to score till Messi started scoring
I miss Messi its not fair if hes out injured and I keep scoring Ill just lay low for a bit until he s back
The Kneejerk is real
He was briefly less than superhuman but even that was scary enough for him to get back to form
He obviously did decline but since the last game found the fountain of youth He s getting better so must have reversed the ageing process it s the only explanation I mean that maybe a few bad games happens to everyone and just because you re over 29 doesn t mean a few bad games means the end of your career
I still think he s declining

He d have about 6 inches of height over him that s not even a debate
Messi is 5 7 Cr7 is 6 1 6 inches your math checks out
he s the all time top scorer in the champions league without penalties most goals in a season is also his without penalties i imagine there could be at least one more but those two i m rather positive about

That has been opta thing from the get go
They usually use words that actually have relevance to what the stat is about But motivated seems like it was just randomly chosen
Not really in the news today it was reported he d promised to work harder etc in the team meeting after the Clasico so obviously they are going with the idea that Real are extra motivated for today s game after Saturday s embarrassment
Only Benzema Ozil and Di Maria have assisted Cristiano more than Bale
OptaJose 2015 11 25 20 38 UTC 21 Gareth Bale has assisted in Cristiano s 21 goals only three players did it more times Benzema 31 zil 27 and Di Mar a 22 Duet This message was created by a bot Contact creator Source code
Reports of his demise have been greatly exaggerated
Mate this is against a team in a war torn country He has dissappeared in all the big games this year Atletico Sevilla PSG Barca
what the hell does war torn have to do with it You realize that the game today was played in Lviv a city on the complete opposite end of the country from where the conflict is taking place right Ukraine is a very big country It s not like they had to worry about bombs being dropped on the stadium It s amazing how far people go to discredit Ronaldo s achievements
Or maybe how the players are affected by the war You think it s a coincidence how many Brazilians are leaving the team They re afaird for a reason you know They had to fucking move stadiums and the club s owners are running out of cash to support the teams
It didnt affect them in the Ukrainian league they have only dropped something like 2 points since August
That s becasue the whole league was affected by the war

I think you are being ignorant and unfair towards Shakhtar They are extremely strong at home and its incredibly difficult to beat them Many big teams in last few years have been unable to do that And we saw that today how good they can be
saw today how good they can be What you mean go down by 4 goals Conceeding 3 goals in 10 minutes is much more indictative about how bad Madrid s defense is rather than how good Shakhtar is Especially considering the fact that Madrid have conceeded 10 goals in their last 3 games
Doesn t change the fact that shakhtar are good at home
so did the team don t pin it on one player
He s not pinning it on one player Ronaldo played shit in all of those games not talking about the rest of the team
Ronaldo played shit but so did Bale Kroos Ramos Benzema etc are they all fastly declining too
No because you don t usually decline as a 26 27 year old top level player Ronaldo is nearly 31 and when he plays bad he essentially isn t there
what does age have to do with it if anything it s his knee problem that has limited his dribbling compared to the past but Ronaldo didn t go from scoring 66 goals and getting 22 assists last season to becoming useless this season in the space of 3 months even when he is playing like shit he can still give chances for teammates and create space for others with his movement just because he isn t dribbling past multiple players it doesn t mean he isn t doing anything useful the only problem this season has been that he is isolated as striker and his finishing has been bad also factor that his teammates have been invisible in most big matches too
Age has a lot to do with it come on I know that Ronaldo is a crazy fit guy but sooner rather than later later his physicality will decline Also 61 goals and 21 assists Also Declining being useless ffs It means he s not playing to his standards He s been realtively worse even in his worse form than he was before
yes in 2 or 3 years he will no longer be RM quality but as of now he is definitely good enough to make a difference in any match as long as everyone around him doesn t disappear like against Sevilla and Barca I get what you re trying to say though but it came across as you calling him useless in the original comment by saying essentially isn t there
15 goals in 17 games this season while having a short run of his worst form in years Not to mention the entire team has been playing like crap and there have been an endless amount of injuries Must be tough to life up to your peoples standards
How many games has he scored in And name the teams Ronaldo plays well when the whole team plays well and sometimes he plays bad when the team aren t up to it
15 goals in 17 games is still a record 99 of players want to have at the top level
I m not pinning it on anybody
He has dissappeared in all the big games You re making it sound like his team is playing great but he s letting them down or some shit
I mentioned Ronaldo because the guy I was replying to talked about Ronaldo
they are actually in some damn good form if you actually take into consideration their form but hey fuck that
deleted
I think i understand that part doesn t change the fact that they re playing very good
the boy is growing up
Eh Wrong I think I seem to remember him getting 2 assists away at Schalke in 2014
In the 6 1 win no Cristiano had 2 goals and 1 assist Bale 2 goals and 1 assist Benzema 2 goals and 2 assists and Ramos one assist

I hope we do renew his contract Best destroyer in the world
does he even play that much
He s still a starter although he doesn t play midfield under Pep
He did yesterday I hope it becomes more routine It probably will considering Boateng Benatia and Badstuber are all healthy
It will I think a lot of the stuff the fans see Pep also sees It s why I like him He knows what needs to be done and he does it He s smart about it though He doesn t rush into things He wants to make sure that the players are all healthy before he makes moves again He moved Lahm to RB and he ll move Martinez to CDM again Martinez is regaining confidence though When he first came back he was definitely not ready to play in the midfield He looked afraid to dribble He ll get there though
Typically Bayern managers have fallen into two archetypes pragmatic and not idealistic idealistic and not pragmatic Not to say I don t appreciate them but Klinsmann and Van Gaal fell into the former while Rehhaggel Trappatoni Hitzfeld fell into the latter In his last stint Heynckes was the first manager in a long time to maintain a sense of style whilst tweaking the philosophy to achieve the best results The more you look at Heynckes career as a player and a manager the more remarkable it becomes and I ve never even been a zealous admirer of him He went from stubborn Osram to a man who adapted and changed at an old age That kind of transformation is seen rarely in anyone especially not one as decorated as him And I think Pep has really taken cues from that Yes Guardiola is highly intelligent and he wants to win more than anything But let s be real here he s always been an idealist and it s hard to imagine him ever abandoning a possession system and playing like stoke But it s year 3 and he is still constantly modifying his starting XI and tactics because a for rotation and b because he knows that the best results have not been achieved yet and he ll keep searching for the best tactic for his team I hope he signs that fucking contract or imma kill him
Well that took a dark turn at the end
How s Badstuber doing these days
He just got back from injury got subbed in against Stuttgart two weeks ago Was in the starting XI against Olympiacos yesterday and got a red card Not really a justified red card in my opinion but I m biased so you gotta decide for yourself
Just got back from injury
Didn t get to watch the second half how d he look in midfield
Couldn t really tell the match wasn t hard at all so he got to coast pretty much
He s no2 CB with Boateng And plays over Benatia
Benatia and him rotate although he s recently been starting more often over him probably due to form injury issues I guess you can say they re kinda joint starters it s just that neither of them is clear cut above the other Kinda like MaTS and Bravo at Barca except Javi and Benatia aren t exclusively alternated between the league and the cup
And Badstuber is still injured Who will move on first
Badstuber played yesterday Not the entire game though since he got a red after an hour
since he got a red after an hour I like to call that one a substitution with a handicap to even the playing field
Ya to be honest though it was a fitness problem with Badstuber He wasn t as fast as he should have been and the guy went down and he got sent off
Badstuber was never fast
it s just that neither of them is clear cut above the other I d say Martinez is easily a cut above Benatia which doesnt come as a surprise because the latter didn t have much chance to play with the team for a longer period without injuries
It s hard to say Bayern haven t had four fit CBs for more than a handful of games under Pep and its usually closer to two Between Benatia Badstuber and Martinez it s usually a safe bet that 1 2 of them are injured at any given time At the start of this season all three were actually injured and Boateng played the entire defense himself and in one game was subbed out leaving just Xabi to cover the entire back line The most you can say is that Boateng is a permanent fixture His partner or two depending on whether it s a 3 or 4 man backline varies a lot He could be paired with any of the three other CBs or even Alaba and Rafinha who sometimes play as makeshift CBs too Pep is all about that flexibility
They have to keep him he was insanely good when they won the CL Just needs to stay healthy for a while
If they could start him in the midfield that would be greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
Yeah I would so love to see a midfield of Martinez Vidal Thiago
Pep please
more like Thagio please
Bist du besoffen Deine komplette comment history schaut so aus als ob ein 14 j hriger dies alles geschrieben h tte
Der ist leider immer so
I can t even imagine the conniption Athletic fans have whenever they pop on a Bayern CL match to check in on Javi and he s chilling in his own half with Boateng
chilling in his own half with Boateng Dude have you seen our matches lately The only one chilling in our half is Neuer and even that just barely
that vocabulary tho
Is conniption not like a word people use
I mean my friends think I have a huge vocabulary and it s not something I ve ever uttered I meant it as a compliment haha Edit unless you re being sarcastic and I missed it
It s a common enough word in Ireland it means hissy fit
Also common in West Virginia Irish immigrants maybe
Chilling in the centre circle you mean CB have to stay in the other half under Pep or no chocolate
Javi was among the main reasons why we won the CL His presence in midfield was nothing short of staggering It was as if there were three of him Edit Yes please
He has to get back in midfield Simple as that
I love you Javi
Come to Arsenal please
Every thread yada yada
It s cool just throw me a downvote
You can t have all the playmakers and cdms in world gooners
not having any dms is one of the main things that s been fucking them the last few years tbf
He would be a dream signingGeorge Best top 10 goals according to some dude on youtube
in 2 his running dribbling style looks so alike to Messi P S anyone notice Mr Bean s car
The change of pace is amazing Also your flair is amazing
Thank you
Pat Jennings save at the start as well Us Northern Irelander s should have done more with those two surely
Worse teams have won more with worse players See Denmark 92 and Greece 04
Some of the tackles flying in are brutal
Goal number 10 was nuts Half of the players today would still be rolling if that had happened them
So many long balls
Boga jonito
I feel like those first few goals would have been rated much higher had they been in color
Obligatory George Best quotes If you d given me the choice of going out and beating four men and smashing a goal in from thirty yards against Liverpool or going to bed with Miss World it would have been a difficult choice Luckily I had both I spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered I used to go missing a lot Miss Canada Miss United Kingdom Miss World In 1969 I gave up women and alcohol it was the worst 20 minutes of my life On the pizza gate incident between Manchester United and Arsenal That s what children do throw food That s not fighting We were real men We d have chinned them On having blood transfusion after a liver transplant I was in for 10 hours and had 40 pints beating my previous record by 20 minutes I used to dream about taking the ball round the keeper stopping it on the line and then getting on my hands and knees and heading it into the net When I scored against Benfica in the 1968 European Cup final I nearly did it I left the keeper for dead but then I chickened out I might have given the boss a heart attack On Eric Cantona I d give all the Champagne I ve ever drunk to be playing alongside him in a big European match at Old Trafford On Cristiano Ronaldo There have been a few players described as the new George Best over the years but this is the first time it s been a compliment to me And my favourite now They ll forget all the rubbish when I ve gone and they ll remember the football If only one person thinks I m the best player in the world that s good enough for me
And of course George Best was the greatest player in the world Pele
The Pele comparison one anyone remembers In which he would say somewhere along the lines of if he is not that beautiful then he would have achieved more than Pele
This one I think If I had been born ugly you would have never heard of Pel
Yeah look like this But I don t think this is the exact wordings
Is that Ronaldo one true He could only have seen Ronaldo in his first couple of years at United way before he looked like he d become a truly world class player
There are some videos of Ronaldo s first couple of seasons 2014 Ronaldo could be as effective as 2004 Ronaldo with 1 3 of the trickery but you never knew exactly what 2004 Ronaldo would do Edit At least once he d finished his stepovers
I had the once in a lifetime chance to play against George Best and some other UK footballers in 1976 I lived in Torrance California and played youth football since 1966 at the local parks and then in the AYSO I went to High School with Sigi Schmid and Marine Cano ex goalkeeper for TB Rowdies and in 1976 I was at El Camino College in Torrance using the weight room facilities on a Saturday morning in February I was in training for a shot at a berth in the 76 Olympics but in another sport when a friend sees me and knowing I played soccer came into the weight room and told me there was a pick up game on the football practice field and they were looking for more players I was going to decline but then he told me that Rod Stewart was there so off I headed It wasn t just Rod Stewart but also Elton John and and some other expats playing with some other English expats and a good part of the LA Aztec team Pre Season was just around the corner and everybody was trying get the poundage off But I was young and really really fit and was outrunning every body most of the English players I think that year the Aztecs has like a 20 23 man roster and 17 of them were from the UK I hadn t played any organized soccer in 3 years and just kicked around with friends over a year ago but as soon as the rust fell off and I got my feet from under me I started playing better good enough to be asked to come back as a practice player Many NASL teams had unsigned player they had practice with I has to sign some kind of waiver but in turn they paid for a medical insurance policy for me and all training players I played for about 4 5 weekends and a few weekdays before I had to leave for more specialty training in my own sport I remember after I left Terry Fisher the coach of the Aztecs asked about me When I came back from the overseas later that year I was told the Georgie had opened a bar called Besties in Hermosa Beach by the pier on Hermosa Ave When I walked in he was BEHIND the bar LOL but he even remembered me called me a gddam idjet mucker and gave me a pint George was his best customer and he would often take a stack of bar business cards walk down to the beach and pier and hand them out to every good looking bird in a bikini for a free drink and he never cared if they were legal age or not If they were pretty they deserved at least a beer NONE of these girls knew who he was but about 3 out of four a took up the offer and the bar was always filled with birds and also bird watcher who ended up buying a lot of drinks that kept the bar afloat He had an apartment on the beach about a block away George never drove especially in the US but always had someone drive home As drunk as he sometimes got he was usually at every practice on time He really loved football and a hangover was no excuse One of my most prized possessions was an old photo I had taken with me and my girlfriend with Rod Stewart Elton John and George Best I never made the Olympic Team but I did graduate from college and went on to work in Washington DC for an agency that is called now The National Geo Spatial Intelligence Agency and when I moved back to DC I found out my soon to be ex girlfriend had poached that picture along with two T shirts we got from a Battle of the Bands at Redondo Beach Veterans Park of a band we played against called Mammoth as the pimply faced lead guitarist gave to us because he thought my girlfriend was hot Mammoth may not ring a bell but I m sure the name they took later Van Halen would But even though the Tshirts and photos were lost the memories will never be and they sound even better when you talk about your Glory Days But I ll never forget George Best that g ddam idjet mucker for the rest of my days
Time to post this atrocity Awful defending awful commentary static offside line referee wearing the number 8 for some reason it s like a parallel universe
How many times are they going to say the word soccer
Greatest saahker goal I ve ever seen
sigh not much has changed
Those were dark times
Before the Empire
I ll forgive it all because there s cheerleaders American cheerleaders they re they re just great
They look like they re having seizures or throwing a temper tantrum NASL in 70s was a fucking joke

The saying s much older than youtube
That was the banner that hung in Belfast during his funeral procession
Also it should never be forgotten that it is the tenth anniversary of the death of rallying legend Richard Burns FIFA and RBR it is for tonight
As if anyone needs an excuse for a bit of Richard Burns Rally
I m down
I had no idea You d have thought it would be everywhere here in Belfast with memorial stuff but nah nothing R I P Georgie
Yeah normally they are good at remembering things from the past over here at least we have the Airport
Hahahaha yeah
Well there s a mural of him over on Sandy Row You could call over in your hoops jersey and lay a wreath if you fancied it There was another one out East somewhere but that was painted over to be replaced by a paramilitary one which understandably kicked up a fuss
I well i know about the mural but you think you d have heard something today about it being the 10th anniversary
Im more surprised its only been 10 years Feels so long ago I think they still have a mural up the Cregagh near his childhood house
It s very strange seeing someone reddit referencing the Cregagh
It seems like weeks ago to me
I actually served him drinks in 88 while working at a club opposite Granada Studios He was making the show Best Marsh The Perfect Match and Tony Wilson brought them in for lunch
RIP George
Greatest player to come out of Ireland Most naturally gifted United player You can t teach or learn what Best could do
Isn t it funny how all the most shining eulogies in British football are reserved for players who burnt out early and became complete pissheads Best Le Tiss Gazza etc
I admit Le Tiss had his fair share of McDonalds but i ve never known of any allegation of Alcoholism on his part And maybe a bit bias but he had a pretty average length career retired at 33 due to injury Not exactly the hardest worker but putting him in that category seems a tad harsh
Judging by his Countdown appearances last month Le Tiss is doing fine and is a much smarter guy than anyone would have suspected
He was never an alcoholic but he used to get hammered most Saturday nights during his playing career I live in Southampton and every landlord club owner and taxi driver has got a story about Le Tiss on the piss
Just realized I don t know a term for drinking that rhymes with Le God
Moore Charlton Shearer Beckham BTW Le Tissier played regularly until he was 34
Also not British but from Ireland Paul McGrath can be added to that list Premier League PFA player of the year as a defender I don t think any other defender has managed that
McGrath is actually about as British as it gets He s from Ealing
I ll drink to that
It s funny because he died due to his crippling alcoholism
Yep his problem was so bad that he drank through 2 livers
from what I hear hard to stick to recovery when fans were willing to buy him drinks
In his autobiography the one published before he got his liver transplant Blessed I think it was he said that he tried some hypnotherapy style treatment which he claimed worked for several weeks for him Then when the press found out he was going to it he stopped going because he didn t want people hounding him when he went
Very similar to Paul Gascoigne
Don t die like me Reading Best s story kind of ended up helping me get something of a grip on my own crippling alcoholism Learning of his tragic decline from something mercurial and almost otherwordly to something like a useless tramp bumming around in strange leagues and causing scenes It motherfucking wants you dead or down and out and it doesn t give a shit about how fast smart or successful you are The end phases of death by alcoholism sounds so utterly demeaning disgusting and painful that the actual end sounds like a massive blessing
Fuck man Glad to hear you re doing well
And the tenth anniversary and one day since 24 hour drinking laws passed in the UK
Going on up to the spirit in the sky It s where I m gonna go when I die when I die and they lay me to rest I m gonna go on the piss with Georgie Best
Conversely the man was also an alcoholic wife beating scumbag who took multiple liver transplants that could have went to more deserving people Disgusted this city named our Airport after him too We have many more deserving people in our history Edit Kicking a ball around should not absolve a person from their sins irrespective if you support that club so downvote away Edit 2 United fans down voting as expected
yeah even Utd fans tend to ignore his later days with the club I remember watching a documentary which mentioned that in his last season with Utd he got so fed up with the team s performances that he went AWOL in the middle of the season and decided he d rather party than show up to matches Can you imagine if a famous modern footballer did that
What is Carlos Tevez
Shuck it Trebek
I ll take Football Traitors for 300 Alex
Didn t City ask allow him to take the leave though
for 6 months
Disgusted this city named our Airport after him too We have many more deserving people in our history He was a product of his times and had his demons Fair play he had a dark side but who else was any better The Eamonn Holmes city airport
CS Lewis John Stewart Bell Jocelyn Brunell Gary Moore
Wait so kicking a ball has less merit than playing a guitar
I see you opted not to pick the author or respected scientists Nice
Gary Moore
A man has never defined the Blues more aptly
Agreed I m no fan of the classic blues King Allman Clapton but there was something intense about Moore s style something unique
Equally we shouldnt forget him and denigrate his achievements because he wasnt a very nice man Alcohol addiction isnt something you can control the wife beating is obviously scummy but abusing people for being addicts seems a little harsh I didnt realise an airport was named after him I assume Belfast not Turin
Yeah Belfast
What s it with greatest footballers beating their women Messi will turn alright though i think
It s just stupid people from bad backgrounds who suddenly get the world handed to them on a platter and can t deal with it well
More acceptable back then
Correlates with substance abuse and addiction problems
If Messi started on his wife she could just put him back on his high chair
Even if Messi does get started with the whole domestic violence jag he s probably too small to do much damage no
Kicking a ball around Grow up will you There are few things more cringey than someone saying football is kicking a ball around as if it s that simple You re no better than these people on Facebook demanding that footballers swap their wages with soldiers As for Best s alcoholism and liver transplants that was his personal life This post is celebrating the footballer
You re no better than these people on Facebook demanding that footballers swap their wages with soldiers I love these its brilliant to see people trying to work out the economics of it and realising how fucking stupid it is
One brings joy and entertainment to the masses The other invades foreign nations on the whim of politicians FWIW I m not having a go at soldiers We all need to make a living but we can all stretch the logic to suit our arguments
It s fucking bullshit Its like my mother or my wife when united lose a big match It s just a game For better or worse people invest a huge part of themselves to this game Look at the faces of the fans when their team scores a an important goal What else brings that much extreme mixture of positive emotions fleeting as it might be Very fucking little
It s just a game must be the stupidest quote ever To them it may just be a game but the fans it means everything people often say men show no emotion but you look in the crowd after a team has been relegated won a cup and you ll see many emotions including grown men in tears
It s the same with any Maradona post But he beat his wife but but he s a cocaine addict but he he cheated by using drugs
With a friend currently on the transplant list who has barely drank a pint in his life fuck this guy not only do people like him take organs that other people deserve more high profile cases like his actually discourages people from signing up to be a donor
high profile cases like his actually discourages people from signing up to be a donor Is that true I just can t imagine people refusing to be donors because of cases of famous people being privileged
I d be amazed if this is the case
Not what I meant in the slightest an alcoholic who is famous meaning people who might have previously signed up to be an organ donor wouldn t do so one of the main reasons people use to not sign up is because they feel that there organs would go to alcoholics and drug addicts
Some might say alcoholics and drug addicts are victims of horrible crippling illnesses too
Seen children who had no choice in the slightest become ill and rely on donations to live hard to feel sympathy for somebody who bragged about the champagne lifestyle he had and caused other people to be discouraged from signing up to be donors because they don t want there organs going to alcoholics and drug addicts For what it s worth I think there is a vast difference between someone who homeless or has suffered abuse and has turned to substance than a rich and famous footballer
So a rich and famous footballer deserves no sympathy for being blighted by a horrible condition I m not one to pick and choose who I feel bad for The man died from this He s not sitting in some mansion somewhere lording it over his stockpile of livers And I agree he s no more deserving of a liver than someone else Perhaps less so because his illness wasn t just something that could be fixed with a new liver But if you were dying and were offered a liver would you really turn it down for someone more deserving You re a bigger man than me if you would
Hang on are you saying he should have turned it down Blame the system dont blame the guy for taking something available to him that could save his life
He got himself into that situation by drinking to excess and bragging about it whenever he could
I can t believe people are circlejerking his LOL I DRANK ALL DAH ALCHAHOL quotes from him after he had one of his fifty six liver transplants It s fucking pathetic Sure he s a good footballer but he sounds like he was an absolute tosspot
Whats worse was the actual real life circle jerk People in Belfast knew he was an alcoholic it was literally killing him yet they where busting their asses to buy the man a pint just so they could say they drunk with their hero Pathetic
Pretty much exactly the same happened with Alex Higgins Probably Gazza too
You can t fault them They re Irish
Yeah if he was Australian we d probably just take a photo with him outside the local prison
That was nice
They d probably classify themselves as either Irish or more than likely Northern Irish
The man was a first class prick I m glad his hedonistic lifestyle ended as it did but the repercussions can be felt on his family
ITT folk who ve been lucky enough never to have had to deal with addiction in their lives Talk is cheap lads
I think it s where you see the average age of the subreddit coming out Haven t had to deal with their own shit or haven t lost anybody to anything like alcoholism or drug addiction Ill people aren t arseholes they re ill
Bunch of absolute cunts Seemingly think that alcoholism is just loving the drink no self control Best was just a party animal Its being dependent on alcohol every second of every day And if one more person equates him going through two livers to stopping two people having transplants I ll swing for them The first liver was his fucking own he wasnt giving that away
I ll swing for them https pbs twimg com media CHFE EvWwAA2rpH jpg
Yeah addiction is a problem and it s hard to stop doing something you re addicted to But when you burn through 2 livers because you can t stop you re taking chances away from other people People who might ve lived a longer and more decent life Talk is cheap mate Just because he was good on the pitch doesn t mean he should be worshipped off it
One of the livers was his own tbf What is your solution Let him die Its not like it was a conscious decision to kill himself after the transplant he was an addict
I don t know if I have a solution But he shouldn t have been bragging about slugging pints while on medicine
If I had to choose between dribbling past 5 players and scoring from 40 yards at Anfield or shagging Miss World it d be a hard choice Thankfully I ve done both George Best
Proper legend
Dumb cunt didn t deserve liver transplants he got Because of him many people who actually deserved 2nd chances didn t get them
Helmet
He s right though
Alcohol addiction doesn t make him a dumb cunt though
Alcoholism is the only disease you can get yelled at for having
Just an Asshole
He s a prick for other reasons but being unable to control his alcoholism isn t one of them
Its like they think that people make conscious decisions to become addicts
Yeah don t think Besty really thought oh I ve just gone through a whole load of pain and been bedridden for months while slowly bringing myself closer and closer to death but I might just do it all over again just for a laugh Could be another one of those stories people tell about my banter
Not for alcoholism For the multiple liver transplant which could be used by other non scum people
And the liver transplants were brought on by his inability to control his addiction Not sure what point you re making
The point is that people who consistently relapse into alcohol abuse shouldn t receive transplants over other patients and should be pushed down lower in the waiting lists
No shit Poirot My point is that doesn t make Best an asshole He didn t relapse on purpose
To be even considered for a liver transplant a patient has to be fully responsible to keep it healthy It is pretty much like 2nd chance When they screen for possible candidates that is an extremely important category without it people don t get livers He got them because of his status and pissed it away An addict got a healthy liver over someone who actually was sick
Hmm I m starting to think he might have had some kind of addiction to the alcohol Almost as if he had no control of his drinking We should probably tell the authorites For now let s just call it alcoholism until they come up with a better name for it
He got them because of his status and pissed it away And died People are acting like Best got away with one His addictions killed him We should be pitiying him not abusing him Its these attitudes and misunderstandings of addiction that mean we dont treat them properly
So if he got the liver because of who he was and not because he was considered responsible enough to be sensible with alcohol post transplant why does that make him an asshole Surely it d be the people who made the decision My point doesn t change if that s the argument
If you re drinking is so bad that you need many livers it s probably time to go Also being in addiction doesn t desolve you from criticism There s nothing wrong with drinking and driving then it s just addiction
Haha what an incredible leap
Well 2 people didn t get second chances not sure how he d have stopped many people lol

Horrible analogy Proper analogy would be like if someone is fat because he has horrible eating habits and gets a heart replacement over someone who actually had a genetic heart condition and needed a heart Then proceeds to ruin his healthy heart by eating shitty food while a person with a heart condition dies from the wait
Rest in Peace Best but he wasted two Liver
My uncle Harry was his minder for a few years Says one morning they woke up in Glasgow had a match at Old Trafford that day Made it back to Manchester in time for the second half Scored a hat trick
Can t believe it s been 10 years I remember watching the funeral and looking over at my Dad as silent tears rolled down his face
oh
This thread should be a quote fest
14 min compilation https www youtube com watch v 2FhhhT27KM0
Nice there was some clips I had never seen before
Yeah it s a good compilation I reckon I even like the music I remembered this clip after searching for some clips of him a while back to see how great he was and this clip thoroughly convinced me
10 years already I remember watching his funeral on the TV Shame he practically retired at 25 due to drinking and partying
If only he had a tiny bit of professionalism he could have gone on to be a Man Utd legend like Wayne Rooney
The famously professional Wayne Rooney Would you say the same about Tony Adams
If Tony Adams had missed training to go and get pissed or if he retired because he didn t get his own way and threw a hissy fit about leaving the club then yes Just so happens he didn t do any of that but that arrogant cunt Best did
Must have missed a fair bit of training when he was in jail for two months having been convicted of drunk driving Alcoholism is a disease why does Adams get a pass where Best does not
Because Adams as a former Arsenal player is infallible apparently
Adams as a former Arsenal player didn t ruin two livers through being a pisshead cunt and didn t run away from training numerous times to aid that It s a case of someone who turned their life around and one nasty bastard who refused to
He did however drive drunk and admitted to playing games for Arsenal while pissed So he was a danger to others and put his career at risk Its a case of someone who turned their life around and someone who couldnt Do you think all addicts are just selfish
George Best drunk himself through multiple livers and into his deathbed Tony Adams beat his addiction and set up the sporting chance clinic to help fellow athletes beat their addictions
Continuing to drink after his liver transplant was stupid but it cost him his life Do you think he was doing it for a laugh because he just loved a party Alcoholism is a disease Adams should be lauded for beating it but Best shouldnt be abused for succumbing To criticise Best for allowing his alcoholism to affect his career and not Adams who missed months of a season and even played drunk is hypocritical
Stay classy buddy
Stay classy buddy How is he not being classy What the fuck does classy even mean in this sense You spoke ill of a footballer I like ergo you are not classy Typical vote pandering neckbeard babble
Maybe criticising someone in a thread about the anniversary of their death isn t a terribly nice thing to do
It s 100 serious I don t understand why Man Utd fans fall over themselves to laud Best who never wanted to play for them and missed training all the time to go get pissed yet slander a club legend like Rooney if he goes a couple of games without scoring
who never wanted to play for them You re speaking out of your arse Also no one s slandering Rooney He s their second highest goal scorer From what I can tell they merely want him benched
He has a point though Play to your best your entire career win countless accolades retire late on like Rooney and Lampard and you will be hated mercilessly mocked and ridiculed Burn out retire early and drink yourself half to death and the nation will love you for it We have a weird self loathing complex in English football where we hate the successful but eulogise the people who wasted their careers and talent
Yeah Lineker Shilton Shearer Beckham Scholes Neville etc are all hated Lets not pretend Rooney doesnt get a lot of warranted stick He s unprofessional he spends his summers drinking and smoking and he s twice threatened to walk out on United in order to get himself a bigger pay packet He s also not performed for England at a tournament in 10 years including letting us down badly in 2006 He s clearly been a fantastic player but that doesnt mean we have to love him

CamaradonaEverything is back to normal in r soccer now
Setanta commentator they ve been well almost perfect while Messi s been away And now they re em they re just perfect
Still no Pogba screamers
Not enough degaard updates either
And Diego Costa antics shaming
He just got someone sent off I don t think it will be long
Well there it is
Chelsea are winning games now though
It s truly miraculous how game in this situation is plural
Tis a Christmas miracle
Was Messi actually injured Jesus
Took time off to gather more Ki
Yeah he ran out of sensu beans earlier
He gave them to Suarez and Neymar actually He didn t need them
He s been doing intense meditation sessions with the Elder Kai and is now Mystic Messi
Spent a couple of episodes charging up his spirit bomb
Just took time off to become Super Messi God Super Messi
more Ki Seung yueng
He s going to for a Spirit bomb isn t he
Those three are just insane Mezmerizing
Messimerizing
Yeah something like that D
Messimaruazing
Messuaneymarising
That s actually one of the best team goals I ve ever seen
How do you even defend that Three players just absolutely tearing through the whole team
foul
lucas would have brought somebody down
Except he would have already been on a yellow and would have had to let him go
Classic
two fouls
People can t just go flying through the air like that Jackie
You don t That s when you shake your head and say Too good
You just can t They re doing this against Roma but they could do it to any side
They can only do it when the opposing team doesn t defend properly If they do track the runners you can stop moves like that Problem is they do it to you all game and eventually you have a lapse in concentration and they do this to you
Just takes one player s lapse in concentration for that breakdown The fact that Barca does this so frequently is what s scary
was thinking that I suppose the backline has to push up with impeccable timing but with passing that quick it s not gonna happen In fairness to Roma they look like they were trying not to sit too deep but that frontline is just too good
Foul hard enough to sit someone down on the build up
At the start of the clip Keita is man marking him After Messi lays the ball of he follows it when he didn t need to If he stays with him he can block his run Even after Keita lost him it was still stoppable When Messi lays the ball of the second time Maicon doesn t react to his run If he reacted earlier he would have easily dealt with the ball It s great play by Barca and they caused the mistakes but the goal was avoidable from Roma s perspective
If Keita had stayed with Messi then Neymar would ve passed to Suarez instead From there Suarez would have the ball with plenty of space Neymar and Messi to look up to and maybe even made a similar sort of run himself there s just endless possibilities so score when you ve got a team playing as good as Barca have been playing
track the runners instead of chasing the ball The RCB has didn t track the run of messi leading to the goal
The RB and CB tried he was just too quick for them
Football porn
It s reminiscent of Arsenal s goal vs Norwich Aka this one https www youtube com watch v wz EaTwqNII
Why the fuck did someone feel the need to play Coldplay over this
Apparently either Norwich or Arsenal used to rule the world
Just not as good as Arsenal s I might be biased
Biased but correct tbqh
staight from the most biased source of them all thanks
Nah that Norwich goal was beautiful
No definitely not as good but similar for sure
God I love soccer
That was better than porn imo
You can t just pay a young lady with big tits to deliver goals like this in the champions league
That s what you think
Maybe we should try
We do have the technology now
Like something straight out of a video game
I wish I could do that in Fifa
And that finish Pure art
Seriously how the fuck do you stop that Unreal
chop him down
MSN is finally back
You know what s unfair this is not even surprising anymore Those three are an exhibition
Seriously Watched this goal and was like oh wow that was nice but was upset that the ball was played over the top to Messi instead of a backheel I just want the buildup to go on forever because I know once he s through its over
Good guy Alves
Didn t pull a Nani
That still irritates me
Some say it still keeps Ronaldo up at night
That explains why he keeps moving further and further away from Ronaldo
That will always irritate me Nani ruined what would have been the greatest goal of Ronaldo s life Ronaldo beats both the greatest defender in the world at the time Pique then the greatest keeper of all time Casillas against who was the greatest team in the world at the time Spain All those things together and Nani invalidates the goal with his greed Infuriating To this day I think it was the greatest piece of football I ve ever seen of course enhanced by the fact that he beat both Pique and Casilllas I don t care how impressive a clip is if it s in the Ukranian league EDIT To everybody telling me Nani was onside I don t know if it was true I still see a lot of debate till today Ronaldo still argues that Nani was onside Here is the best screenshot I could get from a low fps clip you be the decider https gyazo com 6c13739c5292aab0594f73b8c685092f Ronaldo always seemed to be a good sport about it but onside or offside that ball was going over the line and I don t see why Nani couldn t shy away like Alves did to give his teammate his deserved goal
But it was a friendly Ronaldo should have done that in the weeks before when he was playing spain in the world cup
Does anybody have a clip of this
https youtu be j5gDJfFvObg
idk soccer what happened
The ball would have gone in the net and been a goal for Ronaldo but because Nani headed the ball in while being offsides there was no goal Edit got called offsides
We followed the guy Ronaldo completly outplay the defense of the opposing team and scoring a goal or so he thought At the last moment one of his teammates hits the ball but he s so far up he s off side thus cancelling the goal Ronaldo gets mad rightfully so i d say
Here you go
Nani was onside though no 3 I think Pique plays him on with his legs because he s lying down and even so Nani touched it after it passed the line
STUPID NANI CANCEL CRISTIANO RONALDO AMAZING GOAL NEW 2015
GONE SEXUAL
he was behind messi when he shot he ball he actually impeded the defenders clearance by being in front of him Woulda been called offside had he actually been offside
He is in ultra teamplayer mode today
Isn t he always
He is he rather passes the ball than score himself
Great restraint and he held off that last defender
Hahah it s just really bad defending right guys They can t really be that good Right Guys sobs
I instantly turned into arab football commentator what a beauty
Why arab Are they the same as those south americans that yell goooal for like a minute
Replace GOL with YA ALLLLAAAAAAAAH
Yababa ya baba
They don t stop talking for a second literally
No joke These guys talk incessantly for 90 minutes Every single action on the pitch is commentated
https youtu be XTpGw 7Y0as They sound hilarious
love the rhyming Arabic and French are becoming my favorite commentary languages
Actually the guy goes full poetry It s an Arabic thing
They re my favourite because they don t copyright their stuff so we can use it
They say golaso in Arabic
Golaso is universal
MESSIHU AKBAR
I swear the podium for the Ballon D or should be Neymar Messi and Suarez
Not in that order though right
It s a podium 1 in the middle
Of course it should
the tikiest of taka
See if Barcelona scored a goal like this it would be at the top of r soccer
I ain t even mad
My god this is one of the more fine goals I ve ever seen
If i dont see peak bayern and peak barcelona play each other this year i will be slightly angry
The passing the movement the Messi Perfection on a football pitch
Some fine Messi ing by Barcelona so far tonight
This is some performance Suicidally naive high press by Roma but Barcelona s passing and pressure is just beautiful Nigh unplayable
We ve made Messi a verb Pack it up boys
passing and movement are nouns as is Messi
As is life
Dear Lord that is filthier than shitting in your hands and clapping

Barcelona are pretty decent at attacking
This was clearly Modric s fault
This Messi guy apparently is good

Too short though He ll never get over with the fans
Is that you Vince McMahon
What do you even do What the fuck can you even do against that
Messi Suarez Neymar being on one team should serve precedent for an antitrust violation in football
Greatest front three of all time
And they say tiki taka is boring
Alves what a bro
Love how Alves doesn t touch it
Never thought i would see this many Roma posts on the r Soccer front page
Neymar Messi Neymar Messi Su rez lob Messi lob GOOOOOOOAL
THE MESSIAH IS BACK
That was the Mona Lisa of goals I could sit and watch it all day
5 0 now this is one of the best players to ever play together
What the fuck is this shit How the fuck do you beat this shit What the fuck
Alves being a bro
DAMN 5 0 now this is absolutely the best Barcelona squad
MSN is back
aside from the possible risk of epilepsy good gif
You re looking for the word seizure Epilepsy is a disorder that usually includes symptoms like seizures
Thanks that is the word
Oh my
I regret nothing
He s Back
Let s face it at this moment Barca is just at a totally different level The set up of that goal is crazy and the finish Well its a Messi finish what else can be said
The assist for the goal was totally flithy I think that was from Suarez Such a deft touch
What a goal These guys are playing at an insane level nowadays
Holy shit
tiki taka level MSN
reminds me of Austrias team goal vs Liechtenstein this year http gfycat com GoodnaturedDistinctItalianbrownbear
yep MSN are still scary af
Wonder what Ray Hudson would have to say about this one

He s too busy foaming at the mouth
Two things that turn worse on videogames Curry and MSN

Nothing Messi about that that was clean
If any Prem team scored a goal like that it would be goal of the season That seems to be a standard Barca goal All their goals are just amazing
Ray Hudson s balls have just imploded and exploded simultaneously

Barcelona look fucking MAGIC this year I smell another treble

There so in sync it s like they re kit numbers are 9 10 and 11

BAAA
Incredible goal my god
That was insanely good
Oh my what the fuck MSN That was honestly magical
Falque thought about appealing for offside for a second before deciding fuck it
Shit is not even fair jesus
Suarez can do anything
You know at this point you should really just foul them Maicon grab his shirt and pull him the fuck down So you ll get a yellow big deal But I guess it doesn t matter in the end because they gonna score some more anyway
He s baaaack
I love how people used to worry about how selfish Suarez and Neymar would play with Messi on the same pitch Jumped off my couch for this one

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsIs a player considered a one club man if he was loaned out early in his career
If Andros Townsend spends the rest of his career at tottenham it would be funny if he gets considered as a one club man after like 10 loans
No need to exaggerate only 9 loans
Yes Lahm was loaned to Stuttgart back in his early days if I recall correctly and he s still considered a one club man i m sure there are other examples it s just that I can t think of anyone else from the top of my head
John Terry also was loaned out but noone would really argue he isn t a one club man eitherGood man Had a season ticket at Cracovia when I studied out there Some season we re having Great to see Kapustka doing so well too
Lived in Hyde Park Burley Roundhay and Swarcliffe Never had a problem in any of them
Can the dog die May sound weird but me purchasing the game is highly dependant on this I don t want to let him down
Leeds have more points than that
There s a club on Elland Road just off Lowfields Road who could do with some new players at the moment Owner is a bit of a knob mind Could probably get a game
Just a normal Leeds fan he was active on a Leeds message board once upon a time Tackle was clean and just done for a laugh that s how Vinnie was
Bremner or even his Leeds team mate Norman Bites yer legs Hunter Aggressive players who sure could play
So wrong

Can someone tell me exactly what these things are I need to accept I can t grow a beard I m also guessing you wouldn t recommend buying a cheap razor from eBay
Don t give a fuck about off the line clearances ten men etc It s an away win And with how we ve been playing I ll take it
Silvestri terrible for the goal which is a shame as his handling looked markedly better today Berardi positive on the ball but some mistakes such as passing Bamba erratic Cooper meh Taylor handled his winger well and got in behind once Dallas meh Adeyemi woeful Murphy positive on the ball dwelled a bit at times though Cook far too good for this team Wood did he win a header Antenucci hard worker always looks like he ll make something happen We need something different hopefully Botaka is it
I m just not sure why it takes us so bloody long to get going Dallas is great but only in the second half I d start Antenucci on the right over Byram He might say he doesn t want to but I don t think a player should dictate his terms to the manager He s a right footed player who is clearly comfortable cutting inside and shifting it onto his left He can definitely do a job there I d also like to see Murphy start over Mowatt
No worries I can see Inter having a good season Strengthened well and Juve s poor start will be a great motivator

Apparently they found a bomb in a truck which was disguised as a ambulance oustide the stadium
They planned to play the french anthem instead of the german one in the stadium
Don t use Hola It s up to some shady shit
Holy shit that may be the highest rated squad I ve ever seen You have a 91 rated Thiago on the bench ffs Nice job The presentation looks very nice too
Yes this is the area final Should have clarified that This is Fratton Park home stadium of Portsmouth
I won after penalties Every penalty went in until I finally saved their 8th shot And sorry for this stupid small screen GIF My first time recording my screen on PC and I didn t put FIFA in fullscreen because I didn t think it would like this if I didn t Ninja EDIT I m Portsmouth btw and was playing against Crawley Town against Legendary
No you could hear three explosions in the first half very loud in the stadium and broadcastExcept we can t beat Spurs Like ever
Neither can Swansea
yeah well
Zac would be a Swansea fan
because he s pretty but struggling of late
Same back at you With love not really Man Utd
I got your back bro
This year only one team has beaten Spurs Even United needed an OG to do it
Yep Here s a list of scorers of winning goals against Spurs in the prem this season Kyle Walker
Always rated him
Wenger did in fact almost sign him
United didn t beat Spurs Kyle Walker did
If Walker had not scored Rooney would have
Rooney looked like he had a bad case of buck fever in that instance Much like Kane did last Sunday
It s less fun when you think of it that way
To be fair the only reason Walker ended up scoring is because Rooney bottled it
Man of the match he was I was hoping he would hit top form that game too haha
And everyone can beat Villa
Almost everyone
sadly
I mean we ve beaten everyone else since our return Both us and Tottenham have had a mix of managers And yet no matter what we seem to do we just can t beat them I m not hopeful the December match this year either
We ll probably go 2 0 up but end as a draw
Maybe though you re apparently more confident in our team s ability to go 2 up against any team right now
I always get super nervous against Southampton since you guys are usually tearing it up at the time but for whatever reason we seem to pull the win or tie out of no where at times Usually great games though well at least in my biased opinion haha
I think two or three times in the last couple of season we ve been 2 0 up against you guys at half time then Christian Eriksen just decides to tear us apart in the second half and you guys win 3 2
Or that one season of Adebeyor going nuts in his first game back under Sherwood Basically his only bit of form in years and it gets him two goals against us
It was nice feeling the way Spurs might have felt when Elia went nuts and scored two away against Newcastle last season
Yeah fuck Newcastle and that Krul game
Yeah just go God mode for one game and all is well We d been on a good run against Newcastle at that point too
I think we seem to beat you and Swansea a lot as your good footballing sides like we are but also not quite as good as us So you don t sit deep you actually have a go at us That weird thing where you tend to struggle more against as worse side who are just happy to take a draw It s like how united used to just always beat us
This season it is definitely you doing the tearing up
tie Spotted the American
spoiler alert there s more than one
Wait non English people watch footy as well
Haha true I hadn t even noticed I actually usually do say draw interestingly enough

And we can t beat fucking Norwich such is life
Newcastle Norwich was 6 2 sorry to be that guy
FUCK
Sorry Love your work though
I preferred his earlier stuff it s too commercial now
Did you actually make this Saw it earlier on today on another site
These things get made around this time every year Someone else could ve made one as well
Well at least I didn t have to be that guy
That game broke my heart
That game partially mended mine only for it to be repeatedly shattered afterwards
Business as usual as a Newcastle supporter then
Should say where anybody can beat Chelsea
except Arsenal
And us
In fairness we can t beat anyone
Bournemouth
Oh do fuck off
Fuck injuries
After 13 games I m starting to think the only word to describe us is that we re Fucked
Chin up Tamworth is only 9 points from the top
You think you re special We lose every week
Looking forward to this weekend but will be sitting in the home end as the away end sold out
Actually says Where nobody can beat Leicester Except Arsenal
Not saying we would ve won but to be fair Mike Dean fucked us over e Lol no idea why I m in the negative now Hell I don t get r soccer sometimes the officiating that match was dreadful and even Chelsea fans can admit that
You guys always say that
Every team s fanbase blames the refs on a regular basis hardly an Arsenal exclusive phenomenon Did you even watch that match It was a very unusual case
I was joking I forgot how sensitive it gets in here sometimes I remember Mike Dean fucking over many teams to be fair I didn t catch that specific match but did see the outrage afterwards My cousin supports arsenal and after every loss he blames the ref no matter what It s quite funny
Your cousin must have hated you for joining Manchester United
Nah its all good he got him an Xbox
Yeah well
Never expected to see Dan s thumbs on r soccer
Is this from Ninja Sex Party
This ninja
No this one NSFW
Isn t Juventus having a pretty poor start to their campaign as well
They started out absolutely abysmally Chelsea esque but have recently been kicking things up and are in the 6 spot after beating Milan last Saturday
Leicester have still only lost once and they went into the lead in that game mad
The best team they didn t lose to was Tottenham and they drew them The best team they ve beaten is West Ham 2 1 The next month will be telling for this team
Pretty good considering our defence let in 14 goals in the first 7 games Thank god for the rest of the team making us score
Like Liverpool 2013 14
But Leicester Could win the league
In fairness them being in the league doesn t add much as they where behind in a load of games Spurs have also only lost once
What about when not being fair
For La Liga 12 games played Sporting beat Malaga beat Deportivo beat Rayo beat Palmas beat Sociedad beat Sevilla beat Getafe beat Levante beat Villarreal beat Atletico beat Eibar beat Granada beat Bilbao beat Valencia beat Celta beat Barca beat Real beat Espanyol beat Betis beat Sporting There is nothing special about this specific cycle there are 3657 such cycles for La Liga Havent written code for EPL You can find the code here http pastebin com QdRvfwRv You will need to modify the arrays if you want it to work for the different leagues EDIT Coded it for EPL There are 144 such chains for EPL A different example for EPL Bournemouth beat West Ham beat Newcastle beat Norwich beat Swansea beat United beat Tottenham beat Sunderland beat Crystal Palace beat Liverpool beat City beat Everton beat West Brom beat Arsenal beat Leicester beat Watford beat Stoke beat Southampton beat Chelsea beat Aston Villa beat Bournemouth
without a circly picture I won t believe you
The circlier the truthier
Which is to say if anyone can beat anyone La Liga is more competitive
Yeah this means nothing Example circles for La Liga Serie A
Without pictured badges and fancy slogan I won t believe you
Damnit man I m a software engineer not a graphic designer
Not with that attitude
And now do Bundesli oh well Bayern
The Internet being the Internet
Graphviz
graphviz is where it s at
Damn right it is I don t usually get to see my computer science and football worlds intersect so neatly
La Liga Where anybody can beat anybody
The irony that this is more true for La Liga when this infographic was meant to defend the EPL s recent poor form in Europe is pretty funny
And in all 144 Leicester will be next to Arsenal and Spurs will be next to ManU
For what it s worth here s the version with the corrected scores http imgur com JzpajZe Edit Correcterer scores
Did you use an algorithm to find this path or was your work manual Edit I was bored so I spent a little bit of time writing a Java app to brute force it Here s all the combinations of which 144 exist at the moment They all start on Stoke but being circular you d get the same results ultimately no matter where you started Edit 2 OP s combination is on line 43 Edit 3 Tried to do the same for Bundesliga And well Can t because Bayern
Shouldn t be too hard to do manually it s quite closely defined by the fact that Villa and Bournemouth have only won one game each and Tottenham and Leicester have only lost one After that there aren t too many decisions to make
not to mention a better render of our logo good good good

the answer we were looking for was badge or crest
We all know what he meant but it s badge
Is it still a badge if there is no shield
Get ready for the Sport bible to steal this without credit
I remember this was the case during the 13 14 season as well and it turned into a very good season entertainment wise so hopefully it s the same here
It feels like this one has already started to top 13 14
It s shaping up quite similar 4 5 teams at the top of the table with only a couple of points separating them the champions faltering badly and a team at the bottom who everyone has nailed down as relegated but a new manager could bring some hope
Hope What s this magical hope you re talking of
He was talking about Chelsea
I don t know I m being nice to Villa it must be this damn Christmas spirit of mine
I hope some of our opposition have some Christmas spirit and gift us three points soon I m looking at you Watford
I hope Scrooge takes away your points for Christmas
You need a heart transplant for being nice to the Seals and a brain transplant for thinking they have a hope
Yeah but I don t think Chelsea will fire Mourinho
Obviously I m a biased Liverpool fan but 13 14 was ridiculous Suarez had one of the best years that I ve ever seen from any footballer Yaya Toure was at his peak devastating bullying best Mourinho blew his chances of winning the league in his first year back at Chelsea with conservative tactics Tactics Tim had that beautiful gilet and weird salute thing with Adebayor Fulham hired a crazy guy and Moyes ruined Man U Crazy season This season is good so far though even if Liverpool have been mostly bad
We got Klopp that s the best part of this season
13 14 a good season depends on the perspective I guess
We only lost 2 0 to City not 3
Oh man seems I have a real problem reading and copying Apologies
It feels good that we only fit in this because of a very unfortunate own goal
we only lost 3 1 to Southampton
Ugh I had the results written out right in front of me as I made it and I still ballsed it up Apologies
Literally a cicrlejerk
This graphic for new r soccer logo
BPL is the most entertaining league Great density at the top great international players and teams with lots of tradition still being at the top Downsides are the atmosphere in the stadium and the lack of homegrown talent EDIT for some reason I like Stoke
In reference to your latter point lack of homegrown talent that s one of the reasons it s been so exciting to follow Spurs lately It s a shame that it does seem so rare but hopefully with investment in academies we ll see such things become more common
convert him Convert Him CONVERT HIM RUMMENIGGER THE SPURS SUPPORTER
Sod off We don t have many foreign supporters we need all the ones we ve got
Give the paperwork on that Messi transfer some time and you ll be good
Well not too much time otherwise our fax machine might start having problems
Go Stoke
Everyone s a Stoke fan when they want to downplay Messi or Barcelona
I ll fight you for him
I was really sad that I didn t name myself Rummenigga
it s ok we got u
Uhhh autocomplete
All of ours are injured
EDIT for some reason I like Stoke Top lad Most of the atmospheres are decent really its the top teams with their day trippers who struggle
EDIT for some reason I like Stoke All the right reasons
For some reason continentals think when we say it s the best league it means the highest quality teams when it s only because it s the most exciting even if the quality isn t as high
It might still be if you account for the entire table
Atmospheres at the big clubs maybe
Just wait till next year and your move into a bowl stadium
That s when we become a big club you heard it here first domalino
Atmosphere at West Ham has been slowly dying for years Doubt there will ever be a game like the Ipswich play offs again which is kind of sad
I was at the home leg of the Ipswich game and I have a season ticket this year and I disagree Think that s an odd game to pick because there have been better games since beating Chelsea a few weeks ago was about as good as any game I ve been to Even Everton in the cup last year with less than 30 000 fans there Every Tottenham game
Ya the top teams have superstars are fun to watch and are prone to playing like shit every third or 4th week so the other sides aren t completely out of it
Stoke
wouldn t you be able to do this in any league with no undefeated teams
Not necessarily no If you have teams that have only beaten the same teams for example it gets tricky Also only 13 games in to a season is quite early however in that crazy 13 14 season it only took 10 games
Oh ok thanks for clarifying that up
No worries Also it was made trickier by the fact Leicester have only lost one Tottenham have only lost one and Aston Villa have only won one so their positions were fixed in the circle next to Arsenal Man U and Bournemouth respectively
Not necessarily because it s possible a league has two teams who have only lost once each but both to the same team You wouldn t be able to do a circle if that were the case
Where everybody is kinda not really good and everyone will watch the UCL semis from their comfy couch
The whole anybody can beat anybody thing is true of every league in the world and I still don t understand why people only ever say it about the Premier League like they re unique or something Even in supposed one two horse race leagues like La Liga the juggernaut teams almost always lose a couple of games a season to teams they shouldn t be losing to
Because big teams lose to small teams very often that hardly happens in la liga and especially the bundesliga Although it does happen from time to time it s just a lot more uncommon Plus imagine barca bayern or madrid in the position chelsea is in right now Quite literally impossible But not saying the competitiveness of the league is the sole reason for the bad form but it does contribute
Plus imagine barca bayern or madrid in the position chelsea is in right now Quite literally impossible on the other hand could you imagine Chelsea or city or united sinking into mediocrity like AC Milan did in serie A
You mean like we did 5 6 years ago Doesn t happen often I grant you but it still happens
Something like Chelsea is literally happening for the first time in the Prem it s a bit silly to infer anything from it It s exceptional Well except for Dortmund last season I guess
How fast are people forgetting United under Moyes
Moyes United wasn t nearly as bad as Chelsea were in their first 12 or so games this season
No but other aspects of their respective declines are similar
That s because the big teams in Bayern Madrid and Barca are better and more consistent than the teams fighting for the title in the EPL
True u Al Gala needs to give us an infographic of upset frequency to really measure the stratification of the top leagues
Marketing
I feel like The Circle of Life should be playing in the background There s even a lion with a crown on its head
I got you https youtu be VxTQKxyJyxw
Fuckin hell norwich scored 2 goals against newcastle amazing up front Just the back was the problem
I remember that one time Villa won a match What a day
Any particular reason why you made the scores on the bottom half as if they were away wins I am not moaning about it just found it very confusing
I tried to make it so the team s score was closest to their logo I m graphically challenged though and didn t know how best to put it on the thing
Here is the one from 13 14 season http i imgur com oGtMJF2 jpg I personally find that way easier I could not imagine any kind of layout with scorelines in there either tough task
Yeah I did that one too tried to step it up with scores this time haha
Ah I was wondering since you mentioned that in your other comment here Really challenging design with the scorelines I will see if I can come up with something as well
I actually hadn t seen it as Elinaeri did although of course that is the standard football naming convention Scores closest to the logo made sense to me
Maybe as a cyclical human centipede
Can someone make one of these for the 03 04 season
Look at how much we suck look at our top teams failing week in week out That must mean the league is more competitive s
Football Feed on facebook have nicked your post
Well technically it s after 106 games played
I m glad we could do our part with our one win against Bournemouth
I ll believe that when we beat Palace
A Condorcet circle The cool thing about Condorcet circles is that you can delete all of the results from all of the matches involved in the circle and get the same rankings The thing is though that this is probably not the only Condorcet circle in the EPL this season
I am not sure but I don t think this holds true if the teams are separated by goal difference
Right only zero sum results Disregard the scores
https twitter com SoccerAM status 669613679013400576 Looks like SoccerAM have reposted this without giving credit
Where anybody can beat anybody Except Villa Villa can only beat Bournemouth
this is really cool
Awfully kind of Villa to only win one game this year to give our content creators somewhere to start
Giggled at Liverpool beating Stoke 1 0 thinking about last year and all
Do this for the 2003 04 season
urgh probably the only team to lose to sunderland Most depressing night this season
I will see if I can come up with scores this time haha AhC
Ah ok that went over my head P
I think he does often play as a right back he s right footed
Let s talk about facts

Marcelo Azevedo
where did Koscielny play before I thought he had been a centre back since the beginning of his career at Guingamp Tours Lorient
idk lol it all happened so fast
wow does anyone have a gif of Ward s skill to get around kaboul just now i think it was an elastico or nutmeg too quick to tell
after triumphantly turning into Diamond Palace last match v Liverpool I fully expect Palace to play like Tin Palace and go 0 2 down against Sunderland today within 20 minutes
Maybe Sarfaraz Ahmed 48 off 46 and Misbah 68 off 72 to win that match against SL in dying light in Jan 2014 Also definitely Sehwag 83 off 68 v England he turned a draw into a win Finally Sarwan and Chanderpaul chatting 418 v Aus in 2003
Apparently pontus wernbloom and Cheick Tiot
Is there not a rule in place that prevents loanees from playing against their parent club
Ah ok
That pass to Arnautovic was class don t know who did it tho

nice thanks for the threadDamn number 66 is not looking good today
That s Marcio Azevedo i really don t know why he s at Shakhtar or how he s been doing but he was average to shit in Brazil
But he always had 5 Star skills on FIFA
he has 4 get your shit together
He had 5 in FIFA 12
i am aware always had not sound weird to anyone else tho plus he wasn t even on fut 14 and 15
Fifa 12 13 legend
Probably has a very good agent
Most big teams get the world class brazillian talent Shakhtar ends up mostly with average ones Jadson Douglas Costa and William are probably exceptions
Not really most of their offensive buys were once a great prospect here Bernard did extremely well in Brazil and won Libertadores with Atletico Fred was bought early in his Internacional career but he was already highly rated Taison was great at Internacional where he also won the Libertadores Wellington Nem who hasn t been playing also did quite well at Fluminense and was considered a young prospect in Brazil Alex Teixeira was as highy rated as Coutinho in the beginning of their career at Vasco Then you have Fernandinho Douglas Costa Jadson Willian The average players they get are defenders like Marcio Azevedo and Ismaily
I am actually brazillian too but now living in Spain I know the trajetory of most of the players you mentioned and we have to be honest there is a reason a lot of talented players dont suceed or arent as great as they look the brazillian league isnt on a high level for something about 10 12 years most of the talent ends up being not even close to world class when they come to Europe
me and every other brazilian fan might agree that the league isn t nowhere near as it once was but still those players were good young prospects once if they turn out to be world class or not that s another thing
Marcelo Azevedo
Marcio Dante Azevedo

That was the most hardman nutmeg and lob combination i ve ever seen Awesome
Dani is a warrior It s criminal that Danilo has started over him
He looks like he spends his spare time lumberjacking
What a goal from a right back with his weak foot
dani and luka scoring in the same match i m not crying you re crying
Ronaldo with a goal and two assists
Assist of the year right there
it s almost as good as busquet s assist
Master playmaker Anderson
Hans J rg Butt is the real deal
I m a fan of Tom Carroll s assist to Bale
that is beautiful Robben was certainly lucky to have a guy like Butt helping him to get on the scoresheet
I miss him
He s OUR Anderson now
Prefer this one from Xavi
HAHAHAHA Klopp
Busquet will remind that for the rest of his life He will tell his grandsons about that one for sure
Exquisite passing
here go
Savage
this is a real madrid post get that barcelona trash out of here
you see those men in white
Well real madrid are in the gif
This one too mate http youtu be yWVrolNQ4RU
Talk about being bitter lol
Still bummed out about last weekend
I don t think he s a Madrid fan
Why is this the top comment
Still managed to miss few chances
Decoy90 Okay so where s the real banter
No banter whatsoever I m glad he s back in form but he can be even better
He s just scored again lol But I don t believe he s back in form
Exactly how I feel It s going great for him but it doesn t feel like he s in top form I mean it s two assists and two goals can t be much better on paper but there is room for improvement
Can he even get back to form his knee problem isn t gonna go away with playing more lol
That is an excellent goal
Azevedo still living off his Fifa 13 self because it s clearly not working out for him irl
hahaha 5 skills
Where are the people saying Carvajal isnt offensive
Sweet nutmeg but surely that shove would be a foul right
Best goal of the night for me
Carvajal Danilo
Carvajal is just as good attacking as he is at defending Danilo is just as bad attacking as he is defending
what a goal
Has to be a starter this guy
What a rough game number 66 is having Also great goal from carvajal
What s with the recent explosionin the number of fullback goals
Fullback envy sweeping Europe
I love how he just nutmegs him and as the defender is trying to recover he just shoves him to the side
Isn t that a foul on 66
That was unexpected
hnnng fucking awesome
Yasss
nice curl
I can t tell if that was a cross or a shot Still a sexy goal regardless
Am I the only one for whom none of the streamable links are working right now
Why was the camera so zoomed in Thought it was a replay at first
The Shakhtar defenders find new ways to be crap for each goal
Does anyone have a normal angle Absolutely hate that let s zoom in on one player crap
Carvajal going James on this one
Jesus chris what a belter
What exactly is a belter supposed to mean I always assumed it meant fast hard and direct
yea that wasn t a belter by any means
Goalazo
What a cross
Ronaldo must be pissed at that
deleted
huh
I m surprised to see Ronaldo do those fakes I ve heard that he hasn t done many dribbling tricks recently Or is that just talking about 5 star skill type stuff
He hasn t done any skill to put a defender behind in like i don t even know Those fakes he does them every day
OK I don t really watch Madrid games I d rather not stay up until 5am for a game that isn t Arsenal the Socceroos or a World Cup finalSorry man I know you want to praise your defender but if Sterling put that on target either to Buffon s left or right that would have gone in It was a terrible miss from Sterling no defending could have saved you there

Felix Brych is such a terrible referee woeful calls all across the game Edit Every fucking year as well God fucking damnit
What A Goal
Anybody have any idea what s going on with Hart
Feeling a red card coming The players are getting fed up with it all
Unable to go back since I m relying on other people s streams Normally I would be able to go back into the match to grab that for you but now tonight Sorry mate
Cross was by Alex Sandro

Maybe try selecting a role for him in that position that s what I do So instead of CM Playing position select CM Central Midfielder That s what I do when I want to re train my player and it seems to help
He s still at United in 2018 in my save Getting decent amount of apps but not a key player United did buy Kane in their first season so they play him instead
Getting no yellows is pretty difficult thing to do Your players will make tactical fouls and or lose their head and make rash challenges It s pretty much impossible to not get carded at least once in a game
Can I see your squad I m currently playing with Gent and I m only in 2018 so I m still struggling a bit
Get Zabaleta
HOLY SHIT BOYS THEY DID IT Belgium is proud of you
Pretty fucking stupid that two four steps are guarded
That first minute red card though
Probably Pardew
Fuck I didn t get Bolasie s skill that lost him the ball in itSorry i just went off of what the article said not very knowledgable about Sweden Thanks for correcting that
Thats actually an awesome picture thanks for posting it
After they see how he handles Messi and Neymar at the Euros they will definitely sign him
3978 miles to go see Belgium in a friendly against the US in Cleveland Ohio Well worth it
Jelle Vossen from Burnley to Club Brugge is comfirmed Signed a 5 year contract
LvG s Notes
Ghost corner in Belgian first division game
How about Vidic s double tackle
Belgium put up their tent in Cyprus box hopefully some goals follow real soon here Starting to look like shooting practice out there
De Bruyne Gotze Kagawa
Robot Celebration
Same goes for The Netherlands sometimes they are referred to as just Holland while this is technically not the whole of The Netherlands It would be the same as referring to Great Britain s team as England
I like it but using Fellaini next De Bruyne feels funny to me In the future we d have Thorgan Musonda Jr or Praet for that spot Not that I rate them that highly but just seems like a position better fit for them
I agree with your future midfield line up In 4 6 years Tielemans Malanda Musinda would ve been a massive midfield Kind of like Witsel Fellaini Defour back in Standards days
I feel you My choice for Origi is based on the fact that i feel he will have a growth period in the next two years that will make him more compatible with the players around him like Hazard and De Bruyne He is more unpredictable than Lukaku in the field but I got to give Lukaku credit though As for Benteke he seems to be having trouble finding his form maybe a transfer to a bigger team make change that for him
Belgium for Euros 2016 not much difference from WC2014 GK Courtois RB Meunier CB Kompany CB Alderweireld LB Vertonghen CDM Witsel CDM Niangolan RM Mirallas CAM De Bruyne LM Hazard ST Origi
Probably pretty unknown but Tom De Mul Belgian winger who spent his youth at Ajax similar route as Vertonghen Vermaelen and Alderweireld Managed to get a transfer to Sevilla which wasn t a bad club at the time but couldn t stay fit so retired when he was 28 last year Also Arsenal s Diaby and Spurs s King
They forgot Toby Alderweireld on loan at Southampton from Atletico Madrid and ex Ajax And of course other but thought he deserved a mention since Southampton is second in the BPL atm
I don t know if he counts yet since he hasn t proven himself in a top competition yet but Martin Odegaard is 15 years old and made his debut for Norway s national team already http youtu be Smi8jvNixL8
Thank you This is awesome I didn t know any of this Missed those good years sadly
Thank you so much that s so interesting Didn t know any of this How old was Totti when Real Madrid bid for him
Can someone tell me more about the hype around Totti and Pirlo when they were younger I was way too young to remember how they started out and i feel they ve been left out of this discussion
I feel that PSG would try to bring back Eric Gerits back to France He s familiar with the French way of playing and was a solid coach at Marseille Would be a surprise though Maybe even give Zidane a chance although these two are both Marseille men at heart you never know what money will do
Carlos Puyol will possibly make a good future coach He used to always be driven to steer his fellow team mates to stay focused and play their position correctlyI wonder if the defenders had played that to the end would Ronaldo still had made that weak header or would he have done something different They would ve certainly got to that if they didn t stop playing EDIT Also that defender marking Ronaldo should probably try to keep an eye on his man
Id be furious as a manager if I saw that heck even as a fan Id be mad
heck Please watch your language
it s a family show
I don t give a crud
Just imagine what kind of foul language we d be seeing if he was the manager
You kiss your mother with that mouth
Makes me think of the WC qualifier knockout between Sweden and Portugal Guys this Ronaldo chap is pretty good keep an eye on him
yea to be honest that should have been stopped Also on side note you can clearly see the lack of form he is still in with that attempt on net A form ronaldo would have put a solid effort on net Regardless goal and hopefully it helps him and the rest of us get back up from that loss sat
I know Ronaldo s fast but that afro guy didn t even try there until the pass was already on it s way
that Shakhtar defender
Defender
Hooooooly shit imagine letting the best player in the world run into your box in acres of space Edit I guess I mean one of the best thanks for the downvotes you morons
Wow 20 downvotes for asserting that Ronaldo might be the best player in the world
i mean it really is an absurd contention at this point
Didn t see Messi in the video
What was that number 66 doing
Gee I think that s Ronaldo
Dude couldn t be bothered to track back 10 feet Would have been an easy clearance The center back too looks like he could ve got there but he gets caught giving up before the ball is even in Not that the goal was his fault though
It was actually number 99 doing a handstand
He looks more like a rugby player than a footballer
probably hoping it would lead to a counter attack didn t really work out
that defending reminded me of this IRL lag posted over at r gifs by u fromthepharcyde
He s to my right I got him
What a pass by Bale
Modrics pass That was magic
Wouldn t mind seeing Modric at Bar a
Dude what is wrong with you
The Croatian double team with Rakitic Triple with Kovacic It s sexual
Croatian here By watching them play at the Croatian national team I would say they would do fuck all with all due respect to them they are indivudually amazing players Never seen them mesh together well though
Am I sexuuallll yeeeaaahhh Am I everything you need you better rock your gameplay now
He is a benfiquista
Just thought it would be amazing to see him playing there not that I dislike him at Real
Could anyone explain to me why he s being downvoted to oblivion I m genuinely curious as I don t understand what is going on here S Edit I m relatively unknowledgeable which is why I m trying to learn more
Probably because of the rivalry between Barca and Real It s like saying I d like to see Marcelo at Barca or Pique at Real
Ah okay thanks for the answer I appreciate it
Not sure if he was trying a Nacho goal of his own
Pardon me if this is a joke but Bale was going for goal
LOL yes he did think he missed the goal
Does fantastic to spot the run and then be able to float it over
Much credit to Bale for Cristiano s goal
Huh Bale He made a simple pass which was actually just a wide shot The real credit for this goal should go to Modric not Bale or Ronaldo He created this goal solely Ronaldo and Bales part could be done by a U 13 to be honest
Not sure what U 13 would be able to make that run or chip that Bale did I think you are selling him very short
I don t think you realise which players are which in this clip
Not if you ask Cristiano at least in this clip
Hurr durr ronaldo is so selfish
Le arrogant Cristiano amirite
You idiot Edit that s all I could say initially This 10 second clip wasn t long enough to show the part where he serenades Bale
I would ve broken my skull on that post
As soon as ronaldo started running towards it I got scared
wtf was that dude doing trailing ronaldo as if he wasn t going to score
Well me must ve just thought Oh well in Benitez s system Ronaldo has about 1 5th the shots he usually does Especially now that Neymar Suarez and Messi are playing so well Cristiano likely suspects he won t make the the three man list for the Ballon D Or leading to a loss of spirits which along side his knee injury and age can be attributed to his loss of recent form that is a greater part of his decline No need to follow him here
And then Oh shit
You really put some thought into this huh
Felaini really let himself go
Good team goal
Im glad Bale is looking healthy Hopefully he can keep it up
Inzaghi would be proud
Quite bad defending do they not realize how fast Bale is Great play by Bale and Modric though
They guy covering Cristiano is the true criminal here if you ask me He just kinda watched as Cristiano ran passed him
Oh man what a pass from Modric
Impure
Fck that was close
Madrid doing their best impression of Barca s goal the other day
Tapinaldo
7 10 players would probably miss that
Yeah those open net shots from 6 inches are insanely hard
No they wouldn t
Those passes though
meh
Well that almost ended tragically
I WANT TO HAVE MODRICS BABIES
what is it with defenders just ignoring ronaldo and allowing him to stroll unmarked into scoring positions
Number 66 is good
knock off Marcelo definitely didn t help
wow Modric
the world is a better place when Cristiano Ronaldo is scoring goals
Defender 86 might wanna mark the second best player in the world a little closer than that Just a thought
Neymar played yesterday unless you mean Suarez who also played yeterday
Goddamn can t a guy make a joke on an internet forum without dickheads being all sanctimonious about arbitrary rankings of grown men Fuck s sake
Seems like you can t take a joke either m8
s Just bants man BANTZ
Unless you mean Iniesta
Is he dare I say it Back
Bale assists Ronaldo Ronaldo pretends Bale don t be here
That defender running with Bale was pathetic but he made up for it by kicking the ball out of the goal after it had crossed the line
what the ACTUAL FUCK was 66 doing what the fuck was he thinking
Typical goal by him But that pass by Modric though
Ronaldo goals lack the flair they used to come with These recent ones look like spoon fed boringness
how was the celebration
Reminds me kinda of Barca s fantastic MSN goal yesterday actually Great for Ronaldo though he really needed that bit of confidence
Reminds you in what exactly In both the ball went inside
He s most likely mentioning those over top sort of flick balls into the area
yes that I thought r soccer was football forum where people understood the game lol no
This sub is pretty bad for serious discussion
Only if you have a Real Madrid flair and or try to compare anything other than gods to Barcelona s players
your understanding of the game is so deep man You recognized a forward over the top pass as similar to another goal Can Real Madrid hire you already
Good one jackass
How can you not see the similarities
You tell me
Well both are goals scored in a Champions League football game if that s what you mean
Great for Ronaldo the new kid on the block seems to have the potential to now aim for greater heights and probably play for Segunda someday
Almost scored on the same play ten minutes later but the next time the keeper stayed in goal to save Ronaldo s header
dont thank bale
But all the couch managers here told me that Ronaldo should be benched I don t even know if those people were serious or just blinded by their hate of this man
Good point he really proved everyone wrong by heading it in unmarked from about 6 inches outside the goal World class finish Ronaldo showing his best definitely not Bale and Modric
Only the GOAT can score goal like that
He scored and that s enough Doesn t matter how We can t be 100 sure that this situation and goal would have occurred without Ronaldo Also I am not trying to put Bale or Modric down I m just saying that people that never touched a ball in their lives should not make stupid comments Even if it s biased or because they hate him it s still retarded to say that real should bench him
He scored and that s enough Everything that is wrong with football viewers in the past 5 10 years
You do know that the objective of football is to outscore an opponent If this is wrong with football viewers then what do you suggest is right
Have a holistic view of football Goals and assists are just the final 2 moves in a chain of events I am not gonna pretend that they are not important but to pontificate on them at the exclusion of everything else is what is wrong with football analysis at the moment I blame Messi and Ronaldo
Mate you re making that assumption of me based on this post alone I m not saying that goals are everything I m a defender and love clean tackles more than anything I m just saying when a player especially a forward scores a goal or two then he has done his job
He s hardly proved anyone wrong This is the kind of goal that someone in a slump can score without changing their future performances one bit because it doesn t do shit for confidence If someone who could actually make runs and be a threat offensively had started there is no way to be 100 sure it wouldn t be 0 3 already
Lol the last paragraph is enough for me to understand that you are probably one of those who do not watch his matches regularly but still like to shit on him
Your comment history is enough for me to understand that you have a reputation for starting and encouraging circlejerks in the past I understand it s new for you to be on the other side for once
Yeah unfortunately you ve come across Shaqiriii the one user you can guarantee will be at the bottom of every thread he comments in I d ignore the guy
Oh believe me I know who he is Just another guy who views reddit as a platform for starting arguments
That still does not change what I said You try to get back at me but it does not change that you re probably one of those couch managers that like to speak a lot without knowing much
I actually haven t said shit about Ronaldo before I saw your comment today I just thought you were just waiting for an opportunity to pretend like you re right about Ronaldo even if he doesn t actually perform well
I never said anything about Ronaldo s recent form so no I wasn t waiting for something like this to comment that I was right Check my history if you re bored and that interested in it or take my word for it
Of course not I wasn t implying that all 400k of us in r soccer were just watching for a comment by you specifically But I can guarantee that you had a preformed opinion about Ronaldo s form and you were waiting for anything that you thought would allow you to get upvoted via hivemind Unfortunately for you this isn t enough for a reasonable person to say that Ronaldo has regained his form So you got downvoted
American flair Your argument is invalid
America flair Your argument is invalid
Is it really
Asshole spotted comment worthless
American Real Madrid fan Argument is garbage
And so is your attitude Grow up
Yeah nobody else could ve scored an empty net header Maybe he deserved the bench maybe not but one easy goal against Shakhtar isn t a good indicator
He never deserves the bench Maybe he can be rested in unimportant matches but claiming that he should be benched is just either being biased or clueless Even he plays bad there is no replacement Who would he be benched for
People don t want to bench him because someone else plays better it s because the bench could motivate Ronaldo to work harder and get back in form It s not a difficult concept to understand managers do it all the time with underperforming stars Pique Enrique Hazard Mou
There are different ways to motivate players Playing bad should be enough motivation for him to get back to his level He is a hard worker and dedicated I don t think motivation is the problem Maybe it s his issues with his legs or the managers tactics not clicking but I do not think its motivation Who knows
Man you defend Ronaldo with all your heart Are you his publicist by the way Has he thanked you for it yet
Oh look it s my number one fan Nice to see you too
So I ll take it he hasn t thanked you Man must be hard you must spend several hours on the internet arguing and defending him only for him not to notice
Well at least you get some appreciation from me for being such a good fan So at least one of us is being thanked
TIL defending a player on Reddit being a good fan Damn why didn t nobody tell me going to away games is costly If someone had told me I could show my appreciation to my team just by defending a player on the internet I would gladly save up some money for more important things
Couch managers lol
A lot of Madrid fans who don t hate Ronaldo have also asked for him to be benched so it s not just people who hate this man
Lol madrid fans C mon man a lot of Real and Barca fans here are a bunch of gloryhunters that will turn on their stars as soon as they stop performing It s not only people here even in the stadiums in Spain they turn on their own players It s not like I think that a comment is more believable if a Real fan makes them or the other way around with Barca
I m not talking about reddit look at Madrid forums on the internet read what many are saying and many claim Ronaldo is past it and that he should be benched And yeah like you said the Bernab u as well My point is that people who have said Ronaldo should be benched are not always blinded by hatred like you stated
Fair enough but I said I don t know if they are serious or biased That means that it s worse if they re unbiased and serious in my opinion And both fanbases are not the most stable ones so I take whatever madrid and Barca fans say with a grain of salt
A tap and 5 on Soccer sad
I thought he was past it
Yup that was an incredible finish Definetly shows the true Cristiano is back
Haha I I was just joking
nah Ronaldo has ended his goal drought with this 3 yard screamer so all his critics have been proven wrongLes yeux dans les bleus is a really great football documentary
Yes Maybe one of the best there is
True
technically it is always one of the best
What No A bad documentary couldn t be technically considered as one of the best
why not Did you define how many are the best It can be part of the 10000 best
Then technically I m one of the world s best footballers
technically you are

no no didn t you watch he likes to fake to his left but then shifts to the right
Humble in the way they have no ego they accept that Ronaldo is superior I m commenting on why the video is specifically beautiful to me Ronaldo being amazing goes without saying
Would you say it s as beautiful as a gay swan Edit Fuck all y all I still think it s funny

A description of how Ronaldo plays Foo foo foo foo foo
And It s gone Children in Africa could ve eaten that ball
Best 9 ever I m not even kidding
It s crazy considering he was at his best when playing for Barcelona before his injuries He was like 21 Imagine how good he would have been without injuries
He was so amazing that even later in his career when he was fat as fuck burdened by years of injuries and hypothyroidism he was scoring like just a regular world class player at Milan and one of the highest scorers in the WC He had set such high standards that all people could talk about late career Ronaldo was how shit he was
Even when at Real Madrid he was amazing yet nowhere near as good as his earlier years A lot of people seem to think his prime was at Real Madrid when he was actually much better at PSV Barca and Inter
Imagine what would happen if he stayed at Barcelona and later teamed up with Kluivert Jesus Christ
One season at Barca 47 goals in 49 games Then he left for a better contract no fucks given
Puskas and Gerd Muller would like a word They d all be up there though
Muller was an excellent goal scorer but that s it The purest poacher the world has ever seen but not a pure 9 like Ronaldo
I want my striker number 9 whatever you call him to score goals If he does it by dribbling past three players and scoring or poaching them it s the same result I would take the flashier one there But Gerd Muller also scored much more goals than Ronaldo so that weighs in his favor I guess for a game in their prime I would take Ronaldo Over a career I d take Muller Puskas was a good mix of both though
It s silly to compare Puskas and Muller to Ronaldo and declare who the better 9 is Let s not act like all 3 didn t put up video game numbers The former two might have scored 3 goals per match with their dicks but I don t think a pure poacher could ever pull that off in Ronaldo s era
M ller was pretty good at everything actually His goals were typical poacher goals but he was fairly involved in the game
Well its whatever works Ronaldo may be one of the best players i ve ever been alive to see but i ve seen better strikers Suarez for one may actually be one of the best strikers i ve seen in a long time in that he s incredibly intelligent incredibly consistent and incredibly athletic The best player i ve ever seen is Messi best playmaker i ve ever seen is a tough one but i d give it to Iniesta or Zidane and best forward is a toss up between Ronaldo or Cristiano Ronaldo Best dribbler has to be Ronaldinho but I ve seen Neymar one up him once or twice Its nice to look at our childhood heroes with a nostalgic nod but Ronaldo s career was plagued with injuries and a little more disappointment than a lot of people care to remember He was the focal point of one of the most talented squads in recent history which is a high honor in itself But as far as pure 9s go i ve seen better Shevchenko for example was a better striker Ronaldo was definitely more talented but goals are goals
u wot
The same people who think Ronaldo is the undisputed best striker of all time ever are the same people that think Ronaldinho is a top 10 player Paul Scholes is the best midfielder of his generation and Zidane is the sleeper hit of his generation There have been better strikers than Ronaldo as early as Thierry Henry in 2004 While his technique was flawless and his athleticism was incredible at one point he merely set the standard a standard that has been reached more than once in the last decade I fully accept anybody people calling him what he is a legend but being il fenomino doesn t make you the best of all time ever His entire career was defined by 8 years 1994 2002 8 nearly perfect years but there have been better scorers better forwards and faster players side then
Rofl Here is Luis Enrique s last week interview about Ronaldo I d seen him on television at PSV and thought wow Then he came to Barcelona He s the most spectacular player I ve ever seen He did things I d never seen before We re now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players but not then
Wow Current Barcelona manager has nothing but praise for former teammate and club legend Ronaldo Seriously People need to relax
Shearer too
Suarez will be in with a shout in a few years if he isn t already
how old are you if you don t mind me asking Ive watched r9 in his prime and currently enjoying suarez While suarez will no doubt go down as one of the great forwards R9 will for a long time be the best ever to play in the position There is no arguing this fact what he did back then was ridiculous Remember this was also an era when little touch didn t end of being called a foul An era when slide tackling was such a big part of the game It was a golden era for defenders
Asking his age comes across as a little condescending The things Suarez has achieved especially after only recently coming into a top team are incredible He s a magnificent player and his all around work effort I m sure puts Ronaldo s to shame Suarez is only 28 and if he maintains this level and remains injury free for another 4 years or so then we would truly be talking about one of if not the greatest strikers ever
lol not how i meant it what i meant was if he got a chance to see ronaldo on live tv or even live but yea
Team achievements shouldn t decide which player was better Ronaldo dominated La Liga at age 19 or 20 Suarez was having a good debut season in the Eredivisie at that age I m not sure if your age comment means that you really haven t watched him back in the day but if not I can only recommend watching some video footage of him He really wasn t called el fenoemno for nothing Even after his injury he was still playing on an incredible level so there will always be this big if concerning what could have been sadly And I definitely know how good Suarez is
LOL NO
I m 27 I m the perfect age to have some childhood bias for R9 Suarez is very close if not as good He s been dominating leagues for years
Suarez is not any where near as prolific but the comparison bears merit if only because they have a VERY similar playing style
I m 35 Suarez is miles away from the best Ronaldo The Ronaldo at Barcelona was not just the best player around he totally and utterly dominated the game He was unplayable
He carried mediocre Inter squad to ultra competitive Seria A in his first year only finishing 2nd due to controversial match vs Juve Also carried them to win UEFA cup Suarez is a beast but Ronaldo prior his 2x knee injuries was just on whole another level
controversial Nice euphemism
I think people tend to give more weight to what they see now R9 was truly one of the most dominant players I ve even seen And I m old
The sentiment that Suarez is as good or better as ronaldo was would ve been extremely dumb in the time period between 2010 and 2012 where he helped take Uruguay to the World Cup semi finals and the Copa America title and it would ve been just a tad controversial when he took Liverpool to a second place finish with a POTY worthy display But a treble and a clasico rout later I don t think its fair to undersell him any longer Suarez is exceptional and any notion that he isn t at Ronaldo s level is just weird I m not actually sure if there s anything Ronaldo could do back in the day that Suarez can t do now The only thing separating them is 3 biting incidents and a bit of racism
Ronaldo is still a class above believe it or not The speed power control finishing
not even close
Suarez is awesome deffo 1 striker right now I still believe R9 was the most talented forward out there though He was basically an upgraded Suarez faster stronger with better ball control 34 goals in 37 matches for Barcelona at age 21 Phenomenal And then injuries hit Also is it just me or did Suarez get smaller in Barcelona He was a boar in Liverpool and now he looks lanky
He may look less bulky but he s as strong as ever
Not really Probably not even top 10 since 2000
Name 10 better since 2000 then
I m not really agreeing with u KrisDoolan but this seemed a nice exercise to do so here we go I did not include CR7 because I consider him more a winger than a 9 Otherwise he d obviously be with the 5 guys above Suarez Players I ranked above Suarez ie if I ran a team and had to choose between prime Suarez and prime player X I d go for player X without thinking about it too much Ronaldo Raul Henry Messi Rooney Players that I rank kind of the same level as Suarez with the same reasoning as above I d have to think a long time before choosing between prime Suarez and prime player X Ibrahimovic Shevchenko Van Nistelrooy Drogba Eto o Totti Tevez Aguero Pre Chelsea Torres Benzema
Half the strikers you listed are mostly known for exceptional finishing They are essential for turning a really good team into a great team The wonderful thing about Suarez though is that he brings so much more than just scoring goals to the table He is absolutely essential for Barca s pressing He was playing both finisher and playmaker for Liverpool When Suarez left Liverpool they simply could not fill the hole in the team The other players you mentioned were wonderful players but teams can cope fairly well when they lose strikers like Van Nistelrooy Raul and Shevchenko
Of the prime player X in the first scenerio only Henry Messi and Ronaldo have a case against Suarez Of the 10 in the second pool only Shevchenko has a case Suarez is comfortably better than all the rest Rooney was great in his prime but nothing to write home about Drogba is my fav striker but Anelka was always better he s just a better captain Eto o Tevez Totti and Ibrahimovich are cult icons but they re not without competition Aguero Benzema Torres and Van Nistelrooy have always been effective and efficient but Suarez has always played a much bigger and better role for club and country And Raul wasn t that good Having scoring records doesn t make you the best striker ever He was great but Real Madrid had no problem replacing him or Van Nistelrooy for that matter when the time came I d liken them to Inzaghi great club legend not the best striker None of them compare to Suarez in the slightest
Del Piero Vieri Van Basten Baggio Bergkamp Batistuta They would all be above Suarez I d say
Rooney even at his prime better than Suarez lol
Props for putting in the effort Would take Suarez ahead of Rooney and Raul Also ahead of Shevchenko RVN Dorgba Totti Tevez Torres probably Karim as well Only one on that list I would absolutely without question take ahead of Suarez would be Messi and he s not actually a striker
Ronaldo Henry Van Nistelrooy prime Shevchenko prime Torres Raul Ibrahimovic Eto o Del Piero Aguero
good list you forgot prime Falcao comparing him to Ronaldo fenomeno is just silly they are different worlds
I was going to mention Falcao because he was an absolute monster at Atletico but I believe this is only his second ever season of Champions League football so I was kind of reluctant to put him in there
I d rather have him on my team over everyone else except maybe Henry Ronaldo and prime Shevchenko
Definite no on Van Nistlerooy Shevchenko Torres Raul Eto o Del Piero Aguero Other three are maybe s at best
I m sorry but motherfucking Ronaldo is not a maybe at best I think you re either massively exaggerating how good Suarez is or you don t remember just how good some of those players were Van Nistelrooy especially had a much better scoring record especially in the Champions League likewise with Shevchenko Raul and Eto o
Nostalgic revisionism I think you re overrating a number of those players especially RVN Sheva Raul
Ruud set a number of records for his goalscoring exploits and had an absolutely ridiculous record in Europe same goals per game as Messi and higher than Ronaldo Shevchenko won the Ballon d Or and is Milan s 2nd all time top scorer only behind Gunnar Nordahl It took Messi and Ronaldo until last year to beat Raul s CL goals record He was Real Madrid s top scorer ever until the start of the season Suarez has achieved shit compared to them
Trying not to be biased but you are really underestimating Del Piero one of the best Italian players to every play the game
What could ve been Ironic that both he and Ronaldo arguably the two most promising and best strikers in the world at that time would end up having their career ruined by their knees
Why would you be kidding He is the best number 9 of all time
I still don t think Brazil would ve won if Ronaldo was fully fit in the final but they would have played much better in attack
Its simple break his fucking legs
Thanks Roy Keane
FOU FOU FOU
Nice Fortunately for them Ronaldo ended up playing one of his worst ever games in that final
Well his name wasn t even on the teamsheet before the match it was a last minute decision to play him Doctor Lidio Toledo revealed the striker had been rushed to hospital after suffering a convulsion in his sleep but cleared to play after neurological and cardiac tests Such a shame really http news bbc co uk sport3 worldcup2002 hi history newsid 1749000 1749324 stm EDIT Also many other theories as to what happened the night before
There s a strong rumour that he was forced to play by sponsors most notably Nike
This
to this day I still believe the rumors that he was poisoned by the French in their hotel
he was definitely not 100 in that match The disparity between the final and the previous games is absurd Like two completely different players
Probably shouldn t have played at all
Cool seeing them all giddy like a fan would be seeing skill like that up close
Why is this unverified
This is amazing
Watching him in his prime was mesmerizing Just simply unplayable regardless of the talent you put against him

Getting clowned on by that haircut would be roughReminder for you all This summer only Marseille lost Ayew Gignac Imbula Payet Thauvin to foreign clubs Plus Morel to Lyon Monaco lost Abdenour Berbatov Carrasco Falcao Kondogbia Martial to foreign clubs Kurzawa and Ocampos to PSG and Marseille Nantes lost Gakp Djilobodji Veretout to foreign clubs Saint Etienne lost Gradel Tabanou Erding to foreign clubs Plus Lyon losing Njie Lorient J Ayew Bordeaux Mariano Teams are constantly rebuilding Marseille and Monaco the worst this year EDIT This summer Ligue 1 has a 126 85 M gain on transfer Taking into account PSG and Lyon without them it s 239 15M which is 13 29M average to see the whole team being decimated Max is Monaco with 94 2M including the 80M Martial money QPR won 90M in TV Deal only last year Chelsea 136M
OM also lost Fanni and Lemina
Considering how big the population of France is it s strange how they never produced elite teams like Spain England Germany and Italy They ve had sporadic success but nothing consistent
That has nothing to do with population though Portugal has 10 million inhabitants and they have successfull teams in an european scale Aside from PSG french teams are not attractive enough because we do not have enough money to pay premier league like wages due to fiscality low tv rights deals less attractivity
My point is going back to the start of European football why did no huge teams develop in France like they did in other countries The national team wasn t great either until the 80s
Because historically rugby was a bigger sport in France than football
Oh ok I knew rugby was popular in France but had no idea it was actually bigger than football
Higher percentage of the French population plays rugby than in NZ In the south especially it s all rugby country
The french rugby league top 14 is the biggest rugby league in the world
In the southwest this is true but absolutely not anywhere north of the Loire and at least doubtful in the southeast
I don t think there s any way around the fact that France is an outlier The top 4 leagues are 4 of the 5 most populous nations in Western Europe Portugal may have strong teams league relative to population size but they re still well behind Spain England Germany and Italy
I was once told that in France the taxes alone of you declare over 1M income are upwards of 50 and to keep the big names happy and staying in PSG the Qataris actually cover those extra taxes for the players Not sure how true it is though
Not enough money Atletico s budget is comparable to that of Marseille and Lyon and they reached the CL final while OL and OM have a combined 0 1 10 in their last CL games Also was money the problem when Lyon got ONE point out of 6 against Gent When they were eliminated by APOEL When they were eliminated by Astra Giurgiu When PSG couldn t qualify for EL s round of 32 in a group with Slovan Bratislava and Red Bull Salzburg Let me be clear Ligue 1 sucks and PSG s titles have never felt so hollow But quit trying to find excuses for your poor management French football has never been at a lowest point in decades PSG is our only ray of light but then again We are owned by a dictatorship This situation sucks so much I fucking hate it
Actually Atletico s budget is around 190 million euros Marseille for this season has a budget of 125 million euros A huge part of the budget is dedicated to salaries As a fellow french you should know that the fiscality is very high compared to Spain Marseille for instance had to renovate their stadium same can be said for Lyon with their new stadium It is estimated that Marseille lost 26 million euros over 3 years because of that don t know about Lyon but given it is their stadium and they paid for it the loss is huge Also we had to sell key players this summer so we could conform with FFP regulations Gignac left for free Payet Imbula Ayew left Nkoulou and Mandanda will be leaving FOR FREE at the end of the season We can not just pay premier league like wages because we simply do not have the money to Sure there is probably a problem in terms of management but for some reason and probably others I m far from being knowledgeable on the subject we lack the money to compete internationaly Best clubs are the richest that s all
We lack the money to compete internationally How do you explain that Portuguese clubs constantly trample ours That teams from Cyprus eliminated OL and Nice Danish club eliminated Saint Etienne
French clubs tend not to take europa league seriously because there is little financial reward with a huge investment given that there is way more fixtures in an already overbooked schedule See Christophe Galtier comment a year ago or so Portuguese clubs bring very talented players from south america through third party ownership and anyway the transfer fee is low Plus their academy is on point
That s true but I don t what your point is Are you saying that money isn t the main problem and Portuguese clubs are much better managed than us
I was just explaining why they have more success than us with a lower budget
Well that s kind of my point isn t it If we recruited better and if we took Europe more seriously we wouldn t be in this situation
Incomparable
Comparable In 2013 2014 Atletico s budget was 170M Marseille s 130 One went to the Final of the CL the other 0 0 6 in the group stages
Ah I see what you mean although there are other factors to consider as well
Of course of course But we in France always like to blame it on money I m saying that s really not our main problem
It is very strange only one winner in all of European Cup Champions League history
When has the EPL had consistent success in Europe outside of 04 09
Through the 70s and 80s across each competition
How so
A team in the european cup final 9 times between 1975 1985 7 times winners Spread across 4 different teams imagine any league doing the same now
Look up European Cup finals between 1976 and 1985
Ah I took his statement to mean two decades of dominance though I think the run was from 76 84
England were solid from 70 76 dominant from 76 85 and probably would have continued to be for a little while if not for the Heysel disaster
England were solid from 70 76 Might want to extend that window a bit m8 I mean who could forget our stunning Inter Cities Fairs Cup victory over jpesti D zsa in 1969
English and German teams pretty much exclusively dominated European football in the 70s and 80s until Heysel
The fact that almost none of them own their own stadia and rent from local councils really holds them back
Don t forget that Lyon also have Fekir unavailable due to his torn ACL that he got two months ago
Saint Etienne also sold Maximin to Monaco if that counts
So you are saying the league is shit Except for PSG
The league is poor
Ligue 1 is being bought out by the big 4 leagues but it s France s fault Why aren t French clubs offering bigger contracts bar PSG
LOL Clubs can t type rosebud IRL you re pretty much asking why a single mom working as a waitress can t buy a Lambo
Euuh because they don t have the money You know that with all the taxes a player costs to his Ligue 1 club 17 times what he would cost to a spanish club And if the player ends up being injured or shit DNCG will make sure you re relegated France is not Spain
It s France s fault exactly Not French clubs fault Here over 1M a year 50 goes to the country Under it s more complicated but let s say about 25 So if you want a player to earn 5M a year the club has to pay 9 5M approximately And I have probably forgotten A LOT of things I actually don t know shit about this juste it s super high tax here for high salaries Plus French club aren t wealthy compared to English clubs because English clubs are the main problem Spanish German Italian too but mainly English PS I love MKP Was a big fan during the MKP DRG area at MLG

PSG should just start playing David Luiz as striker just for laughs
Fifa irl
That s not healthy
Not for my blood pressure certainly
This kills the Ligue 1
Solution Espanyol and Barcelona to Ligue 1
Blame it on PSG if you want but Lyon only has 25 points after 14 games that s really not a lot for a 2nd
So everyone in the league is bad It s just PSG are average
I d rather say everyone in the league is average beside PSG who are good Nice lost against Ajaccio and Nantes but went to beat Lyon and Marseille for example PSG can afford to keep their best players which brings stability Marseille and Monaco lost half their team during summer Only Lyon kept their players wages were raised but eventually they lost F kir
Didn t Monaco lose half their team due to a change in policy They have plenty of money right They could have retain some players
It s a mixture of things but they definitely did want to mix up their squad a bit to hopefully get a better project going They let go of a lot of prospects that they felt were not panning out like Ocampos for example We lost half our squad because the club isn t very profitable any more Ayew and Labrune tried several times to extend his contract and our owner simply doesn t give a shit any more They netted 50m off of the sales of our squad this summer and she s going to sell as soon as someone offers
Things haven t been going that great for OM a shame that s happening to a team as great as you I really hope you regain your rightful place in Ligue 1
Eh thanks for the kind words but we have no right to anything in the league We get what we deserve and it s not weird that we are doing poorly given the circumstances It looks like Michel finally figured things out last weekend so I m hoping things will begin to improve
They had to sell some to break even per FFP but Martial wasn t supposed to be sold but given the 80 million offer it was impossible to reject
Why does Monaco lose so many players Aren t they still supported by a rich suggardaddy
Beside this divorce story he eventually did not lost half his money to his ex wife as far as I know they have to sell because of FFP AS Monaco because of its history has many fans in the whole France they ve one of the best away crowd But the home stadium is empty because Monaco is small and full of rich people And this can t work with FFP
He s lost basically nothing to his wife she is in huge debt and will have to completely capitulate at this point he has offered her half of what he originally offered her at the beginning of proceedings and only for 10 years rather than the rest of her life and she ll have to take it His daughter sided against the mother and basically shot down most of her case The issue is that he is happy to spend money as he has shown but he will not spend money if it means he ll have to pay millions in fines to UEFA so the policy shifted from big name star signings to young players with a lot of potential and Jardim with complete control of the squad and transfers along with a Portuguese scout he brought with him They buy low sell high and it will allow a core of players to develop and sell off one or two each season to cover the loss a like Lyon 10 years ago except a bigger safety net So they sold a lot of players one more than they wanted to Martial but obviously with 80 million on the table it was impossible to reject but the project isn t over
Yup you explained their change of policy and their new project well The only thing is that given the context it s even more difficult to create a chemistry between players in Monaco imo They had it last year and they sold everyone I doubt they can create this every year And when you bring in so many new players the risk is to miss on the CL spots Less exposure for the players and you can t sell too high beside they don t buy thaaat low they buy pretty high and want to sell very high
Makes sense I just wish that they d balanced the team better I mean yeah sell Martial for that crazy fee but then buy a good centre back and a good LB RB and another DM Then they d probably be okay Instead they have like 20 wingers and attacking midfielders and two 35 year olds playing defence
Sugardaddy that lost half his money to his ex wife IIRC
That wasn t true actually
Ok my mistake then The thing is he doesn t want to spend huge money on Monaco now so they are more a seller club than a buyer like any club in France other than Lyon or Paris The fact that English clubs are drunk with money that the french taxes cost a lot to the clubs makes the best players of the league go away and team are constantly rebuilding Plus this season PSG are performing good and all the others quite badly explaining this Actually PSG point per game is lower than Bayern per instance but Lyon has really few points for a 2nd after 14 games
We play bad while PSG play how they should with the budget they have They only have 2 draws and no loses so far
Mid and low table clubs are doing surprisingly well hello Nice and Angers Top table clubs are doing quite bad JUST LOOK AT MY CREST
It s that PSG is excellent and that other middle sized team especially Lyon Marseille and Monaco had a pretty rough start
Off topic but I can t wait to see Red Star get promoted and have a Paris derby in Ligue 1 do you think it could happen soon
Red Star is currently 6th 4 points behind Metz 3rd I honestly think it s going to be complicated this year especially since the games have to be played in Beauvais as Stade Bauer doesn t suit the league s standards But for a club like Red Star there s no need to rush sometimes it s better to spend a few years in Ligue 2 before playing with the big boys especially because of DNCG Red Star doesn t have a strong financial back up like Paris FC with fuckin Vinci
Seriously We don t blame it on PSG because we want we blame it on PSG because this is without a doubt entirely their fault PSG fans have nothing to do with it though you can t expect them to want their team to not win every game
PSG fault if teams like Lyon or Marseille underperform terribly They should have much more points by now and this thread wouldn t exist Lyon Marseille Monaco all have budgets above 100M Caen and Angers 25M Lyon lost against La Gantoise I think it s around 30M Those teams are underperforming I can t see how this is without a doubt entirely PSG fault
Can we just stop the season and call it a wrap right now I mean we all know what s going to happen the rest is just filler crap like Dragon Ball Z
Nah dude it s too interesting for us We could be top 6 or relegated nobody knows
I for one hope relegated Imagine the clusterfuck
Honestly it would just be the current clusterfuck amplified a bit and might even help get the club sold So oddly enough I m not as afraid of that as I should be Besides won t you miss the Aluas Labrune bantz
Imagine Aulas twitter with Labrune in Ligue 2 though That s just sounds like Christmas
I think we re forgetting there probably would be no more Labrune if we were relegated at least there better not be He could go to ASSE for continued banter
I would be ok with that even though CL football may kill us straight away
On the one hand Lyon have 25 points in 14 games so 25 42 which is poor for second place On the other PSG have 38 42 which is also huge That s what leads to such a disparity an extraordinarily good 1st place team but also a very mediocre second team
That is one of the consequence of the EPL being so rich The best french players used to leave France for the big 4 now they even leave top 5 teams in France to play bottom teams in England The only team that can keep its players is PSG Then english fan complain that it is easier for PSG in champion s league because Ligue1 is uncompetitive But you created the monster
Let s see there s Thauvin going to Newcastle the Ayews going to Swansea and Villa Hazard and Zouma going to Chelsea so yeah players from top 5 teams in France are leaving to play for relegation zone teams except for Swansea of course
You glossed over Payet to West Ham Azpilicueta and Remy to Chelsea
Remy left Marseille for QPR
He took the long way
I think the conversation was only about bottom half teams so fair shout on the Chelsea ones but Payet is going to a much more relevant club in West Ham which is understandable
Amavi Vertout to Villa as well
I spy the hidden bantz
Big 4 being Real Barca Bayern United
Maybe he means big 4 in England Arsenal Chelsea City United in recent memory
I think in this context the big 4 refers to Arsenal Chelsea United and Liverpool
Sky 4
Arsenal Leicester City United FTFY
Arsenal Leicester City United Leicester City so good they take up two spots in the top 4
No dude I was talking about Bristol City
Wait not Norwich City the ones who put a mighty 2 past Newcastle and constantly produce goals of the season
Fucking Norwich Hell no
I think he meant Lyon Marseille and maybe Lille and PSG
What are you talking about We had to sell Gameiro Nullifying our chances of european victory forever
Kind of off topic but what the hell happened to Lyon They used to be a top team in Europe and roll Ligue 1 year after year and now they are bottom of their group in the CL behind powerhouses like Zenit and Gent and haven t won the league since 2008
Lyon had a formidable upcoming in the mid 2000 s Very well managed They started making good money and saved it Then they for some unexplained reason they splashed all of their cash on Kader Keita 2007 16 Million Ederson 2008 14 million Jean II Makoun 2008 14 million John Mensah 2008 9 million Michel Bastos 2009 18 million Yoann Gourcuff 2010 26 5 million Pretty much every single one of them was a flop Then they decided it was the perfect time to build a stadium BOOOM
All you need to know
This is a good perspective but really only addresses the past couple seasons I m wondering more why they went from historically dominant in the mid 2000 s to where they are now Certainly the rise of PSG and their unlimited funds has something to do with it in the most recent seasons but they were falling from glory even before that for some reason They won 7 straight titles from 2002 2008 which is pretty amazing
they are bulding their own stadium so their last big transfert 30m was hm gourcuf in 2010 but he fails with injurys less than 30 full games played in 5 five years since 2011 they are only on young players and own formation lacazet fekir grenier gonallon martial but sold to monaco like arsenal did during many years
But we went to finish second in the ligue with 8 of our starter being formed at the club Lopes Umiti Gonalons Ferri Tolisso Grenier Lacazette Fekir If only we could form more defender instead of buying shitty player for 8 millions But guess they don t sell for the same amount so are not worth
They started overpaying for average players That s what shocked me the most And when talks about FFP began they decided to invest on a new stadium which will be finished soon Meanwhile they mostly had to rely on their academy players Ligue 1 s lack of attractivity didn t help them As well as the rise of Bordeaux and Lille

Interesting read
PSG have been able to sleepwalk through the league so far Even their bad performances have been mostly unpunished This is more indicative of the exodus in talent this year I don t expect it to stay this way next season
Yeah especially since many PSG players will play this summer You could see last season that PSG poor start was due to the players being tired and injury proned after the World Cup While OM players looked very very strong physically
Remember when they lost to Caen last year Good days
Owww you
I surely do inb4 it happens again

Can t get away from the viral Bernie Sanders marketing anywhere on this site
Reddit has to do it because no one else will Hillary will probably win the nomination pretty easily in the real world she is much more recognizable Not that I would mind Sanders as president but this site is it s own little bubble You would have thought Ron Paul was going to be president last time this was the only place you read about American politics
I was just having a good natured pop at our old troubling but useful friend Modern Capitalism
First time I ve been on Reddit for Months and live in a Red State Bernie is pretty popular Favorite to win the Democratic nomination No At this point he is more than a dark horse However will young people get out to vote in the primaries History says probably not
PSG seem like they really need Ronaldo next season
How s that
It was sarcastic There s a lot of speculation over Ronaldo going to PSG and clearly PSG seem to be doing fine without one of the best players on the planet
I believe he s referring to how Real Madrid are starting to play worse with him on the pitch than if someone else who is younger and not nursing a chronic knee injury would be playing
Lyon won Ligue 1 7 times back to back this is nothing

Noice
Inb4 PSG is ruining the league
You fucking are though Like seriously I like that you re playing well in Europe but watching the league is a fucking chore with your Qatari whores ruining the integrity of football
Your club did the same for 7 years though And you used to buy the best players from Ligue 1 thus weakening the league
Oh yeah totally similar situations Aulas is some foreign prince that injected a shitload of money in the club There s a difference between strategic presidents and sugar daddies
Precisely situations are not the same Lyon bought the best players from other Ligue 1 teams to secure their 1rst spot every year PSG brings in international stars which increases the TV rights on par with Germany can you imagine which makes more money for Lyon and the other clubs PSG does have shitload of money It doesn t mean this money isn t used as wisely as it can be QSI s strategy is pretty neat if you ask me Aulas is the best president in France It doesn t mean he didn t make big mistakes that cost a lot to OL Cissoko 15M remember
Lyon bought the best players from other Ligue 1 teams to secure their 1rst spot every year You re saying that as if it was easy and we just overspent everbody else they wanted to come here because they believed in what Aulas was creating most of them at least because had we ended up getting Pauleta or Drogba we d probably have a CL Budget wise PSG and Marseille were close to us Nowadays PSG spend 5 times more than anybody else that s not comparable We bought Essien Malouda and Abidal when they were unproven outside of France to Bastia Guimgamp and Lille not really contenders back then Paris buys Ibra Di Maria D Luis Cavani Thiago Silva just the same right We dominated because other big clubs were badly ran now the other big clubs don t even have a chance
Yeah you have some good points Although I think Aulas didn t really want Pauleta he just wanted to destabilize PSG back then by offering him a lot of money Essien Malouda and Abidal are good examples Shame you couldn t capitalize on the successes of this policy who knows what your budget would be like today Instead Aulas started overpaying for average players He was also unlukcy with Gourcuff Ofcourse with all this money PSG is supposed to lead the league But this thread is about those 13 points between PSG and Lyon This shows more about how the other big clubs are underperforming And honestly Marseille and even Lyon since a few years are badly run too
How are we badly run We had to trim the salary bill a lot starting around 2011 to pay for the new stadium so Aulas gambled on going young and we have finished 4 3 5 2 in those rebuilding years now we re back to regular spending We ll see if we can consistently play the CL now
Mostly the choice of players and the money spent to bring them since a few years including this summer with the exception of the very last few seasons when you pretty much entirely relied on your youth system You save money for years and you splash it out to bring it Beauvue and Valbuena Brilliant choice Glad if you re satisfied with that
Don t forget about Yanga Mbiwa He cost them around 10M if I m not mistaken
So one bad transfer window analyzed after 4 months makes a club badly run K Also splash it out Under 10M combined so David Luiz s left arm That s making it rain
Strong but fair Like a tackle from Puyol
Except the fact that Lyon havent exactly beng doing well in the league have they Lyon dont play PSG every week so cant blame them there same goes to all the other teams Last year Lyon finished 8 points behind PSG in the league with monaco only 4 points behind Lyon That seems like a pretty normal league standing doesnt it Same thing happened with Chelsea last season City finished 8 behind them Would you say Chelsea are ruining the league This Fuck PSG they are ruining the french league circle jerk needs to fuck off Everyone under PSG is under performing compared to last season and thats not PSG s fault is it Monaco have spent a shit load to get to where they are and no one complains about them
Paris under performed a lot in the league last year and they still had 8 points over a team which surprinsingly over performed
So its their fault Got it When Chelsea went undefeated for a massive amount of time last year were they ruining the league The teams under PSG are dropping a lot of points and Lyon has only 7 wins from 14 games Thats half of their games have been dropped points and they are 2nd Like I said just because the rest of the league is under performing isn t PSG s fault Bayern Munich have been very solid in recent years are they ruining the Bundesliga
Why are you bringing up Chelsea and Bayern The point is when a team overwhelmingly dominates financially every other member of the league it s playing in there s obviously no surprise on who s going to win It s like Juve s year in Serie B every other team knew they weren t playing for first place So yeah in a sense you can argue that it s ruining the league because even on match day 1 there s no suspense on who will end up winning
Im bringing up Chelsea and Bayern because they are relatively similar to PSG Bayern have been dominating the bundesliga for years but no one crys about them do they Do they say they are ruining the league What about Chelsea they were undefeated for a good portion of last year and were unchallenged really and have spent a lot compared to other teams but once again no one says they ruin the league So whats with all the PSG hate Ligue 1 teams under PSG are under poerforming and you cant deny that even though you dont mention it at all You can talk about PSG ruining the league but Monaco spent a shit load of money to get to where they are now and like I said just because you spend money doesnt guarantee success you guys were 8 points from them last year and were on top at one point so what there What about when Atletico Madrid won the league They arent exactly even financially when it comes to Madrid Barca are they I dont know where the circle jerk came from but there are so many teams that the same could be said about but PSG seems to get all the shit
Decades of success domestic and European got Bayern there There are about 4 5 different teams in England with financial means comparable to Chelsea s so it s competitive PSG has no competition in the league and got there because some guys decided to invest hundreds of millions in a club How is that fair estimate by Le Parisien of clubs operating budget for this season They spend as much as the next 4 combined how am I supposed to believe we or anybody else can compete
They spend as much as the next 4 combined how am I supposed to believe we or anybody else can compete Because you came within 8 points of them last year Even so it still doesnt explain dropping points in half of your games this year you cant blame you being 11 points behind on PSG you guys are playing poorly Also Man City and Chelsea spend considerably more than other teams bar united but they arent succesful in recent years so its not really competitive between 4 teams then is it
This is inevitably what happens when one team in a league has ambitions to step up to compete at elite level and gets the funds to do so CL has severely distorted national leagues in the last 10 years Even if Lyon or OM were performing as expected they still would be unable to maintain over the course of a season i e look at 14 15 So I can totally see the point of people getting angry about this when it is clear that no other team has the means to challenge
They don t have more ambitions they have a fuckload more money than us
Yeah wanting to win the Champions League and building bit by bit a squad capable of doing it that s not ambition at all
Where did I not say that I hate ambition arguments that fans of massive clubs use to blame other teams for a lack of competition I just meant it s what is to be expected when one team is chosen by the Arabian oil gods to get rich and challenge at a continental level The owners don t give a fuck about the domestic league
You know that s not true if Fournier had any ambitions you wouldn t finish 4th of group H against Valencia Zenit Gent Yes the lack of money is an issue but it s not the only one Ligue 1 teams have recently 5 years underperformed in European Competitions Now PSG became a rich club in Ligue 1 with mostly foreign players and reach quarter finals every year If we had more than 3 French players in the starting squad I don t think we would go far in CL Lyon did poor investments during their mercato You were unlucky to loose F kir but a club can t rely only on one player You kept an average manager who hasn t any European competitions experience I don t see any ambitions at all when I see Lyon picking ex Marseille average footballers or the 2nd choice from Serie A PL
You kept an average manager Who finished second in his first season after taking a team that finished fifth the previous season And you are the epitome of a PSG fan Oh so poor investments why didn t you buy Neymar or Boateng You can afford that We buy fucking second string Serie A and PL players because it s the best we can afford This isn t fucking Football Manager where we can buy some kid from Brazil and expect miracles this is real life I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us
why didn t you buy Neymar or Boateng We buy fucking second string Serie A and PL players because it s the best we can afford Kader Keita 2007 16 Million Ederson 2008 14 million Jean II Makoun 2008 14 million John Mensah 2008 9 million Michel Bastos 2009 18 million Yoann Gourcuff 2010 26 5 million You are the epitome of a OL fan Arrogant pretentious and ignorant T es vraiment un gros gros mais alors un gros de chez gros blaireau toi
come on guys hug it out um marchons marchons
I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us I don t see that happening anytime soon
I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us And then Ligue 1 can go the way of the Eredivisie or the Brasileiro Sure routinely losing your best footballers as soon as they show the slightest bit of potential will hurt the league more than the investment QSI has brought tv package comparable to Germany and not too far off Spain benefiting everyone but at least PSG won t have a lot of money
can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us What a great comment
Woeful league save Zlatan and get him out of there A S A P
That s the most inaccurate comment on Ligue 1 I ve ever seen in here
It s difficult to make any accurate comment when you are being overwhelmed by hormones I mean give the poor guy a break suddenly becoming pubescent is a very unsettling thing in someone s life
Ok without us Ligue 1 Arsenal would be a shit club but whatever
To be fair so would many teams in the Premier League
Especially Newca oh they re already shit
Another flop in the CL and PSG will surely start to lose their financial backing French football is abysmal
French football is abysmal but I m not sure PSG have really flopped in the CL in the past few years We got trampled by Barcelona last year but well who didn t
The year before that they lost to us on away goals and the year before it was Barca also on away goals Hardly flops pretty unlucky in all honesty
Boring leagueModric s first goal from inside the box with Madrid
luka modric scores me wipes away tear with one hand and fist pumps with the other while silently mouthing my boy
He s just a player that s hard to hate It s crazy to think that If he didn t score that wonder goal vs Manchester Utd a few years ago that he probably would have been sold
My bae
Watching modric score is like watching an angel get its wings
was this his first goal inside the box for real madrid
yes
was the keeper under arrest
Just got my Modric kit in the mail yesterday perfect timing His tempo today was great very good linkup and forward pressing
Lukas first goal in over a year
Fuckin finaly He has so amazing shot and he just never uses it for some reason
Gorgeous finish
Modrulja is best D
Why wasn t that initial pass to Ronaldo offsides Isn t he well past the last defender
deleted
good run beats his defender coming back splits two defenders and puts the ball where only his teammate can get it meanie
You re an idiot
Padding
you got downvoted because you re hiding behind taht spain flair
deleted
No Ronaldo Assist He should pass more Ronaldo Assist He should pass more Ronaldo single handedly saves the world He should pass more
Ronaldo single handedly saves the world He didn t celebrate with his teammates
deleted
Yeah he should stop saving the world all the time and concentrate on football
I mean it s either assist or no assist right So yeah not gonna be 33 each
He will never be without detractors no matter what he does When you reach the level he has reached you re gonna be under a damn microscope for everything you do I do not envy that sort of pressurePogba is killing us here
Pogba has been going off this game
If people think that was a foul just never watch football again If you can t have those battles then football is a lost cause Otamendi just got beat
Think he was trying too hard to get a foul called
Hard to say from this particular clip to be fair
LOL at Otamendi 2nd awful error against Juve
pretty garbage positioning and looked outmuscled by mandzukic of all people for much of the game
Actually outmuscling defenders and beating them physically in the air and on the ground is an area Mandzukic excels in So it shouldn t come as a surprise that he of all people gives center backs trouble in those situations
I don t see much of Mandzukic so you may be right that he punches above his weight but Ota was totally out of position and will need to do better Mandzukic is smaller than most EPL strikers
6 4 is small for a PL striker nowadays
Google says 6 2 and 185 pounds He s slightly bigger than I thought but shouldn t be outmuscling Otamendi
And Otamendi is 6 and 180 pounds
No but compared to Neymar and Messi and Suarez and Dybala and Aguero he s definitely a stronger striker of all people Strikers aren t usually known for being massive punishers
But center backs are expected to be strong Mandzukic has 5 pounds on suarez who is the same size as otamendi He just ain t that big
Centrebacks are supposed to be strong yeah Everyone s agreeing with you there The reason you re getting downvoted by people is because you used the phrase of all people which implies that Mandzukic is weak compared to other strikers Yeah he might struggle to outstrengthen a lot of center backs but compared to other strikers he ain t weak
The whole game he was getting outmuscled ref bailed him out most of the time though
I really didn t see why he gave half the fouls I cracked up when he gave that last foul against Marchisio still don t get what the ref was thinking XD
That run from Pogba
65 metres according to the french broadcast I was watching
Fuck I forgot about this game why the hell am I watching PSG
Weak defending but cracking cross
Pogba and Sandro have been playing so well recently
Otamendi one of the strongest defenders around complaining about that contact is just laughable
i ve watched every city game he s played and haven t seen anything to suggest he s one of the strongest defenders around or did you not mean physically strong
Not sure if it was a foul by Mandzukic or not but the skill by Pogba and cross by Sandro were both excellent
Could have possibly been a foul but you ve got to expect your center back to be stronger than that
Heh that s exactly what the commentators just said
Does that mean I should be getting paid for this
Can t be worse than the clowns commentating now
Anyone have Pogba s drop on De Bruyne
So happy to see super Mario score
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot to me he s been the best player of the first half Now I just wish Khedira can stay healthy and keep Sturaro off the field
Sturaro was pretty damn good today He recovered so many balls
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot He has been for a while but Allegri is attached to Evra for his consistency and alleged defensive superiority
Pogba running like a gazelle
Great cross Mandatory comment about the coefficient
I think this is the third consecutive assist for Sandro Evra s been good but this guy is just better
what a cross from Sandro
Love Sandro I wish we could have attempted to get him He s been one of the most complete young left backs for a while
Funny that he underperformed in the last season here
Yes Indeed the young man is an excellent footballer
does Pogba ever celebrate
Beautiful cross in Deserved the goal
And sadly Sandro is always on the bench
Doubt he ll be there much from now on though
He got subbed off today to his second consecutive standing ovation from our fans He s definitely making a great case for himself and there s no doubt in my mind that he ll feature quite regularly from now on
great assists 2 games in a row also very solid in defense he s fighting for it
looked quite a bit like Baba s pass to Oscar yesterday Lovely ball
That cross couldn t have been more perfect
Pogba has been amazing so far in this match hoping he scores
I love how quickly goals appear on here
Alex Sandro s cross had eyes
The defense of De Bruyne on Pogba was just horrible He put himself between the ball and the sideline instead of the ball and the door
Great cross What happened to the defender there though
Otamendi choked hard
Mogo si se bacit na glavu
Yyyyyyeeesssss Way to step up mandzukic
What a cross
Makes me miss Darke for world cup games
Vintage poacher Mandzukic
Does Otamendi think he is Ronaldo
Great cross from pogba sandrp pogba is looking good so far in this match
Pogba didn t cross it The commentator even said Alex Sandro as he crossed the ball
Ohh corrected it thanks

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsI expect Chelsea to improve marginally I have trouble seeing where the magic fairly dust that turns the clock back to last season comes from
You are what your record says you are Mahatma Ghandi
If you think I ve been unfair in mocking the Blues here s a neutral version to share with your Chelsea supporting friends https drive google com file d 0B ZcVoqtapgRNC1kT1RvbEZSYUk view usp sharing edit to add ugh does not display well in Sheets You ll have to use Excel
Hadn t planned on it but it should be easy Only problem is I don t know which supporters to pick on in other leagues p
If you beat Spurs this week I ll eat my hat Unrelated note I wear pizza as headgear
In isolation yeah catch any one of the teams ahead of you is plausible Catching all 11 of the teams in between Chelsea and 4th place well This seems beyond your grasp though I also give up p
This I agree with If the cups go toward the big fish Chelsea may well nick the EL Or if they win a cup themselves
Now that s a hot take
A lot of time and matches remain and Spurs still are a Harry Kane ACL away from a serious problem don t count your cockerels before they hatch
spits in hand offers to shake
The math nerds Ok Michael Caley and whoever does stats com put 4th on around 66 points the average is around 68 There s a lot of compression at the top since the appointed breakaway pack some subset of United City and or Arsenal has thus far refused to breakaway Plus also the computers are positively glitchy about Leicester They still have a lot of but it s Leicester in the model The models tend to weigh the previous seasons results and lessens it over time as the current season s results are factored in Frankly I don t trust the models regarding 4th place so I m inclined to agree with you If Leicester is s posed to be lower on the table that means that they points they do have have taken away from the other top clubs Gross oversimplifcation just happened So maybe we ll see a lower 4th place point total For reference the lowest in the 20 team era is 60 and the highest is 79
I ll take that bet if Chelsea do make the top 4 I ll eat a very spicy taco
I ll take a bet on either if you want
Or to put the Chelsea question in isolation What is your over under on total points for Chelsea this season
We ll see I like Everton to go on a tear I haven t watch enough Southampton to rule out a run and yeah West Ham is probably at their highwater mark If I were a betting man I d take the following clubs to finish higher than Chelsea Arsenal Man City Man United Spurs Liverpool Everton and yes Leicester Which four of those am I wrong on p And I have a newsflash Chelsea s not winning on Sunday p
It matters a lot because Chelsea is not the only candidate to make a huge run from the middlebottom of the table Everton looks good Liverpool looks good Southampton is well they may or may not come good it s hard to tell It does Chelsea no good to go on a massive run and achieve 68 points if 4th place is now 70 because someone got a hot hand 68 is not the finish line it s just a statistical point where half the 4th place team finished ahead of it kind of You are betting on Leicester falling back AND Spurs AND Everton AND Southampton AND Liverpool AND even the Hammers sure why not all dropping so many more points while Chelsea performs at last year s level suddenly and without any sort of reason to believe other than well belief I mean support your club and all but well yeah
Some other interesting things besides Chelsea p The bar gets even lower if 6th or even 7th are in the mix if the cups fall to high placed teams then the doors are open for Europa Everyone thinks Leicester will fall back to earth but I still like them for Europe Yes they have a daunting run to finish the front half but that just means they also have 13 matches reversed fixtures in their future where they glorped up 28 points on the first pass If they have another 25 28 points in them plus a few more around 7 9 from murderers row they can make 63 And if the top finishers get the cups they won t even need that many Leicester on Thursday nights What a world From West Ham to around Stoke if any of those teams go on a surge they are suddenly in play for nicking the last CL or the top EL spot It s wide open a few unexpected wins here or there Aston Villa are in deep shit DEEEEP shit They have 5 points in 13 matches 0 38 ppm They need to be more than 3 times better to get their nose into clean air I wonder what the lowest points after 13 matches that didn t get relegated was
Which is why I included the 80 target The math nerds on twitter agree that the champ this season might not make 80 whoever they are
I had that in but I dropped it maybe I should in future editions
Man City had one team to catch That team stumbled and City ran them down Chelsea has to eclipse 11 teams of 14 teams to claim fourth Sure they have almost 4 times as long to catch them as City did United but it s just too many clubs Plus they ve shown nothing on the pitch thus far that indicates there are a hair from making the switch from 1ppm to more than 2 1 ppm
I think it s sort of mad to consider it but if Chelsea can average 2 1 points per match for the rest of the way they ll have earned it no doubt
HHHHRRRGGGGAAAAHHHHH Oh sorry had a nightmare there for a second
I want Dembele with Dier maybe not as dynamic going forward although I think he s starting to get the value of passing forward p but Dembele is as smooth as butter on the ball and denying Chelsea a whiff of any takeaways up the pitch is quite valuable On Sunday I prefer Hugo Kyle Toby Jan Danny Mousa Eric Erik Christian Heung Min Harry It s not as dynamic as other options but it s stone cold hard defensively with enough up front to get the requisite 2 goals
Bah they were better than Norwich and Maccabi Tel Aviv Forgive me if Chelsea squashing bugs doesn t exactly fill me with dread When they ve played teams with some talent lately Loss to Stoke Loss to Liverpool Loss to Stoke on pens Loss to West Ham During that same span they got a win and a draw against Dinamo Kiev scoring a grand total of one goalibrahimovic substitution

CamaradonaAhh thanks Your connection helped me find this The use of grass as British slang for a police informer dates back to the 1930s and is apparently a short form of the slang term grasshopper meaning the same thing Grasshopper itself is rhyming slang for either copper i e a police officer or shopper one who shops sells information to the police
You can hover over a crest to see the team name
It s no surprise that Sandro getting more regular minutes has coincided with Mandzukic looking more dangerous He could prove to be an important striker for us this season
What does grass mean when used in this context
Omar s version including Pogba wrecking De Bruyne https streamable com 774n
Unfortunately not
Probably his best performance of the season
The people who say that are those who have only seen the Vines
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot He has been for a while but Allegri is attached to Evra for his consistency and alleged defensive superiority
That was headed for the corner flag
Oh come on put this game to bed already
Lo stile Juve
Bit selfish from Morata there He did the hard work but if he passes to Dybala there the game is over And right off the back if that Sterling nearly scores at the other end
To be fair he doesn t need to work on his attacking game too much to reach Gattuso s level
On loan though your point still stands
Yep we play it after every goal at home
It was
Sounds like it s the only game you ve ever seen
Morata nearly gifted them a goalscoring opportunity there
Come on Mandzu
Haha can t blame you for trying Barza

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsBeating Barca and Madrid was about the only noteworthy thing they did this season They ve been poor in the league too
saw today how good they can be What you mean go down by 4 goals Conceeding 3 goals in 10 minutes is much more indictative about how bad Madrid s defense is rather than how good Shakhtar is Especially considering the fact that Madrid have conceeded 10 goals in their last 3 games
That s becasue the whole league was affected by the war
Or maybe how the players are affected by the war You think it s a coincidence how many Brazilians are leaving the team They re afaird for a reason you know They had to fucking move stadiums and the club s owners are running out of cash to support the teams
I mentioned Ronaldo because the guy I was replying to talked about Ronaldo
lol Portugal and Netherlands
A win by BATE could send them through the R16 IMO Roma and Bayer have been shockingly poor this year I expected a lot better from them
I m not pinning it on anybody
Mate this is against a team in a war torn country He has dissappeared in all the big games this year Atletico Sevilla PSG Barca
lol these English commentators Sagna clearly got Dybala on the foot
Well upon future research it appears they went to Budapest instead of Bucharest and the final was in Bucharest Other than that it s true
If they re gonna rotate then why even start Ronaldo He needs the rest the most
I remember when this huge group of Athletic fans flew to Bucharest for the EL final Except that the final was in Budapest
all that means is that Bayern is a team full of chokers

Who s the outlier for United I know for Barca it s probably Messi Neymar and for Madrid it s Ronaldo but who s earning that much for United Rooney

That wasn t even a shot he was trying to settle it
I kind of wish we still had him
No you don t He has been dreadful
He just seems like a nice guy And I had hopes he could come good for us after his bad spell
We definitely do He was our only attacking midfielder that actually made runs in behind the defence and had a strikers instinst And he was an excellent finisher
The tense of this comment is bothering me more than it should
Why It s fine

thank you based wolfsburg
looks a bit like his goal against PSG happy for him

It depends where you drink Starting your night off at a Wetherspoons Look it up in central london maybe 3 4 pounds per drink The further away from central london the cheaper Start cheaper then go out I spend usually 50 60 quid per night on a good night out in London
This is true and false A lot of expensive or new tech can take 220v It s the chargers that do the converting Check with your phone and laptop to see if they can I have a LG G3 and a Macbook which with a plug converter works perfectly with the power Camera battery charger as well

What has Rabiot s mom been feeding him lately
https twitter com Ibra official status 669493486056513536
Alves has had five great months of play in the past two years terrible from 2013 to mid January 2015 then he played to a world class level going into the Copa Am rica and his defending has been bad this season Only reason why he is still at Bar a is because they couldn t sign anyone else otherwise he would have left in January
cba watching the rest of this game i literally just saw Kobe brick an open fadeaway with 4 22 left in the third quarter and then Ezeli scored an alley oop 9 seconds later
Hibbert GOAT rim protector
honestly Kobe is being forced to take so many bad shots so many bad misses but the Lakers are AIDS
i assume this guy is in uni which means it definitely will take longer than 15 minutes the problem is that in most cases you have to absorb and analyze a lot of information and when you are limited to 450 words it s difficult to be concise whilst covering all the bases recently i had a business law assignment which was worth 20 of my grade it could only be 500 words it s difficult to really cut down from 750 words to 500 without losing key aspects of your arguments
Chuck is laughing but in his head he s like wtf bruh
GSW are going to win by 60
Kobe drops at least 30 points condition he isn t injured at any time Lakers win if i m wrong i ll buy you gold for one month if i m right you buy me gold for the next three months which one of you will take me up on this once in a lifetime offer edit 6 3

Ohhhh ya beauty its Flamini
OH MAN WHAT A GOALSo much room for activities
This is so bizzare it almost looks like a sabotage I can t believe manager would set them up like this
To make a point that the BBCJK can t all play
Exactly Its either a sabotage by Benitez so Perez stops interfering with tactics or its a sabotage by the players to get Benitez sacked Otherwise there s just no way any top team uses such a bad formation Even the most casual fan would notice something is terribly wrong
Bale Benzema Cristiano James Kroos
Aye
Did you hear about their line up in the game against Sevilla CDPRNMCKIBC
I find it hard to believe he did that s one strategy for taking the midfield battle out of the game s
That is some Moyes level failure right there
Surrendering the midfield from the start Bold move Let s see how it works for them Oh right Well then
Its perfect for Barca
This hurts to look at Still baffled how we went from an organized defensive team to that Sure its against the best team in the world right now but what a poor performance and utter lack of focus and organization Hope we can do better at the camp nou
Describing Madrid s formation
I can t understand how when real is attacking in possession Ronaldo Benzema and sometimes a third player are all within a radius of 4m of each other When on top of the above there is no one between the forwards and midfield defenders lines I am surprised they can still score as many goals as they do In fact they were already doing this last year with Ancelotti and Rafa just made it worse

Hmmm who s that new Hennessey player must be a new Wels oh
You can t give creative players that much space
You cant give Stoke that much space
Exactly That wouldn t fly even in lower divisions
I didn t watch the game but this is just a snapshot isn t it I cant see that the team remained in that shape all game Surely
A team should never stand like that against a top tier team
aahh the good ol charcoal formation
Shoutout to Hennessy for the graphic
If I recall correctly in the early chapters of Tsubasa their rivals did this strat and it was effective I dont know what went wrong there
It reminds me of how we would sometimes end up looking under Moyes
poor benitez he came to italy and totally forgot how to football
Ah the classic 4 2 4 wide formation with Kroos and Modric as CBs
James such a good midfielder though right
He is He was one of the few players that were somewhat carrying real
I mean Barca were going to dominate the midfield anyway In some ways it is a good idea to not waste players by trying to compete with them in there
Because they re good you decide to give them more space
Modric Kroos James
How long will barcelona fans drag this out
About as long as that gap in your midfield
bravo just bravo
Great keeper
Had probably his best performance for Barca yet
I refuse to take anything seriously a Liverpool supporter says
Yes because the fact that he supports a lesser team than yours means his opinion doesn t matter
Bet you have lots of friends

You just didI hope we will see a worthy clash between barca and bayern at their best
i don t think bayern will ever have robben and ribery on the pitch together again but those 2 being on the pitch might not even be their best team at this point
Costa is better than Ribery anyway
No he s not This is such a stupid thing to say
Not that I necessarily agree with him but Costa has been amazing
yeah but Robbery is a nightmare to play against
R bben is better
No Robbery is better because they steal points And in hindsight 49M total for that striking power is a steal too
of course he is He has been playing just as good as prime Ribery since he got to Bayern Current Ribery wouldn t get off the bench with Costa on his current form
just as good as prime Ribery What s it like having a memory span of one year
It proves that right now Costa appears to be the more productive choice Ribery has lost a step it happens to all players eventually
Ribery has lost a step Ribery was absolutely bonkers last season And no one knows if he lost a step because of his current injury He will return soon Maybe already in 3 weeks
The point I m debating was that as of yet Costa is not better than Ribery in his prime Perhaps better than Ribery now
Ribery has never had this much impact in his career
Had 7 assists and 5 goals in the small handful of matches he actually played last season Bundesliga specifically You have to be trolling
Cool random stats
Oh god please leave
that s my point everyone was pissed that bayern were missing ribery and robben against barca now it doesn t matter
Well Robben is important they are much more dangerous with him Ribery isn t
this would be amazing
There s not much between both teams just now Barca have been excellent for a few matches but Bayern have been consistently excellent At the same time it feels like Barcelona have done their homework and ironed out their early season problems The extra motivation might give Bayern the edge too after Barcelona beat them last year
and then there s the fucking almighty augsburg
EINE INSEL MIT ZWEI BERGEN MOTHERFUCKER
Verstehe ich nicht was meinst damit
It s a popular song from an old german kids theatre from Augsburg that was very popular in the TV and it s the goal song of the FC Augsburg We also don t give a wimpel before the game but a puppet from that theatre Lovely club that one
Been to the puppenkiste museum last year after going to the christmas market Had to rewatch Urmel aus dem Eis and Bill Bo after that
I went three years ago with my little brother my then still alive grandmother and my mother Damn that was a lovely day was so close to buy a fully fledged Jim the Lokf hrer puppet for 70 And the only time I have seen a professional footballer was Bobadilla a fewe weeks later getting drunk on the christmas market Good times I miss that city so much
Every time there s a discussion about Augsburg on this subreddit or r borussiadortmund I can count on you being there Why did you leave
Why did I leave what
Augsburg You talk about it so fondly that I m curious about what led to you moving away
I finished my bachelors the masters there was not for me and most people that made that place what it was for me left So I wanted to see how much I like other places Turns out that I wasn t imagening it when I thought that those four years where the best time I will ever have And I will always remember it fondly Maybe even move back there one day who knows Augsburg shouldn T go below second league though that s a requiremend
Jim Button and Lukas the Train Conductor to be precise
Wtf were we doing
Should ve never won that game to begin with
8 different formations
Gotta keep the lads entertained and aware would be boring otherwise

So glad we play there at the end of the season
Everyone has to visit the dentist
And no one enjoys it Except for Augsburg
Well Augsburg did lose in the last minute so they might not have enjoyed it that much
The dentist was nice to them for the whole trip and then he just ripped out the tooth They were definitely in pain
We didn t enjoy the wrong penalty call But we enjoyed the match
I m with you on that Hate winning that way would ve rather taken a draw against The Parked Buss of Augsburg
Just wait until Mainz makes Bayern look like a bunch of amateurs yet again
Like they often do Fucking Mainz
I dont know much of the german league why other teams are not even close is about resources why is Bayern in a different league than the rest of the teams
Bayern right now would comfortably whoop every other league aside from La Liga They have a gulf of talent across world football not just their own league
Bayern are not all that much better than the top teams in spain england italy or psg ON THEIR DAY The thing is that bayern are so consistent comparatively They have been making far fewer mistakes than the other top teams in europe
Consistency is what seperates the best from the rest Arsenal can beat Bayern on their day and we do but we d get battered 4 times out of 6
Correct That it what i just said
And I m just pointing out why that makes them much better than the top teams in England Italy PSG
Fair enough i guess i just thought i portrayed that when i said ON THEIR DAY We agree then Consistency separates them Cheers
Yeah ressources Bayern can compete with the best because of ridiculously good marketing TV money is a joke compared to Spain or even England I would wager that Suarez Neymar and Messi make more money than all of Borussia Dortmund first eleven combined
There s not much TV money spread around the league but Bayern has done well to market to supporters globally that other teams haven t gotten close to Having an amazingly consistent success rate in recent years and having some of the most famous NT players certainly helps the appeal Bayern also has been incredible well managed and received consistent growth where other German clubs squandered their potential in the past Lastly once Bayern solidified their place in the top clubs worldwide the income was solidified as well causing further gap in the BL
Holy mother of fuck
Their home record in the CL is even more impressing
Pep likes his funky formations
And that s why I hope that if we meet Madrid or Barca in the CL before the final it will be a home game first as opposed to an away game
Why where there 24 more seats on the first 2 matches
Corporate boxes probably
Curious to see if they can keep it up when Europe s elite come visiting
Barcelona Arsenal Dortmund
When did they meet Barca this season And Arsenal and Dortmund aren t part of Europe s elite anymore
Hey now
Dortmund especially this season are better than most teams in the CL regardless it d be deluded to say otherwise
Might get far in the EL true
Oh whoops I thought I was on the post about our last 9 home CL games
Yeah Well to be honest neither is Ajax if Arsenal is not sorry I actually love Ajax
Ajax hasn t been part of the European elite for nearly 15 years now maybe longer Money talks
For me Ajax is not in European elite this season But they are usually I usually have high expectations from Ajax because I love Ajax very merry much
he s right they haven t been a mighty European side for a long time last time they got to QF of UCL is 2002 03
Yeah I know I still do not want to admit it

One team league
Zagreb 5 0 Arsenal 5 1 Olympiacos 4 0
One team league
One team group
Two team continent
Two team world
3 team universe The monstars
I think he meant that Bayern are so good that no other teams can match them But its the same circle jerk bullshit that people are taking shit about PSG and as a Celtic fan I hear it plenty too
Don t see what that has to do with his comment
one team league multiple leagues
Ok makes sense I guess I just think u vaginawishbone was trying to say that the Bundesliga is a one team league I ll let you decide if it is or not

Deutsch ist manchmal auch in Deutschland selbst eine schwere Sprache Immer weiter so
Aktuell schwer Wird sich aber auch bei mir wieder legen liegt wohl daran dass ich vor einigen Monaten selbst in Paris war und die Dinge die ich dort als sch n in Erinnerung habe jetzt einen dunklen Unterton bekommen Es ist nicht wirklich Angst im eigentlichen Sinne sondern viel mehr Wut und Trauer
Krass Find s halt brutal wie der Terror jetzt auch Deutschland erreicht Vor allem so wie du s erz hlst Ich hab mich aber auch brutalst mit dem Thema auseinander gesetzt Der Mensch f hlt sich halt zu dem was ihn ver ngstigt hingezogen Darum hab ich viel zu viel ber Paris gelesen und auch gesehen
Wie geht s euch eigentlich so nach den Paris Anschl gen und der Evakuierung in Hannover Habt ihr Angst Ehrlich gesagt w rde ich l gen wenn ich sagen w rde dass das alles bei mir nichts ausl st Versp re schon etwas Angst um da mal bei der Wahrheit zu bleiben Andererseits sollte man sich solidarisch und die Terroristen nicht gewinnen lassen aber das f llt mir aktuell schwer

Bayern or Barcelona the one with the less injuries

They sold their best players while offering new expansive contracts to average players and they built a new expansive stadium who is not profitable
Pique would have done the calma calma then the siiiiiiii celebration and then he would have spent the last minutes with his right hand opened to show the manita
CamaradonaSorry man I know you want to praise your defender but if Sterling put that on target either to Buffon s left or right that would have gone in It was a terrible miss from Sterling no defending could have saved you there

Maybe try selecting a role for him in that position that s what I do So instead of CM Playing position select CM Central Midfielder That s what I do when I want to re train my player and it seems to help
He s still at United in 2018 in my save Getting decent amount of apps but not a key player United did buy Kane in their first season so they play him instead
Getting no yellows is pretty difficult thing to do Your players will make tactical fouls and or lose their head and make rash challenges It s pretty much impossible to not get carded at least once in a game
Can I see your squad I m currently playing with Gent and I m only in 2018 so I m still struggling a bit
Get Zabaleta
HOLY SHIT BOYS THEY DID IT Belgium is proud of you
Pretty fucking stupid that two four steps are guarded
That first minute red card though
Probably Pardew
Fuck I didn t get Bolasie s skill that lost him the ball in itreally interesting read I didn t know about van Gaal breaking his leg
I love how he done it
That s somehow so very van Gaal to suddenly take up pole vaulting as a hobby
Great article Thanks for sharing
Injuries suck so much
Grear read funny to see all of the coindicences
TIL
Season cut Shaw t Fucking excellent hahaShame he wasted his career winning everything with Barcelona he could have taken us to Championship glory
He would certainly have added strength to our sub s bench
Sure he d have got into a midfield of Nicky Bailey and Kevin Thompson
He never proved himself in the Champ but neither did Kev who was always injured Bailey was alright Robson was the real guy to displace
Always had a soft spot for Tarmo Kink Should ve kept him just for advertising Parmo s
Loved Kink remember him scoring a double against Burnley shortly after we got him very decent player
I fucking love it when Estonian players get praise
The Estonian Exocet What a left foot Shame he was so incredibly hit or miss
Mate he s the Tallin Torpedo Remember one match after he scored his first screamer for the club he came on in the last few minutes literally everyone in the stands was saying he would fire one in from range What did he go and do fire one in from range
Thomson is a quality player would have done a lot if not for horrible injuries
Spent his career at a team who couldn t even dream of winning the Football League Championship Shame indeed
Heres some quotes from the article that this article is referencing Xavi is a genuine football fanatic I interview players all the time You and Jamie Carragher are the biggest football addicts I have met I met Carragher on a beach in Ibiza when we were on holiday What did you talk about Football He s a good guy a fanatic You can see that He came back to Spain to interview me I bet I could ask you about lower level teams in Spain and you d know Ibiza from the second division Ibiza are now in the third Barakaldo a tiny Basque team with a beautiful stadium They re leader of one of the four Segunda B leagues Look shows his phone I read about all the leagues every day Alaves Near the top of the second Gaizka Toquero has got five goals so far Huesca Near the bottom of the second Regional fourth division club San Andreu Mid table Started well I have friends at these clubs I follow how they do Cornella who play next to Espanyol is another I follow the Belgian second division because there are players from the Aspire Academy there What about lower level English football I follow Middlesbrough because Aitor Karanka is there Brighton are top of their league I met a boy the other day English He was wearing a Barca shirt but I asked him who he supported He said Sheffield United I know them they have 20 000 fans in the third division That s incredible You get that in England I watched some of a game with Charlton the other day There was football on television yet the stadium was packed with supporters Incredible If that was in Catalonia Olot vs Reus then there were would be a few people there and the families of the players Heres a link to the full article
Xavi s wife must be so fed up with him
well actually When I have time I d love to do the same but I think my wife would kill me Can you imagine OK you stay with the baby for three days while I go and watch Liverpool against Everton
haha he said it because he talked about Luis Enrique before he became a trainer that he used to go and watch teams and he used to wear a scarf so he was not recognized
that sounds awesome wish i had the money to travel around europe watching all the best derbies out there
Didn t he break up with his previous girlfriend and basically say well at least I can finally watch all the football I want
Xavi didn t date anyone for a while in order to be free from distraction and focus on football
Xavi and Carra seem like such an unusual combination Hopefully they both find their way into management at some point
Imagine carra trying out a bit of Spanish with a scouse accent
Me yamo carra
Sounds good to me
I ve heard it It s not so bad The real odd one was a very strong Welsh accent combined with near fluent Spanish of the Spain variety It was quite odd To be fair both were better than Chileans haha
You re basically describing what Angel Rangel is going to be like at the end of his career
Joint managers of Catalunya
El Clasico 2035 Xavi in charge of Barca vs Carragher in charge of Madrid
So knowledgeable What a guy imagine he ends up coaching Middlesborough
i m not sure my heart could take the pride
Holy shit how does he have so much time to follow all these leagues amazing Can t wait to see him training Barca some day I hope Lucho stays until Xavi arrives
What else does he have to do Footbalers are usually free most if the day after they finish training
I mean I imagine that after a long day of doing nothing but playing thinking about football and fitness you might want to do something non football related Like go mushroom hunting
It sounds like he just looks at the tables and reads articles
Yes I watch a lot of football Madrid are very strong this season They have a different philosophy to Barca They work a lot on their defence Rafa Benitez has improved that snigger
What s the Aspire Academy
Qatari football factory Foreigners go in NT players come out
That s by far the best definition for it African and Asian players training to make it into the 2022 Qatari NT
Football academy in Qatar where Xavi is studying
Best football academy in Qatar IIRC
I m Mallorquin and I didnt even know Ibiza got relegated
What a legend I miss him so much
That is such an incredible interview I wish there would be more revealing interviews like this where we get to read about player s experience in historical events and their insights towards football in general and certain players in particular
Brighton are top of their league INCORRECT Clearly Xavi knows nothing about football
they Sheffield Utd have 20 000 fans in the third division That s incredible You get that in England I watched some of a game with Charlton the other day There was football on television yet the stadium was packed with supporters Incredible If that was in Catalonia Olot vs Reus then there were would be a few people there and the families of the players How can anybody say English football has no identity
huh who said that
Vicente Del Bosque
Totally out of context He wasn t talking about the fans at all He was talking about the English way of playing football vs the Italian Spanish insert any country here s way of playing football And he s right Those times when you could recognize the nationality of a team by the way they played is over Take Arsenal and Chelsea for instance Totally opposite ways of playing yet in the same league There s no English Spanish or Italian identity in terms of playing anymore or at least that identity is getting much more vague
Take Barcelona and Atleti and you have the same disparity in play style
Absolutely yes Which is precisely my point
Pretty sure he was talking about the style teams play with when he said that
In what context
He s a cretin
What a glory hunter
Dags and Red or nuffin m8
Xavi should come help us out so those 20k fan aren t pissed because we lose 4 2 at home to fucking Shrewsbury Town Fuck
Big Nigel s doing a fantastic job
Curse of the Nigels To be fair it can t just be him We ve got a massive squad full of crap bought for a lot of money Our entire behind the scenes finance board is very opaque so no one has any idea who s actually making the final decisions on stuff I m pretty depressed seeing you lot doing so well too Football s pretty shit right now
What s happening with McGahey
Sent on loan to Tranmere God knows why our whole defence is shit might as well give him a try
What about Che Adams and Louis Reed Your squad is full of young talent sorry if I m kind of rubbing it in at the moment
Adams got injured and is finding his feet again Reed was one of the offenders last night got subbed at half time Both are really talented though Reed seems to have become a bit too relied upon for my liking though it s a fair bit of pressure for him especially when the others in midfield aren t playing well
Xavi s just trying to get in the next Sean Bean movie
LORD OF THE GRASS
Not surprised to hear him say this always thought he had his head screwed on right
He would have been dead proud of United s fans last night singing your not fit to wear the shirt 40 minutes in
The Lane s not the happiest at the moment
I can understand why you would have been promoted by now if you kept Danny Wilson
I was behind Wilson got some unnecessary stick off the fans C est la vie
Will be even more impressive next season when we re drawing 20k in the fourth division
The more I read about Xavi the more I like him He seems like such a nice guy
He is a genuine football fanatic follows third division teams all over the world I can t wait until he coaches his first team I think it s inevitable that he will become a coach
let s hope so his football brain is immense
Which is crazy to think how smart Lahm must be then Pep worked with both and made a huge point how smart Lahm was
Let s hope he successfully managed a first division team
Obviously I hope he coaches Barca one day
Mhm I m just nervous cause sometimes highly successful ex players turned managers due fairly poorly
He seems nice a good leader but from what I ve seen he also seems like a sore loser
Ferguson always scouted for the sorest of sore losers they were the ones that fought the hardest on the field
you re really determined not to find fault in Xavi lol
heh not really I m just trying to point out that for many football players their biggest asset is that they are sore losers
Except even among the realm of top class footballers Xavi is noticed as being a sore loser So it cant be that
So is Mourinho So is Ronaldo Are you saying this because of the grass length comments he d make
Not that nice a guy https www reddit com r soccer comments 3bfwxk xavi qatar has conditions for great world cup
I m just saying if someone gave me millions I too would blindly praise them for everything
yeah but you probably aren t already a multi millionair
But they can get good infrastructure due to money
Really He s said and done a lot of things recently to put me off him
really s top lad
What a football nerrrrrrd one of us
I m sure he writes for Zonal Marking under a pseudonym
Why is Xavi such a cool guy
Xavi is the ultimate hipster
Would he be impressed by this blavdes fan https twitter com Oddschanger status 669531006769213441
Xavi is a fantastic player and genuine football fanatic but I must say the whole Qatar ambassador thing is very disappointing and on the same note Barcelona s Qatar Airways deal is quite depressing as well
Have to think that Juninho and Ravenelli had something to do with that
Great Another what Xavi said post
Too much Xavi last days
Xavi to Middlesbrough confirmed
Mate he wouldn t make it into our midfield
Who needs Xavi with Big Grant bossing it
Banned for Huddersfield though isn t he I suppose we can arrange a tryout deal for this Xavi guy
Oh no you ll really struggle to beat us now s

I d go as far as say that even Arbeloa would be a better replacement for Carvajal if the latter can t play for some reason than Danilo Porto are laughing their asses of for robbing Madrid 30M

Much credit to Bale for Cristiano s goal
Guys how s Kovacic been so far in this game
Kovacic himself said he s much better as a DM than as a offensiv midfielder higher up on the field Don t really think he ll be a success in the game

Wake me up the day Cristiano do the same for BaleHe s back guys He didn t rapidly decline die or some other shit He s okay
He didn t want to score till Messi started scoring
I miss Messi its not fair if hes out injured and I keep scoring Ill just lay low for a bit until he s back
The Kneejerk is real
He was briefly less than superhuman but even that was scary enough for him to get back to form
He obviously did decline but since the last game found the fountain of youth He s getting better so must have reversed the ageing process it s the only explanation I mean that maybe a few bad games happens to everyone and just because you re over 29 doesn t mean a few bad games means the end of your career
I still think he s declining

Messi is 5 7 Cr7 is 6 1 6 inches your math checks out

That has been opta thing from the get go
They usually use words that actually have relevance to what the stat is about But motivated seems like it was just randomly chosen
Not really in the news today it was reported he d promised to work harder etc in the team meeting after the Clasico so obviously they are going with the idea that Real are extra motivated for today s game after Saturday s embarrassment
Only Benzema Ozil and Di Maria have assisted Cristiano more than Bale
OptaJose 2015 11 25 20 38 UTC 21 Gareth Bale has assisted in Cristiano s 21 goals only three players did it more times Benzema 31 zil 27 and Di Mar a 22 Duet This message was created by a bot Contact creator Source code
Reports of his demise have been greatly exaggerated
Mate this is against a team in a war torn country He has dissappeared in all the big games this year Atletico Sevilla PSG Barca
what the hell does war torn have to do with it You realize that the game today was played in Lviv a city on the complete opposite end of the country from where the conflict is taking place right Ukraine is a very big country It s not like they had to worry about bombs being dropped on the stadium It s amazing how far people go to discredit Ronaldo s achievements
Or maybe how the players are affected by the war You think it s a coincidence how many Brazilians are leaving the team They re afaird for a reason you know They had to fucking move stadiums and the club s owners are running out of cash to support the teams
It didnt affect them in the Ukrainian league they have only dropped something like 2 points since August
That s becasue the whole league was affected by the war

I think you are being ignorant and unfair towards Shakhtar They are extremely strong at home and its incredibly difficult to beat them Many big teams in last few years have been unable to do that And we saw that today how good they can be
saw today how good they can be What you mean go down by 4 goals Conceeding 3 goals in 10 minutes is much more indictative about how bad Madrid s defense is rather than how good Shakhtar is Especially considering the fact that Madrid have conceeded 10 goals in their last 3 games
Doesn t change the fact that shakhtar are good at home
so did the team don t pin it on one player
He s not pinning it on one player Ronaldo played shit in all of those games not talking about the rest of the team
Ronaldo played shit but so did Bale Kroos Ramos Benzema etc are they all fastly declining too
No because you don t usually decline as a 26 27 year old top level player Ronaldo is nearly 31 and when he plays bad he essentially isn t there
what does age have to do with it if anything it s his knee problem that has limited his dribbling compared to the past but Ronaldo didn t go from scoring 66 goals and getting 22 assists last season to becoming useless this season in the space of 3 months even when he is playing like shit he can still give chances for teammates and create space for others with his movement just because he isn t dribbling past multiple players it doesn t mean he isn t doing anything useful the only problem this season has been that he is isolated as striker and his finishing has been bad also factor that his teammates have been invisible in most big matches too
Age has a lot to do with it come on I know that Ronaldo is a crazy fit guy but sooner rather than later later his physicality will decline Also 61 goals and 21 assists Also Declining being useless ffs It means he s not playing to his standards He s been realtively worse even in his worse form than he was before
yes in 2 or 3 years he will no longer be RM quality but as of now he is definitely good enough to make a difference in any match as long as everyone around him doesn t disappear like against Sevilla and Barca I get what you re trying to say though but it came across as you calling him useless in the original comment by saying essentially isn t there
15 goals in 17 games this season while having a short run of his worst form in years Not to mention the entire team has been playing like crap and there have been an endless amount of injuries Must be tough to life up to your peoples standards
How many games has he scored in And name the teams Ronaldo plays well when the whole team plays well and sometimes he plays bad when the team aren t up to it
15 goals in 17 games is still a record 99 of players want to have at the top level
I m not pinning it on anybody
He has dissappeared in all the big games You re making it sound like his team is playing great but he s letting them down or some shit
I mentioned Ronaldo because the guy I was replying to talked about Ronaldo
they are actually in some damn good form if you actually take into consideration their form but hey fuck that
deleted
I think i understand that part doesn t change the fact that they re playing very good
the boy is growing up
Eh Wrong I think I seem to remember him getting 2 assists away at Schalke in 2014

I hope we do renew his contract Best destroyer in the world
does he even play that much
He s still a starter although he doesn t play midfield under Pep
He did yesterday I hope it becomes more routine It probably will considering Boateng Benatia and Badstuber are all healthy
It will I think a lot of the stuff the fans see Pep also sees It s why I like him He knows what needs to be done and he does it He s smart about it though He doesn t rush into things He wants to make sure that the players are all healthy before he makes moves again He moved Lahm to RB and he ll move Martinez to CDM again Martinez is regaining confidence though When he first came back he was definitely not ready to play in the midfield He looked afraid to dribble He ll get there though
Typically Bayern managers have fallen into two archetypes pragmatic and not idealistic idealistic and not pragmatic Not to say I don t appreciate them but Klinsmann and Van Gaal fell into the former while Rehhaggel Trappatoni Hitzfeld fell into the latter In his last stint Heynckes was the first manager in a long time to maintain a sense of style whilst tweaking the philosophy to achieve the best results The more you look at Heynckes career as a player and a manager the more remarkable it becomes and I ve never even been a zealous admirer of him He went from stubborn Osram to a man who adapted and changed at an old age That kind of transformation is seen rarely in anyone especially not one as decorated as him And I think Pep has really taken cues from that Yes Guardiola is highly intelligent and he wants to win more than anything But let s be real here he s always been an idealist and it s hard to imagine him ever abandoning a possession system and playing like stoke But it s year 3 and he is still constantly modifying his starting XI and tactics because a for rotation and b because he knows that the best results have not been achieved yet and he ll keep searching for the best tactic for his team I hope he signs that fucking contract or imma kill him
Well that took a dark turn at the end
How s Badstuber doing these days
He just got back from injury got subbed in against Stuttgart two weeks ago Was in the starting XI against Olympiacos yesterday and got a red card Not really a justified red card in my opinion but I m biased so you gotta decide for yourself
Just got back from injury
Didn t get to watch the second half how d he look in midfield
Couldn t really tell the match wasn t hard at all so he got to coast pretty much
He s no2 CB with Boateng And plays over Benatia
Benatia and him rotate although he s recently been starting more often over him probably due to form injury issues I guess you can say they re kinda joint starters it s just that neither of them is clear cut above the other Kinda like MaTS and Bravo at Barca except Javi and Benatia aren t exclusively alternated between the league and the cup
And Badstuber is still injured Who will move on first
Badstuber played yesterday Not the entire game though since he got a red after an hour
since he got a red after an hour I like to call that one a substitution with a handicap to even the playing field
Ya to be honest though it was a fitness problem with Badstuber He wasn t as fast as he should have been and the guy went down and he got sent off
Badstuber was never fast
it s just that neither of them is clear cut above the other I d say Martinez is easily a cut above Benatia which doesnt come as a surprise because the latter didn t have much chance to play with the team for a longer period without injuries
It s hard to say Bayern haven t had four fit CBs for more than a handful of games under Pep and its usually closer to two Between Benatia Badstuber and Martinez it s usually a safe bet that 1 2 of them are injured at any given time At the start of this season all three were actually injured and Boateng played the entire defense himself and in one game was subbed out leaving just Xabi to cover the entire back line The most you can say is that Boateng is a permanent fixture His partner or two depending on whether it s a 3 or 4 man backline varies a lot He could be paired with any of the three other CBs or even Alaba and Rafinha who sometimes play as makeshift CBs too Pep is all about that flexibility
They have to keep him he was insanely good when they won the CL Just needs to stay healthy for a while
If they could start him in the midfield that would be greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
Yeah I would so love to see a midfield of Martinez Vidal Thiago
Pep please
more like Thagio please
Bist du besoffen Deine komplette comment history schaut so aus als ob ein 14 j hriger dies alles geschrieben h tte
Der ist leider immer so
I can t even imagine the conniption Athletic fans have whenever they pop on a Bayern CL match to check in on Javi and he s chilling in his own half with Boateng
chilling in his own half with Boateng Dude have you seen our matches lately The only one chilling in our half is Neuer and even that just barely
that vocabulary tho
Is conniption not like a word people use
I mean my friends think I have a huge vocabulary and it s not something I ve ever uttered I meant it as a compliment haha Edit unless you re being sarcastic and I missed it
It s a common enough word in Ireland it means hissy fit
Also common in West Virginia Irish immigrants maybe
Chilling in the centre circle you mean CB have to stay in the other half under Pep or no chocolate
Javi was among the main reasons why we won the CL His presence in midfield was nothing short of staggering It was as if there were three of him Edit Yes please
He has to get back in midfield Simple as that
I love you Javi
Come to Arsenal please
Every thread yada yada
It s cool just throw me a downvote
You can t have all the playmakers and cdms in world gooners
not having any dms is one of the main things that s been fucking them the last few years tbf
He would be a dream signingGeorge Best top 10 goals according to some dude on youtube
in 2 his running dribbling style looks so alike to Messi P S anyone notice Mr Bean s car
The change of pace is amazing Also your flair is amazing
Thank you
Pat Jennings save at the start as well Us Northern Irelander s should have done more with those two surely
Worse teams have won more with worse players See Denmark 92 and Greece 04
Some of the tackles flying in are brutal
Goal number 10 was nuts Half of the players today would still be rolling if that had happened them
So many long balls

I feel like those first few goals would have been rated much higher had they been in color
Obligatory George Best quotes If you d given me the choice of going out and beating four men and smashing a goal in from thirty yards against Liverpool or going to bed with Miss World it would have been a difficult choice Luckily I had both I spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered I used to go missing a lot Miss Canada Miss United Kingdom Miss World In 1969 I gave up women and alcohol it was the worst 20 minutes of my life On the pizza gate incident between Manchester United and Arsenal That s what children do throw food That s not fighting We were real men We d have chinned them On having blood transfusion after a liver transplant I was in for 10 hours and had 40 pints beating my previous record by 20 minutes I used to dream about taking the ball round the keeper stopping it on the line and then getting on my hands and knees and heading it into the net When I scored against Benfica in the 1968 European Cup final I nearly did it I left the keeper for dead but then I chickened out I might have given the boss a heart attack On Eric Cantona I d give all the Champagne I ve ever drunk to be playing alongside him in a big European match at Old Trafford On Cristiano Ronaldo There have been a few players described as the new George Best over the years but this is the first time it s been a compliment to me And my favourite now They ll forget all the rubbish when I ve gone and they ll remember the football If only one person thinks I m the best player in the world that s good enough for me
And of course George Best was the greatest player in the world Pele
The Pele comparison one anyone remembers In which he would say somewhere along the lines of if he is not that beautiful then he would have achieved more than Pele
This one I think If I had been born ugly you would have never heard of Pel
Yeah look like this But I don t think this is the exact wordings
Is that Ronaldo one true He could only have seen Ronaldo in his first couple of years at United way before he looked like he d become a truly world class player
There are some videos of Ronaldo s first couple of seasons 2014 Ronaldo could be as effective as 2004 Ronaldo with 1 3 of the trickery but you never knew exactly what 2004 Ronaldo would do Edit At least once he d finished his stepovers
I had the once in a lifetime chance to play against George Best and some other UK footballers in 1976 I lived in Torrance California and played youth football since 1966 at the local parks and then in the AYSO I went to High School with Sigi Schmid and Marine Cano ex goalkeeper for TB Rowdies and in 1976 I was at El Camino College in Torrance using the weight room facilities on a Saturday morning in February I was in training for a shot at a berth in the 76 Olympics but in another sport when a friend sees me and knowing I played soccer came into the weight room and told me there was a pick up game on the football practice field and they were looking for more players I was going to decline but then he told me that Rod Stewart was there so off I headed It wasn t just Rod Stewart but also Elton John and and some other expats playing with some other English expats and a good part of the LA Aztec team Pre Season was just around the corner and everybody was trying get the poundage off But I was young and really really fit and was outrunning every body most of the English players I think that year the Aztecs has like a 20 23 man roster and 17 of them were from the UK I hadn t played any organized soccer in 3 years and just kicked around with friends over a year ago but as soon as the rust fell off and I got my feet from under me I started playing better good enough to be asked to come back as a practice player Many NASL teams had unsigned player they had practice with I has to sign some kind of waiver but in turn they paid for a medical insurance policy for me and all training players I played for about 4 5 weekends and a few weekdays before I had to leave for more specialty training in my own sport I remember after I left Terry Fisher the coach of the Aztecs asked about me When I came back from the overseas later that year I was told the Georgie had opened a bar called Besties in Hermosa Beach by the pier on Hermosa Ave When I walked in he was BEHIND the bar LOL but he even remembered me called me a gddam idjet mucker and gave me a pint George was his best customer and he would often take a stack of bar business cards walk down to the beach and pier and hand them out to every good looking bird in a bikini for a free drink and he never cared if they were legal age or not If they were pretty they deserved at least a beer NONE of these girls knew who he was but about 3 out of four a took up the offer and the bar was always filled with birds and also bird watcher who ended up buying a lot of drinks that kept the bar afloat He had an apartment on the beach about a block away George never drove especially in the US but always had someone drive home As drunk as he sometimes got he was usually at every practice on time He really loved football and a hangover was no excuse One of my most prized possessions was an old photo I had taken with me and my girlfriend with Rod Stewart Elton John and George Best I never made the Olympic Team but I did graduate from college and went on to work in Washington DC for an agency that is called now The National Geo Spatial Intelligence Agency and when I moved back to DC I found out my soon to be ex girlfriend had poached that picture along with two T shirts we got from a Battle of the Bands at Redondo Beach Veterans Park of a band we played against called Mammoth as the pimply faced lead guitarist gave to us because he thought my girlfriend was hot Mammoth may not ring a bell but I m sure the name they took later Van Halen would But even though the Tshirts and photos were lost the memories will never be and they sound even better when you talk about your Glory Days But I ll never forget George Best that g ddam idjet mucker for the rest of my days

The saying s much older than youtube
That was the banner that hung in Belfast during his funeral procession
Also it should never be forgotten that it is the tenth anniversary of the death of rallying legend Richard Burns FIFA and RBR it is for tonight
As if anyone needs an excuse for a bit of Richard Burns Rally
I m down
I had no idea You d have thought it would be everywhere here in Belfast with memorial stuff but nah nothing R I P Georgie
Yeah normally they are good at remembering things from the past over here at least we have the Airport
Hahahaha yeah
Well there s a mural of him over on Sandy Row You could call over in your hoops jersey and lay a wreath if you fancied it There was another one out East somewhere but that was painted over to be replaced by a paramilitary one which understandably kicked up a fuss
I well i know about the mural but you think you d have heard something today about it being the 10th anniversary
Im more surprised its only been 10 years Feels so long ago I think they still have a mural up the Cregagh near his childhood house
It s very strange seeing someone reddit referencing the Cregagh
It seems like weeks ago to me
I actually served him drinks in 88 while working at a club opposite Granada Studios He was making the show Best Marsh The Perfect Match and Tony Wilson brought them in for lunch
RIP George
Greatest player to come out of Ireland Most naturally gifted United player You can t teach or learn what Best could do
Isn t it funny how all the most shining eulogies in British football are reserved for players who burnt out early and became complete pissheads Best Le Tiss Gazza etc
I admit Le Tiss had his fair share of McDonalds but i ve never known of any allegation of Alcoholism on his part And maybe a bit bias but he had a pretty average length career retired at 33 due to injury Not exactly the hardest worker but putting him in that category seems a tad harsh
Judging by his Countdown appearances last month Le Tiss is doing fine and is a much smarter guy than anyone would have suspected
He was never an alcoholic but he used to get hammered most Saturday nights during his playing career I live in Southampton and every landlord club owner and taxi driver has got a story about Le Tiss on the piss
Just realized I don t know a term for drinking that rhymes with Le God
Moore Charlton Shearer Beckham BTW Le Tissier played regularly until he was 34
Also not British but from Ireland Paul McGrath can be added to that list Premier League PFA player of the year as a defender I don t think any other defender has managed that
McGrath is actually about as British as it gets He s from Ealing
I ll drink to that
It s funny because he died due to his crippling alcoholism
Yep his problem was so bad that he drank through 2 livers
from what I hear hard to stick to recovery when fans were willing to buy him drinks
In his autobiography the one published before he got his liver transplant Blessed I think it was he said that he tried some hypnotherapy style treatment which he claimed worked for several weeks for him Then when the press found out he was going to it he stopped going because he didn t want people hounding him when he went
Very similar to Paul Gascoigne
Don t die like me Reading Best s story kind of ended up helping me get something of a grip on my own crippling alcoholism Learning of his tragic decline from something mercurial and almost otherwordly to something like a useless tramp bumming around in strange leagues and causing scenes It motherfucking wants you dead or down and out and it doesn t give a shit about how fast smart or successful you are The end phases of death by alcoholism sounds so utterly demeaning disgusting and painful that the actual end sounds like a massive blessing
Fuck man Glad to hear you re doing well
And the tenth anniversary and one day since 24 hour drinking laws passed in the UK
Going on up to the spirit in the sky It s where I m gonna go when I die when I die and they lay me to rest I m gonna go on the piss with Georgie Best
Conversely the man was also an alcoholic wife beating scumbag who took multiple liver transplants that could have went to more deserving people Disgusted this city named our Airport after him too We have many more deserving people in our history Edit Kicking a ball around should not absolve a person from their sins irrespective if you support that club so downvote away Edit 2 United fans down voting as expected
yeah even Utd fans tend to ignore his later days with the club I remember watching a documentary which mentioned that in his last season with Utd he got so fed up with the team s performances that he went AWOL in the middle of the season and decided he d rather party than show up to matches Can you imagine if a famous modern footballer did that
What is Carlos Tevez
Shuck it Trebek
I ll take Football Traitors for 300 Alex
Didn t City ask allow him to take the leave though
for 6 months
Disgusted this city named our Airport after him too We have many more deserving people in our history He was a product of his times and had his demons Fair play he had a dark side but who else was any better The Eamonn Holmes city airport
CS Lewis John Stewart Bell Jocelyn Brunell Gary Moore
Wait so kicking a ball has less merit than playing a guitar
I see you opted not to pick the author or respected scientists Nice
Gary Moore
A man has never defined the Blues more aptly
Agreed I m no fan of the classic blues King Allman Clapton but there was something intense about Moore s style something unique
Equally we shouldnt forget him and denigrate his achievements because he wasnt a very nice man Alcohol addiction isnt something you can control the wife beating is obviously scummy but abusing people for being addicts seems a little harsh I didnt realise an airport was named after him I assume Belfast not Turin
Yeah Belfast
What s it with greatest footballers beating their women Messi will turn alright though i think
It s just stupid people from bad backgrounds who suddenly get the world handed to them on a platter and can t deal with it well
More acceptable back then
Correlates with substance abuse and addiction problems
If Messi started on his wife she could just put him back on his high chair
Even if Messi does get started with the whole domestic violence jag he s probably too small to do much damage no
Kicking a ball around Grow up will you There are few things more cringey than someone saying football is kicking a ball around as if it s that simple You re no better than these people on Facebook demanding that footballers swap their wages with soldiers As for Best s alcoholism and liver transplants that was his personal life This post is celebrating the footballer
You re no better than these people on Facebook demanding that footballers swap their wages with soldiers I love these its brilliant to see people trying to work out the economics of it and realising how fucking stupid it is
One brings joy and entertainment to the masses The other invades foreign nations on the whim of politicians FWIW I m not having a go at soldiers We all need to make a living but we can all stretch the logic to suit our arguments
It s fucking bullshit Its like my mother or my wife when united lose a big match It s just a game For better or worse people invest a huge part of themselves to this game Look at the faces of the fans when their team scores a an important goal What else brings that much extreme mixture of positive emotions fleeting as it might be Very fucking little
It s just a game must be the stupidest quote ever To them it may just be a game but the fans it means everything people often say men show no emotion but you look in the crowd after a team has been relegated won a cup and you ll see many emotions including grown men in tears
It s the same with any Maradona post But he beat his wife but but he s a cocaine addict but he he cheated by using drugs
With a friend currently on the transplant list who has barely drank a pint in his life fuck this guy not only do people like him take organs that other people deserve more high profile cases like his actually discourages people from signing up to be a donor
high profile cases like his actually discourages people from signing up to be a donor Is that true I just can t imagine people refusing to be donors because of cases of famous people being privileged
I d be amazed if this is the case
Not what I meant in the slightest an alcoholic who is famous meaning people who might have previously signed up to be an organ donor wouldn t do so one of the main reasons people use to not sign up is because they feel that there organs would go to alcoholics and drug addicts
Some might say alcoholics and drug addicts are victims of horrible crippling illnesses too
Seen children who had no choice in the slightest become ill and rely on donations to live hard to feel sympathy for somebody who bragged about the champagne lifestyle he had and caused other people to be discouraged from signing up to be donors because they don t want there organs going to alcoholics and drug addicts For what it s worth I think there is a vast difference between someone who homeless or has suffered abuse and has turned to substance than a rich and famous footballer
So a rich and famous footballer deserves no sympathy for being blighted by a horrible condition I m not one to pick and choose who I feel bad for The man died from this He s not sitting in some mansion somewhere lording it over his stockpile of livers And I agree he s no more deserving of a liver than someone else Perhaps less so because his illness wasn t just something that could be fixed with a new liver But if you were dying and were offered a liver would you really turn it down for someone more deserving You re a bigger man than me if you would
Hang on are you saying he should have turned it down Blame the system dont blame the guy for taking something available to him that could save his life
He got himself into that situation by drinking to excess and bragging about it whenever he could
I can t believe people are circlejerking his LOL I DRANK ALL DAH ALCHAHOL quotes from him after he had one of his fifty six liver transplants It s fucking pathetic Sure he s a good footballer but he sounds like he was an absolute tosspot
Whats worse was the actual real life circle jerk People in Belfast knew he was an alcoholic it was literally killing him yet they where busting their asses to buy the man a pint just so they could say they drunk with their hero Pathetic
Pretty much exactly the same happened with Alex Higgins Probably Gazza too
You can t fault them They re Irish
Yeah if he was Australian we d probably just take a photo with him outside the local prison
That was nice
They d probably classify themselves as either Irish or more than likely Northern Irish
The man was a first class prick I m glad his hedonistic lifestyle ended as it did but the repercussions can be felt on his family
ITT folk who ve been lucky enough never to have had to deal with addiction in their lives Talk is cheap lads
I think it s where you see the average age of the subreddit coming out Haven t had to deal with their own shit or haven t lost anybody to anything like alcoholism or drug addiction Ill people aren t arseholes they re ill
Bunch of absolute cunts Seemingly think that alcoholism is just loving the drink no self control Best was just a party animal Its being dependent on alcohol every second of every day And if one more person equates him going through two livers to stopping two people having transplants I ll swing for them The first liver was his fucking own he wasnt giving that away
I ll swing for them https pbs twimg com media CHFE EvWwAA2rpH jpg
Yeah addiction is a problem and it s hard to stop doing something you re addicted to But when you burn through 2 livers because you can t stop you re taking chances away from other people People who might ve lived a longer and more decent life Talk is cheap mate Just because he was good on the pitch doesn t mean he should be worshipped off it
One of the livers was his own tbf What is your solution Let him die Its not like it was a conscious decision to kill himself after the transplant he was an addict
I don t know if I have a solution But he shouldn t have been bragging about slugging pints while on medicine
If I had to choose between dribbling past 5 players and scoring from 40 yards at Anfield or shagging Miss World it d be a hard choice Thankfully I ve done both George Best
Proper legend
Dumb cunt didn t deserve liver transplants he got Because of him many people who actually deserved 2nd chances didn t get them
Helmet
He s right though
Alcohol addiction doesn t make him a dumb cunt though
Alcoholism is the only disease you can get yelled at for having
Just an Asshole
He s a prick for other reasons but being unable to control his alcoholism isn t one of them
Its like they think that people make conscious decisions to become addicts
Yeah don t think Besty really thought oh I ve just gone through a whole load of pain and been bedridden for months while slowly bringing myself closer and closer to death but I might just do it all over again just for a laugh Could be another one of those stories people tell about my banter
Not for alcoholism For the multiple liver transplant which could be used by other non scum people
And the liver transplants were brought on by his inability to control his addiction Not sure what point you re making
The point is that people who consistently relapse into alcohol abuse shouldn t receive transplants over other patients and should be pushed down lower in the waiting lists
No shit Poirot My point is that doesn t make Best an asshole He didn t relapse on purpose
To be even considered for a liver transplant a patient has to be fully responsible to keep it healthy It is pretty much like 2nd chance When they screen for possible candidates that is an extremely important category without it people don t get livers He got them because of his status and pissed it away An addict got a healthy liver over someone who actually was sick
Hmm I m starting to think he might have had some kind of addiction to the alcohol Almost as if he had no control of his drinking We should probably tell the authorites For now let s just call it alcoholism until they come up with a better name for it
He got them because of his status and pissed it away And died People are acting like Best got away with one His addictions killed him We should be pitiying him not abusing him Its these attitudes and misunderstandings of addiction that mean we dont treat them properly
So if he got the liver because of who he was and not because he was considered responsible enough to be sensible with alcohol post transplant why does that make him an asshole Surely it d be the people who made the decision My point doesn t change if that s the argument
If you re drinking is so bad that you need many livers it s probably time to go Also being in addiction doesn t desolve you from criticism There s nothing wrong with drinking and driving then it s just addiction
Haha what an incredible leap
Well 2 people didn t get second chances not sure how he d have stopped many people lol

Horrible analogy Proper analogy would be like if someone is fat because he has horrible eating habits and gets a heart replacement over someone who actually had a genetic heart condition and needed a heart Then proceeds to ruin his healthy heart by eating shitty food while a person with a heart condition dies from the wait
Rest in Peace Best but he wasted two Liver
My uncle Harry was his minder for a few years Says one morning they woke up in Glasgow had a match at Old Trafford that day Made it back to Manchester in time for the second half Scored a hat trick
Can t believe it s been 10 years I remember watching the funeral and looking over at my Dad as silent tears rolled down his face
oh
This thread should be a quote fest
14 min compilation https www youtube com watch v 2FhhhT27KM0
Nice there was some clips I had never seen before
Yeah it s a good compilation I reckon I even like the music I remembered this clip after searching for some clips of him a while back to see how great he was and this clip thoroughly convinced me
10 years already I remember watching his funeral on the TV Shame he practically retired at 25 due to drinking and partying
If only he had a tiny bit of professionalism he could have gone on to be a Man Utd legend like Wayne Rooney
The famously professional Wayne Rooney Would you say the same about Tony Adams
If Tony Adams had missed training to go and get pissed or if he retired because he didn t get his own way and threw a hissy fit about leaving the club then yes Just so happens he didn t do any of that but that arrogant cunt Best did
Must have missed a fair bit of training when he was in jail for two months having been convicted of drunk driving Alcoholism is a disease why does Adams get a pass where Best does not
Because Adams as a former Arsenal player is infallible apparently
Adams as a former Arsenal player didn t ruin two livers through being a pisshead cunt and didn t run away from training numerous times to aid that It s a case of someone who turned their life around and one nasty bastard who refused to
He did however drive drunk and admitted to playing games for Arsenal while pissed So he was a danger to others and put his career at risk Its a case of someone who turned their life around and someone who couldnt Do you think all addicts are just selfish
George Best drunk himself through multiple livers and into his deathbed Tony Adams beat his addiction and set up the sporting chance clinic to help fellow athletes beat their addictions
Continuing to drink after his liver transplant was stupid but it cost him his life Do you think he was doing it for a laugh because he just loved a party Alcoholism is a disease Adams should be lauded for beating it but Best shouldnt be abused for succumbing To criticise Best for allowing his alcoholism to affect his career and not Adams who missed months of a season and even played drunk is hypocritical
Stay classy buddy
Stay classy buddy How is he not being classy What the fuck does classy even mean in this sense You spoke ill of a footballer I like ergo you are not classy Typical vote pandering neckbeard babble
Maybe criticising someone in a thread about the anniversary of their death isn t a terribly nice thing to do
It s 100 serious I don t understand why Man Utd fans fall over themselves to laud Best who never wanted to play for them and missed training all the time to go get pissed yet slander a club legend like Rooney if he goes a couple of games without scoring
who never wanted to play for them You re speaking out of your arse Also no one s slandering Rooney He s their second highest goal scorer From what I can tell they merely want him benched
He has a point though Play to your best your entire career win countless accolades retire late on like Rooney and Lampard and you will be hated mercilessly mocked and ridiculed Burn out retire early and drink yourself half to death and the nation will love you for it We have a weird self loathing complex in English football where we hate the successful but eulogise the people who wasted their careers and talent
Yeah Lineker Shilton Shearer Beckham Scholes Neville etc are all hated Lets not pretend Rooney doesnt get a lot of warranted stick He s unprofessional he spends his summers drinking and smoking and he s twice threatened to walk out on United in order to get himself a bigger pay packet He s also not performed for England at a tournament in 10 years including letting us down badly in 2006 He s clearly been a fantastic player but that doesnt mean we have to love him

Kovacic himself said he s much better as a DM than as a offensiv midfielder higher up on the field Don t really think he ll be a success in the game

They sold their best players while offering new expansive contracts to average players and they built a new expansive stadium who is not profitable
Pique would have done the calma calma then the siiiiiiii celebration and then he would have spent the last minutes with his right hand opened to show the manita
CamaradonaEverything is back to normal in r soccer now
Setanta commentator they ve been well almost perfect while Messi s been away And now they re em they re just perfect
Still no Pogba screamers
Not enough degaard updates either
And Diego Costa antics shaming
He just got someone sent off I don t think it will be long
Well there it is
Chelsea are winning games now though
It s truly miraculous how game in this situation is plural
Tis a Christmas miracle
Was Messi actually injured Jesus
Took time off to gather more Ki
Yeah he ran out of sensu beans earlier
He gave them to Suarez and Neymar actually He didn t need them
He s been doing intense meditation sessions with the Elder Kai and is now Mystic Messi
Spent a couple of episodes charging up his spirit bomb
Just took time off to become Super Messi God Super Messi
more Ki Seung yueng
He s going to for a Spirit bomb isn t he
Those three are just insane Mezmerizing
Messimerizing
Yeah something like that D
Messimaruazing
Messuaneymarising
That s actually one of the best team goals I ve ever seen
How do you even defend that Three players just absolutely tearing through the whole team
foul
lucas would have brought somebody down
Except he would have already been on a yellow and would have had to let him go
Classic
two fouls
People can t just go flying through the air like that Jackie
You don t That s when you shake your head and say Too good
You just can t They re doing this against Roma but they could do it to any side
They can only do it when the opposing team doesn t defend properly If they do track the runners you can stop moves like that Problem is they do it to you all game and eventually you have a lapse in concentration and they do this to you
Just takes one player s lapse in concentration for that breakdown The fact that Barca does this so frequently is what s scary
was thinking that I suppose the backline has to push up with impeccable timing but with passing that quick it s not gonna happen In fairness to Roma they look like they were trying not to sit too deep but that frontline is just too good
Foul hard enough to sit someone down on the build up
At the start of the clip Keita is man marking him After Messi lays the ball of he follows it when he didn t need to If he stays with him he can block his run Even after Keita lost him it was still stoppable When Messi lays the ball of the second time Maicon doesn t react to his run If he reacted earlier he would have easily dealt with the ball It s great play by Barca and they caused the mistakes but the goal was avoidable from Roma s perspective
If Keita had stayed with Messi then Neymar would ve passed to Suarez instead From there Suarez would have the ball with plenty of space Neymar and Messi to look up to and maybe even made a similar sort of run himself there s just endless possibilities so score when you ve got a team playing as good as Barca have been playing
track the runners instead of chasing the ball The RCB has didn t track the run of messi leading to the goal
The RB and CB tried he was just too quick for them
Football porn
It s reminiscent of Arsenal s goal vs Norwich Aka this one https www youtube com watch v wz EaTwqNII
Why the fuck did someone feel the need to play Coldplay over this
Apparently either Norwich or Arsenal used to rule the world
Just not as good as Arsenal s I might be biased
Biased but correct tbqh
staight from the most biased source of them all thanks
Nah that Norwich goal was beautiful
No definitely not as good but similar for sure
God I love soccer
That was better than porn imo
You can t just pay a young lady with big tits to deliver goals like this in the champions league
That s what you think
Maybe we should try
We do have the technology now
Like something straight out of a video game
I wish I could do that in Fifa
And that finish Pure art
Seriously how the fuck do you stop that Unreal
chop him down
MSN is finally back
You know what s unfair this is not even surprising anymore Those three are an exhibition
Seriously Watched this goal and was like oh wow that was nice but was upset that the ball was played over the top to Messi instead of a backheel I just want the buildup to go on forever because I know once he s through its over
Good guy Alves
Didn t pull a Nani
That still irritates me
Some say it still keeps Ronaldo up at night
That explains why he keeps moving further and further away from Ronaldo
That will always irritate me Nani ruined what would have been the greatest goal of Ronaldo s life Ronaldo beats both the greatest defender in the world at the time Pique then the greatest keeper of all time Casillas against who was the greatest team in the world at the time Spain All those things together and Nani invalidates the goal with his greed Infuriating To this day I think it was the greatest piece of football I ve ever seen of course enhanced by the fact that he beat both Pique and Casilllas I don t care how impressive a clip is if it s in the Ukranian league EDIT To everybody telling me Nani was onside I don t know if it was true I still see a lot of debate till today Ronaldo still argues that Nani was onside Here is the best screenshot I could get from a low fps clip you be the decider https gyazo com 6c13739c5292aab0594f73b8c685092f Ronaldo always seemed to be a good sport about it but onside or offside that ball was going over the line and I don t see why Nani couldn t shy away like Alves did to give his teammate his deserved goal
But it was a friendly Ronaldo should have done that in the weeks before when he was playing spain in the world cup
Does anybody have a clip of this
https youtu be j5gDJfFvObg
idk soccer what happened
The ball would have gone in the net and been a goal for Ronaldo but because Nani headed the ball in while being offsides there was no goal Edit got called offsides
We followed the guy Ronaldo completly outplay the defense of the opposing team and scoring a goal or so he thought At the last moment one of his teammates hits the ball but he s so far up he s off side thus cancelling the goal Ronaldo gets mad rightfully so i d say
Here you go
Nani was onside though no 3 I think Pique plays him on with his legs because he s lying down and even so Nani touched it after it passed the line
STUPID NANI CANCEL CRISTIANO RONALDO AMAZING GOAL NEW 2015
GONE SEXUAL
he was behind messi when he shot he ball he actually impeded the defenders clearance by being in front of him Woulda been called offside had he actually been offside
He is in ultra teamplayer mode today
Isn t he always
He is he rather passes the ball than score himself
Great restraint and he held off that last defender
Hahah it s just really bad defending right guys They can t really be that good Right Guys sobs

The passing the movement the Messi Perfection on a football pitch
Some fine Messi ing by Barcelona so far tonight
This is some performance Suicidally naive high press by Roma but Barcelona s passing and pressure is just beautiful Nigh unplayable
We ve made Messi a verb Pack it up boys

Alves being a bro
DAMN 5 0 now this is absolutely the best Barcelona squad
MSN is back
aside from the possible risk of epilepsy good gif
You re looking for the word seizure Epilepsy is a disorder that usually includes symptoms like seizures
Thanks that is the word
Oh my
I regret nothing
He s Back
Let s face it at this moment Barca is just at a totally different level The set up of that goal is crazy and the finish Well its a Messi finish what else can be said
The assist for the goal was totally flithy I think that was from Suarez Such a deft touch
What a goal These guys are playing at an insane level nowadays
Holy shit
tiki taka level MSN
reminds me of Austrias team goal vs Liechtenstein this year http gfycat com GoodnaturedDistinctItalianbrownbear

Incredible goal my god
That was insanely good
Oh my what the fuck MSN That was honestly magical
Falque thought about appealing for offside for a second before deciding fuck it
Shit is not even fair jesus
Suarez can do anything
You know at this point you should really just foul them Maicon grab his shirt and pull him the fuck down So you ll get a yellow big deal But I guess it doesn t matter in the end because they gonna score some more anyway
He s baaaack
I love how people used to worry about how selfish Suarez and Neymar would play with Messi on the same pitch Jumped off my couch for this one

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsIs a player considered a one club man if he was loaned out early in his career
If Andros Townsend spends the rest of his career at tottenham it would be funny if he gets considered as a one club man after like 10 loans
No need to exaggerate only 9 loans
Yes Lahm was loaned to Stuttgart back in his early days if I recall correctly and he s still considered a one club man i m sure there are other examples it s just that I can t think of anyone else from the top of my head
John Terry also was loaned out but noone would really argue he isn t a one club man eitherGood man Had a season ticket at Cracovia when I studied out there Some season we re having Great to see Kapustka doing so well too

Leeds have more points than that
There s a club on Elland Road just off Lowfields Road who could do with some new players at the moment Owner is a bit of a knob mind Could probably get a game
Just a normal Leeds fan he was active on a Leeds message board once upon a time Tackle was clean and just done for a laugh that s how Vinnie was

Can someone tell me exactly what these things are I need to accept I can t grow a beard I m also guessing you wouldn t recommend buying a cheap razor from eBay
Don t give a fuck about off the line clearances ten men etc It s an away win And with how we ve been playing I ll take it
Silvestri terrible for the goal which is a shame as his handling looked markedly better today Berardi positive on the ball but some mistakes such as passing Bamba erratic Cooper meh Taylor handled his winger well and got in behind once Dallas meh Adeyemi woeful Murphy positive on the ball dwelled a bit at times though Cook far too good for this team Wood did he win a header Antenucci hard worker always looks like he ll make something happen We need something different hopefully Botaka is it
I m just not sure why it takes us so bloody long to get going Dallas is great but only in the second half I d start Antenucci on the right over Byram He might say he doesn t want to but I don t think a player should dictate his terms to the manager He s a right footed player who is clearly comfortable cutting inside and shifting it onto his left He can definitely do a job there I d also like to see Murphy start over Mowatt

Yes this is the area final Should have clarified that This is Fratton Park home stadium of Portsmouth
I won after penalties Every penalty went in until I finally saved their 8th shot And sorry for this stupid small screen GIF My first time recording my screen on PC and I didn t put FIFA in fullscreen because I didn t think it would like this if I didn t Ninja EDIT I m Portsmouth btw and was playing against Crawley Town against Legendary
No you could hear three explosions in the first half very loud in the stadium and broadcastExcept we can t beat Spurs Like ever
Neither can Swansea
yeah well
Zac would be a Swansea fan
because he s pretty but struggling of late
Same back at you With love not really Man Utd
I got your back bro
This year only one team has beaten Spurs Even United needed an OG to do it
Yep Here s a list of scorers of winning goals against Spurs in the prem this season Kyle Walker
Always rated him
Wenger did in fact almost sign him
United didn t beat Spurs Kyle Walker did
If Walker had not scored Rooney would have
Rooney looked like he had a bad case of buck fever in that instance Much like Kane did last Sunday
It s less fun when you think of it that way
To be fair the only reason Walker ended up scoring is because Rooney bottled it
Man of the match he was I was hoping he would hit top form that game too haha
And everyone can beat Villa
Almost everyone
sadly
I mean we ve beaten everyone else since our return Both us and Tottenham have had a mix of managers And yet no matter what we seem to do we just can t beat them I m not hopeful the December match this year either
We ll probably go 2 0 up but end as a draw
Maybe though you re apparently more confident in our team s ability to go 2 up against any team right now
I always get super nervous against Southampton since you guys are usually tearing it up at the time but for whatever reason we seem to pull the win or tie out of no where at times Usually great games though well at least in my biased opinion haha
I think two or three times in the last couple of season we ve been 2 0 up against you guys at half time then Christian Eriksen just decides to tear us apart in the second half and you guys win 3 2
Or that one season of Adebeyor going nuts in his first game back under Sherwood Basically his only bit of form in years and it gets him two goals against us
It was nice feeling the way Spurs might have felt when Elia went nuts and scored two away against Newcastle last season
Yeah fuck Newcastle and that Krul game
Yeah just go God mode for one game and all is well We d been on a good run against Newcastle at that point too
I think we seem to beat you and Swansea a lot as your good footballing sides like we are but also not quite as good as us So you don t sit deep you actually have a go at us That weird thing where you tend to struggle more against as worse side who are just happy to take a draw It s like how united used to just always beat us
This season it is definitely you doing the tearing up
tie Spotted the American
spoiler alert there s more than one
Wait non English people watch footy as well
Haha true I hadn t even noticed I actually usually do say draw interestingly enough

And we can t beat fucking Norwich such is life
Newcastle Norwich was 6 2 sorry to be that guy
FUCK
Sorry Love your work though
I preferred his earlier stuff it s too commercial now
Did you actually make this Saw it earlier on today on another site
These things get made around this time every year Someone else could ve made one as well
Well at least I didn t have to be that guy
That game broke my heart
That game partially mended mine only for it to be repeatedly shattered afterwards
Business as usual as a Newcastle supporter then
Should say where anybody can beat Chelsea
except Arsenal
And us
In fairness we can t beat anyone
Bournemouth
Oh do fuck off
Fuck injuries
After 13 games I m starting to think the only word to describe us is that we re Fucked
Chin up Tamworth is only 9 points from the top
You think you re special We lose every week
Looking forward to this weekend but will be sitting in the home end as the away end sold out
Actually says Where nobody can beat Leicester Except Arsenal
Not saying we would ve won but to be fair Mike Dean fucked us over e Lol no idea why I m in the negative now Hell I don t get r soccer sometimes the officiating that match was dreadful and even Chelsea fans can admit that
You guys always say that
Every team s fanbase blames the refs on a regular basis hardly an Arsenal exclusive phenomenon Did you even watch that match It was a very unusual case
I was joking I forgot how sensitive it gets in here sometimes I remember Mike Dean fucking over many teams to be fair I didn t catch that specific match but did see the outrage afterwards My cousin supports arsenal and after every loss he blames the ref no matter what It s quite funny
Your cousin must have hated you for joining Manchester United
Nah its all good he got him an Xbox
Yeah well

They started out absolutely abysmally Chelsea esque but have recently been kicking things up and are in the 6 spot after beating Milan last Saturday
Leicester have still only lost once and they went into the lead in that game mad
The best team they didn t lose to was Tottenham and they drew them The best team they ve beaten is West Ham 2 1 The next month will be telling for this team
Pretty good considering our defence let in 14 goals in the first 7 games Thank god for the rest of the team making us score
Like Liverpool 2013 14
But Leicester Could win the league
In fairness them being in the league doesn t add much as they where behind in a load of games Spurs have also only lost once
What about when not being fair
For La Liga 12 games played Sporting beat Malaga beat Deportivo beat Rayo beat Palmas beat Sociedad beat Sevilla beat Getafe beat Levante beat Villarreal beat Atletico beat Eibar beat Granada beat Bilbao beat Valencia beat Celta beat Barca beat Real beat Espanyol beat Betis beat Sporting There is nothing special about this specific cycle there are 3657 such cycles for La Liga Havent written code for EPL You can find the code here http pastebin com QdRvfwRv You will need to modify the arrays if you want it to work for the different leagues EDIT Coded it for EPL There are 144 such chains for EPL A different example for EPL Bournemouth beat West Ham beat Newcastle beat Norwich beat Swansea beat United beat Tottenham beat Sunderland beat Crystal Palace beat Liverpool beat City beat Everton beat West Brom beat Arsenal beat Leicester beat Watford beat Stoke beat Southampton beat Chelsea beat Aston Villa beat Bournemouth
without a circly picture I won t believe you
The circlier the truthier
Which is to say if anyone can beat anyone La Liga is more competitive
Yeah this means nothing Example circles for La Liga Serie A
Without pictured badges and fancy slogan I won t believe you
Damnit man I m a software engineer not a graphic designer
Not with that attitude
And now do Bundesli oh well Bayern
The Internet being the Internet
Graphviz
graphviz is where it s at
Damn right it is I don t usually get to see my computer science and football worlds intersect so neatly
La Liga Where anybody can beat anybody
The irony that this is more true for La Liga when this infographic was meant to defend the EPL s recent poor form in Europe is pretty funny
And in all 144 Leicester will be next to Arsenal and Spurs will be next to ManU
For what it s worth here s the version with the corrected scores http imgur com JzpajZe Edit Correcterer scores
Did you use an algorithm to find this path or was your work manual Edit I was bored so I spent a little bit of time writing a Java app to brute force it Here s all the combinations of which 144 exist at the moment They all start on Stoke but being circular you d get the same results ultimately no matter where you started Edit 2 OP s combination is on line 43 Edit 3 Tried to do the same for Bundesliga And well Can t because Bayern
Shouldn t be too hard to do manually it s quite closely defined by the fact that Villa and Bournemouth have only won one game each and Tottenham and Leicester have only lost one After that there aren t too many decisions to make
not to mention a better render of our logo good good good
lol logo
ELI5
the answer we were looking for was badge or crest
We all know what he meant but it s badge
Is it still a badge if there is no shield
Get ready for the Sport bible to steal this without credit
I remember this was the case during the 13 14 season as well and it turned into a very good season entertainment wise so hopefully it s the same here
It feels like this one has already started to top 13 14
It s shaping up quite similar 4 5 teams at the top of the table with only a couple of points separating them the champions faltering badly and a team at the bottom who everyone has nailed down as relegated but a new manager could bring some hope
Hope What s this magical hope you re talking of
He was talking about Chelsea
I don t know I m being nice to Villa it must be this damn Christmas spirit of mine
I hope some of our opposition have some Christmas spirit and gift us three points soon I m looking at you Watford
I hope Scrooge takes away your points for Christmas
You need a heart transplant for being nice to the Seals and a brain transplant for thinking they have a hope
Yeah but I don t think Chelsea will fire Mourinho
Obviously I m a biased Liverpool fan but 13 14 was ridiculous Suarez had one of the best years that I ve ever seen from any footballer Yaya Toure was at his peak devastating bullying best Mourinho blew his chances of winning the league in his first year back at Chelsea with conservative tactics Tactics Tim had that beautiful gilet and weird salute thing with Adebayor Fulham hired a crazy guy and Moyes ruined Man U Crazy season This season is good so far though even if Liverpool have been mostly bad
We got Klopp that s the best part of this season
13 14 a good season depends on the perspective I guess
We only lost 2 0 to City not 3
Oh man seems I have a real problem reading and copying Apologies
It feels good that we only fit in this because of a very unfortunate own goal
we only lost 3 1 to Southampton
Ugh I had the results written out right in front of me as I made it and I still ballsed it up Apologies
Literally a cicrlejerk
This graphic for new r soccer logo
BPL is the most entertaining league Great density at the top great international players and teams with lots of tradition still being at the top Downsides are the atmosphere in the stadium and the lack of homegrown talent EDIT for some reason I like Stoke
In reference to your latter point lack of homegrown talent that s one of the reasons it s been so exciting to follow Spurs lately It s a shame that it does seem so rare but hopefully with investment in academies we ll see such things become more common
convert him Convert Him CONVERT HIM RUMMENIGGER THE SPURS SUPPORTER
Sod off We don t have many foreign supporters we need all the ones we ve got
Give the paperwork on that Messi transfer some time and you ll be good
Well not too much time otherwise our fax machine might start having problems
Go Stoke
Everyone s a Stoke fan when they want to downplay Messi or Barcelona
I ll fight you for him
I was really sad that I didn t name myself Rummenigga
it s ok we got u
Uhhh autocomplete
All of ours are injured
EDIT for some reason I like Stoke Top lad Most of the atmospheres are decent really its the top teams with their day trippers who struggle
EDIT for some reason I like Stoke All the right reasons
For some reason continentals think when we say it s the best league it means the highest quality teams when it s only because it s the most exciting even if the quality isn t as high
It might still be if you account for the entire table
Atmospheres at the big clubs maybe
Just wait till next year and your move into a bowl stadium
That s when we become a big club you heard it here first domalino
Atmosphere at West Ham has been slowly dying for years Doubt there will ever be a game like the Ipswich play offs again which is kind of sad
I was at the home leg of the Ipswich game and I have a season ticket this year and I disagree Think that s an odd game to pick because there have been better games since beating Chelsea a few weeks ago was about as good as any game I ve been to Even Everton in the cup last year with less than 30 000 fans there Every Tottenham game
Ya the top teams have superstars are fun to watch and are prone to playing like shit every third or 4th week so the other sides aren t completely out of it
Stoke
wouldn t you be able to do this in any league with no undefeated teams
Not necessarily no If you have teams that have only beaten the same teams for example it gets tricky Also only 13 games in to a season is quite early however in that crazy 13 14 season it only took 10 games
Oh ok thanks for clarifying that up
No worries Also it was made trickier by the fact Leicester have only lost one Tottenham have only lost one and Aston Villa have only won one so their positions were fixed in the circle next to Arsenal Man U and Bournemouth respectively
Not necessarily because it s possible a league has two teams who have only lost once each but both to the same team You wouldn t be able to do a circle if that were the case
Where everybody is kinda not really good and everyone will watch the UCL semis from their comfy couch
The whole anybody can beat anybody thing is true of every league in the world and I still don t understand why people only ever say it about the Premier League like they re unique or something Even in supposed one two horse race leagues like La Liga the juggernaut teams almost always lose a couple of games a season to teams they shouldn t be losing to
Because big teams lose to small teams very often that hardly happens in la liga and especially the bundesliga Although it does happen from time to time it s just a lot more uncommon Plus imagine barca bayern or madrid in the position chelsea is in right now Quite literally impossible But not saying the competitiveness of the league is the sole reason for the bad form but it does contribute
Plus imagine barca bayern or madrid in the position chelsea is in right now Quite literally impossible on the other hand could you imagine Chelsea or city or united sinking into mediocrity like AC Milan did in serie A
You mean like we did 5 6 years ago Doesn t happen often I grant you but it still happens
Something like Chelsea is literally happening for the first time in the Prem it s a bit silly to infer anything from it It s exceptional Well except for Dortmund last season I guess
How fast are people forgetting United under Moyes
Moyes United wasn t nearly as bad as Chelsea were in their first 12 or so games this season
No but other aspects of their respective declines are similar
That s because the big teams in Bayern Madrid and Barca are better and more consistent than the teams fighting for the title in the EPL
True u Al Gala needs to give us an infographic of upset frequency to really measure the stratification of the top leagues
Marketing
I feel like The Circle of Life should be playing in the background There s even a lion with a crown on its head
I got you https youtu be VxTQKxyJyxw
Fuckin hell norwich scored 2 goals against newcastle amazing up front Just the back was the problem
I remember that one time Villa won a match What a day
Any particular reason why you made the scores on the bottom half as if they were away wins I am not moaning about it just found it very confusing
I tried to make it so the team s score was closest to their logo I m graphically challenged though and didn t know how best to put it on the thing
Here is the one from 13 14 season http i imgur com oGtMJF2 jpg I personally find that way easier I could not imagine any kind of layout with scorelines in there either tough task
Yeah I did that one too tried to step it up with scores this time haha
Ah I was wondering since you mentioned that in your other comment here Really challenging design with the scorelines I will see if I can come up with something as well
I actually hadn t seen it as Elinaeri did although of course that is the standard football naming convention Scores closest to the logo made sense to me
Maybe as a cyclical human centipede
Can someone make one of these for the 03 04 season
Look at how much we suck look at our top teams failing week in week out That must mean the league is more competitive s
Football Feed on facebook have nicked your post
Well technically it s after 106 games played
I m glad we could do our part with our one win against Bournemouth
I ll believe that when we beat Palace
A Condorcet circle The cool thing about Condorcet circles is that you can delete all of the results from all of the matches involved in the circle and get the same rankings The thing is though that this is probably not the only Condorcet circle in the EPL this season
I am not sure but I don t think this holds true if the teams are separated by goal difference
Right only zero sum results Disregard the scores
https twitter com SoccerAM status 669613679013400576 Looks like SoccerAM have reposted this without giving credit
Where anybody can beat anybody Except Villa Villa can only beat Bournemouth
this is really cool
Awfully kind of Villa to only win one game this year to give our content creators somewhere to start
Giggled at Liverpool beating Stoke 1 0 thinking about last year and all
Do this for the 2003 04 season
urgh probably the only team to lose to sunderland Most depressing night this season
I will see if I can come up with scores this time haha AhC
Ah ok that went over my head P
I think he does often play as a right back he s right footed
Let s talk about facts
Credit to our lord and savior Omar
Bbbbbbbbbbbbbale
Marcelo Azevedo
where did Koscielny play before I thought he had been a centre back since the beginning of his career at Guingamp Tours Lorient
idk lol it all happened so fast
wow does anyone have a gif of Ward s skill to get around kaboul just now i think it was an elastico or nutmeg too quick to tell
after triumphantly turning into Diamond Palace last match v Liverpool I fully expect Palace to play like Tin Palace and go 0 2 down against Sunderland today within 20 minutes
Maybe Sarfaraz Ahmed 48 off 46 and Misbah 68 off 72 to win that match against SL in dying light in Jan 2014 Also definitely Sehwag 83 off 68 v England he turned a draw into a win Finally Sarwan and Chanderpaul chatting 418 v Aus in 2003
Apparently pontus wernbloom and Cheick Tiot
Is there not a rule in place that prevents loanees from playing against their parent club
Ah ok
That pass to Arnautovic was class don t know who did it tho
City 3 0 Liverpool
alt f4 is a shortcut on pc to immediately close all active Windows
Are Maxim and Pantilimon unfit
yeah I think it s Buffon Barzagli Chiellini Bonucci Darmian Florenzi Soriano Marchisio El Shaarawy Eder Pell
nice thanks for the threadDamn number 66 is not looking good today
That s Marcio Azevedo i really don t know why he s at Shakhtar or how he s been doing but he was average to shit in Brazil
But he always had 5 Star skills on FIFA
he has 4 get your shit together
He had 5 in FIFA 12
i am aware always had not sound weird to anyone else tho plus he wasn t even on fut 14 and 15
Fifa 12 13 legend
Probably has a very good agent
Most big teams get the world class brazillian talent Shakhtar ends up mostly with average ones Jadson Douglas Costa and William are probably exceptions
Not really most of their offensive buys were once a great prospect here Bernard did extremely well in Brazil and won Libertadores with Atletico Fred was bought early in his Internacional career but he was already highly rated Taison was great at Internacional where he also won the Libertadores Wellington Nem who hasn t been playing also did quite well at Fluminense and was considered a young prospect in Brazil Alex Teixeira was as highy rated as Coutinho in the beginning of their career at Vasco Then you have Fernandinho Douglas Costa Jadson Willian The average players they get are defenders like Marcio Azevedo and Ismaily
I am actually brazillian too but now living in Spain I know the trajetory of most of the players you mentioned and we have to be honest there is a reason a lot of talented players dont suceed or arent as great as they look the brazillian league isnt on a high level for something about 10 12 years most of the talent ends up being not even close to world class when they come to Europe
me and every other brazilian fan might agree that the league isn t nowhere near as it once was but still those players were good young prospects once if they turn out to be world class or not that s another thing
Marcelo Azevedo

That was the most hardman nutmeg and lob combination i ve ever seen Awesome
Dani is a warrior It s criminal that Danilo has started over him
He looks like he spends his spare time lumberjacking
What a goal from a right back with his weak foot
dani and luka scoring in the same match i m not crying you re crying
Ronaldo with a goal and two assists
Assist of the year right there
it s almost as good as busquet s assist
Master playmaker Anderson
Hans J rg Butt is the real deal
I m a fan of Tom Carroll s assist to Bale
that is beautiful Robben was certainly lucky to have a guy like Butt helping him to get on the scoresheet
I miss him
He s OUR Anderson now
Prefer this one from Xavi
HAHAHAHA Klopp
Busquet will remind that for the rest of his life He will tell his grandsons about that one for sure
Exquisite passing
here go
Savage
this is a real madrid post get that barcelona trash out of here
you see those men in white
Well real madrid are in the gif
This one too mate http youtu be yWVrolNQ4RU
Talk about being bitter lol
Still bummed out about last weekend
I don t think he s a Madrid fan
Why is this the top comment
Still managed to miss few chances
Decoy90 Okay so where s the real banter
No banter whatsoever I m glad he s back in form but he can be even better
He s just scored again lol But I don t believe he s back in form
Exactly how I feel It s going great for him but it doesn t feel like he s in top form I mean it s two assists and two goals can t be much better on paper but there is room for improvement
Can he even get back to form his knee problem isn t gonna go away with playing more lol
That is an excellent goal
Azevedo still living off his Fifa 13 self because it s clearly not working out for him irl
hahaha 5 skills
Where are the people saying Carvajal isnt offensive
Sweet nutmeg but surely that shove would be a foul right
Best goal of the night for me
Carvajal Danilo
Carvajal is just as good attacking as he is at defending Danilo is just as bad attacking as he is defending
what a goal
Has to be a starter this guy
What a rough game number 66 is having Also great goal from carvajal
What s with the recent explosionin the number of fullback goals
Fullback envy sweeping Europe
I love how he just nutmegs him and as the defender is trying to recover he just shoves him to the side
Isn t that a foul on 66
That was unexpected
hnnng fucking awesome
Yasss
nice curl
I can t tell if that was a cross or a shot Still a sexy goal regardless
Am I the only one for whom none of the streamable links are working right now
Why was the camera so zoomed in Thought it was a replay at first
The Shakhtar defenders find new ways to be crap for each goal
Does anyone have a normal angle Absolutely hate that let s zoom in on one player crap
Carvajal going James on this one
Jesus chris what a belter
What exactly is a belter supposed to mean I always assumed it meant fast hard and direct
yea that wasn t a belter by any means
Goalazo
What a cross
Ronaldo must be pissed at that
deleted
huh
I m surprised to see Ronaldo do those fakes I ve heard that he hasn t done many dribbling tricks recently Or is that just talking about 5 star skill type stuff
He hasn t done any skill to put a defender behind in like i don t even know Those fakes he does them every day
OK I don t really watch Madrid games I d rather not stay up until 5am for a game that isn t Arsenal the Socceroos or a World Cup finalSorry man I know you want to praise your defender but if Sterling put that on target either to Buffon s left or right that would have gone in It was a terrible miss from Sterling no defending could have saved you there

Felix Brych is such a terrible referee woeful calls all across the game Edit Every fucking year as well God fucking damnit
What A Goal
Anybody have any idea what s going on with Hart
Feeling a red card coming The players are getting fed up with it all
Unable to go back since I m relying on other people s streams Normally I would be able to go back into the match to grab that for you but now tonight Sorry mate
Cross was by Alex Sandro

Maybe try selecting a role for him in that position that s what I do So instead of CM Playing position select CM Central Midfielder That s what I do when I want to re train my player and it seems to help
He s still at United in 2018 in my save Getting decent amount of apps but not a key player United did buy Kane in their first season so they play him instead
Getting no yellows is pretty difficult thing to do Your players will make tactical fouls and or lose their head and make rash challenges It s pretty much impossible to not get carded at least once in a game
Can I see your squad I m currently playing with Gent and I m only in 2018 so I m still struggling a bit
Get Zabaleta
HOLY SHIT BOYS THEY DID IT Belgium is proud of you
Pretty fucking stupid that two four steps are guarded
That first minute red card though
Probably Pardew
Fuck I didn t get Bolasie s skill that lost him the ball in itSorry i just went off of what the article said not very knowledgable about Sweden Thanks for correcting that
Thats actually an awesome picture thanks for posting it
After they see how he handles Messi and Neymar at the Euros they will definitely sign him
3978 miles to go see Belgium in a friendly against the US in Cleveland Ohio Well worth it
Jelle Vossen from Burnley to Club Brugge is comfirmed Signed a 5 year contract
LvG s Notes
Ghost corner in Belgian first division game
How about Vidic s double tackle
Belgium put up their tent in Cyprus box hopefully some goals follow real soon here Starting to look like shooting practice out there
De Bruyne Gotze Kagawa
Robot Celebration
Same goes for The Netherlands sometimes they are referred to as just Holland while this is technically not the whole of The Netherlands It would be the same as referring to Great Britain s team as England
I like it but using Fellaini next De Bruyne feels funny to me In the future we d have Thorgan Musonda Jr or Praet for that spot Not that I rate them that highly but just seems like a position better fit for them
I agree with your future midfield line up In 4 6 years Tielemans Malanda Musinda would ve been a massive midfield Kind of like Witsel Fellaini Defour back in Standards days
I feel you My choice for Origi is based on the fact that i feel he will have a growth period in the next two years that will make him more compatible with the players around him like Hazard and De Bruyne He is more unpredictable than Lukaku in the field but I got to give Lukaku credit though As for Benteke he seems to be having trouble finding his form maybe a transfer to a bigger team make change that for him
Belgium for Euros 2016 not much difference from WC2014 GK Courtois RB Meunier CB Kompany CB Alderweireld LB Vertonghen CDM Witsel CDM Niangolan RM Mirallas CAM De Bruyne LM Hazard ST Origi
Probably pretty unknown but Tom De Mul Belgian winger who spent his youth at Ajax similar route as Vertonghen Vermaelen and Alderweireld Managed to get a transfer to Sevilla which wasn t a bad club at the time but couldn t stay fit so retired when he was 28 last year Also Arsenal s Diaby and Spurs s King
They forgot Toby Alderweireld on loan at Southampton from Atletico Madrid and ex Ajax And of course other but thought he deserved a mention since Southampton is second in the BPL atm
I don t know if he counts yet since he hasn t proven himself in a top competition yet but Martin Odegaard is 15 years old and made his debut for Norway s national team already http youtu be Smi8jvNixL8
Thank you This is awesome I didn t know any of this Missed those good years sadly
Thank you so much that s so interesting Didn t know any of this How old was Totti when Real Madrid bid for him
Can someone tell me more about the hype around Totti and Pirlo when they were younger I was way too young to remember how they started out and i feel they ve been left out of this discussion
I feel that PSG would try to bring back Eric Gerits back to France He s familiar with the French way of playing and was a solid coach at Marseille Would be a surprise though Maybe even give Zidane a chance although these two are both Marseille men at heart you never know what money will do
Carlos Puyol will possibly make a good future coach He used to always be driven to steer his fellow team mates to stay focused and play their position correctlyI wonder if the defenders had played that to the end would Ronaldo still had made that weak header or would he have done something different They would ve certainly got to that if they didn t stop playing EDIT Also that defender marking Ronaldo should probably try to keep an eye on his man
Id be furious as a manager if I saw that heck even as a fan Id be mad
heck Please watch your language
it s a family show
I don t give a crud
Just imagine what kind of foul language we d be seeing if he was the manager
You kiss your mother with that mouth
Makes me think of the WC qualifier knockout between Sweden and Portugal Guys this Ronaldo chap is pretty good keep an eye on him
yea to be honest that should have been stopped Also on side note you can clearly see the lack of form he is still in with that attempt on net A form ronaldo would have put a solid effort on net Regardless goal and hopefully it helps him and the rest of us get back up from that loss sat
I know Ronaldo s fast but that afro guy didn t even try there until the pass was already on it s way
that Shakhtar defender
Defender
Hooooooly shit imagine letting the best player in the world run into your box in acres of space Edit I guess I mean one of the best thanks for the downvotes you morons
Wow 20 downvotes for asserting that Ronaldo might be the best player in the world
i mean it really is an absurd contention at this point
Didn t see Messi in the video
What was that number 66 doing
Gee I think that s Ronaldo
Dude couldn t be bothered to track back 10 feet Would have been an easy clearance The center back too looks like he could ve got there but he gets caught giving up before the ball is even in Not that the goal was his fault though
It was actually number 99 doing a handstand
He looks more like a rugby player than a footballer
probably hoping it would lead to a counter attack didn t really work out
that defending reminded me of this IRL lag posted over at r gifs by u fromthepharcyde
He s to my right I got him
What a pass by Bale
Modrics pass That was magic
Wouldn t mind seeing Modric at Bar a
Dude what is wrong with you
The Croatian double team with Rakitic Triple with Kovacic It s sexual
Croatian here By watching them play at the Croatian national team I would say they would do fuck all with all due respect to them they are indivudually amazing players Never seen them mesh together well though
Am I sexuuallll yeeeaaahhh Am I everything you need you better rock your gameplay now
He is a benfiquista
Just thought it would be amazing to see him playing there not that I dislike him at Real
Could anyone explain to me why he s being downvoted to oblivion I m genuinely curious as I don t understand what is going on here S Edit I m relatively unknowledgeable which is why I m trying to learn more
Probably because of the rivalry between Barca and Real It s like saying I d like to see Marcelo at Barca or Pique at Real
Ah okay thanks for the answer I appreciate it
Not sure if he was trying a Nacho goal of his own
Pardon me if this is a joke but Bale was going for goal
LOL yes he did think he missed the goal
Does fantastic to spot the run and then be able to float it over
Much credit to Bale for Cristiano s goal
Huh Bale He made a simple pass which was actually just a wide shot The real credit for this goal should go to Modric not Bale or Ronaldo He created this goal solely Ronaldo and Bales part could be done by a U 13 to be honest
Not sure what U 13 would be able to make that run or chip that Bale did I think you are selling him very short
I don t think you realise which players are which in this clip
Not if you ask Cristiano at least in this clip
Hurr durr ronaldo is so selfish
Le arrogant Cristiano amirite
You idiot Edit that s all I could say initially This 10 second clip wasn t long enough to show the part where he serenades Bale
I would ve broken my skull on that post
As soon as ronaldo started running towards it I got scared
wtf was that dude doing trailing ronaldo as if he wasn t going to score
Well me must ve just thought Oh well in Benitez s system Ronaldo has about 1 5th the shots he usually does Especially now that Neymar Suarez and Messi are playing so well Cristiano likely suspects he won t make the the three man list for the Ballon D Or leading to a loss of spirits which along side his knee injury and age can be attributed to his loss of recent form that is a greater part of his decline No need to follow him here
And then Oh shit
You really put some thought into this huh
Felaini really let himself go
Good team goal
Im glad Bale is looking healthy Hopefully he can keep it up
Inzaghi would be proud
Quite bad defending do they not realize how fast Bale is Great play by Bale and Modric though
They guy covering Cristiano is the true criminal here if you ask me He just kinda watched as Cristiano ran passed him
Oh man what a pass from Modric
Impure
Fck that was close
Madrid doing their best impression of Barca s goal the other day
Tapinaldo
7 10 players would probably miss that
Yeah those open net shots from 6 inches are insanely hard
No they wouldn t
Those passes though
meh
Well that almost ended tragically
I WANT TO HAVE MODRICS BABIES
what is it with defenders just ignoring ronaldo and allowing him to stroll unmarked into scoring positions
Number 66 is good
knock off Marcelo definitely didn t help
wow Modric
the world is a better place when Cristiano Ronaldo is scoring goals
Defender 86 might wanna mark the second best player in the world a little closer than that Just a thought
Neymar played yesterday unless you mean Suarez who also played yeterday
Goddamn can t a guy make a joke on an internet forum without dickheads being all sanctimonious about arbitrary rankings of grown men Fuck s sake
Seems like you can t take a joke either m8
s Just bants man BANTZ
Unless you mean Iniesta
Is he dare I say it Back
Bale assists Ronaldo Ronaldo pretends Bale don t be here
That defender running with Bale was pathetic but he made up for it by kicking the ball out of the goal after it had crossed the line
what the ACTUAL FUCK was 66 doing what the fuck was he thinking
Typical goal by him But that pass by Modric though
Ronaldo goals lack the flair they used to come with These recent ones look like spoon fed boringness
how was the celebration
Reminds me kinda of Barca s fantastic MSN goal yesterday actually Great for Ronaldo though he really needed that bit of confidence
Reminds you in what exactly In both the ball went inside
He s most likely mentioning those over top sort of flick balls into the area
yes that I thought r soccer was football forum where people understood the game lol no
This sub is pretty bad for serious discussion
Only if you have a Real Madrid flair and or try to compare anything other than gods to Barcelona s players
your understanding of the game is so deep man You recognized a forward over the top pass as similar to another goal Can Real Madrid hire you already
Good one jackass
How can you not see the similarities
You tell me
Well both are goals scored in a Champions League football game if that s what you mean
Great for Ronaldo the new kid on the block seems to have the potential to now aim for greater heights and probably play for Segunda someday
Almost scored on the same play ten minutes later but the next time the keeper stayed in goal to save Ronaldo s header
dont thank bale
But all the couch managers here told me that Ronaldo should be benched I don t even know if those people were serious or just blinded by their hate of this man
Good point he really proved everyone wrong by heading it in unmarked from about 6 inches outside the goal World class finish Ronaldo showing his best definitely not Bale and Modric
Only the GOAT can score goal like that
He scored and that s enough Doesn t matter how We can t be 100 sure that this situation and goal would have occurred without Ronaldo Also I am not trying to put Bale or Modric down I m just saying that people that never touched a ball in their lives should not make stupid comments Even if it s biased or because they hate him it s still retarded to say that real should bench him
He scored and that s enough Everything that is wrong with football viewers in the past 5 10 years
You do know that the objective of football is to outscore an opponent If this is wrong with football viewers then what do you suggest is right
Have a holistic view of football Goals and assists are just the final 2 moves in a chain of events I am not gonna pretend that they are not important but to pontificate on them at the exclusion of everything else is what is wrong with football analysis at the moment I blame Messi and Ronaldo
Mate you re making that assumption of me based on this post alone I m not saying that goals are everything I m a defender and love clean tackles more than anything I m just saying when a player especially a forward scores a goal or two then he has done his job
He s hardly proved anyone wrong This is the kind of goal that someone in a slump can score without changing their future performances one bit because it doesn t do shit for confidence If someone who could actually make runs and be a threat offensively had started there is no way to be 100 sure it wouldn t be 0 3 already
Lol the last paragraph is enough for me to understand that you are probably one of those who do not watch his matches regularly but still like to shit on him
Your comment history is enough for me to understand that you have a reputation for starting and encouraging circlejerks in the past I understand it s new for you to be on the other side for once
Yeah unfortunately you ve come across Shaqiriii the one user you can guarantee will be at the bottom of every thread he comments in I d ignore the guy
Oh believe me I know who he is Just another guy who views reddit as a platform for starting arguments
That still does not change what I said You try to get back at me but it does not change that you re probably one of those couch managers that like to speak a lot without knowing much
I actually haven t said shit about Ronaldo before I saw your comment today I just thought you were just waiting for an opportunity to pretend like you re right about Ronaldo even if he doesn t actually perform well
I never said anything about Ronaldo s recent form so no I wasn t waiting for something like this to comment that I was right Check my history if you re bored and that interested in it or take my word for it
Of course not I wasn t implying that all 400k of us in r soccer were just watching for a comment by you specifically But I can guarantee that you had a preformed opinion about Ronaldo s form and you were waiting for anything that you thought would allow you to get upvoted via hivemind Unfortunately for you this isn t enough for a reasonable person to say that Ronaldo has regained his form So you got downvoted
American flair Your argument is invalid
America flair Your argument is invalid
Is it really
Asshole spotted comment worthless
American Real Madrid fan Argument is garbage
And so is your attitude Grow up
Yeah nobody else could ve scored an empty net header Maybe he deserved the bench maybe not but one easy goal against Shakhtar isn t a good indicator
He never deserves the bench Maybe he can be rested in unimportant matches but claiming that he should be benched is just either being biased or clueless Even he plays bad there is no replacement Who would he be benched for
People don t want to bench him because someone else plays better it s because the bench could motivate Ronaldo to work harder and get back in form It s not a difficult concept to understand managers do it all the time with underperforming stars Pique Enrique Hazard Mou
There are different ways to motivate players Playing bad should be enough motivation for him to get back to his level He is a hard worker and dedicated I don t think motivation is the problem Maybe it s his issues with his legs or the managers tactics not clicking but I do not think its motivation Who knows
Man you defend Ronaldo with all your heart Are you his publicist by the way Has he thanked you for it yet
Oh look it s my number one fan Nice to see you too
So I ll take it he hasn t thanked you Man must be hard you must spend several hours on the internet arguing and defending him only for him not to notice
Well at least you get some appreciation from me for being such a good fan So at least one of us is being thanked
TIL defending a player on Reddit being a good fan Damn why didn t nobody tell me going to away games is costly If someone had told me I could show my appreciation to my team just by defending a player on the internet I would gladly save up some money for more important things
Couch managers lol
A lot of Madrid fans who don t hate Ronaldo have also asked for him to be benched so it s not just people who hate this man
Lol madrid fans C mon man a lot of Real and Barca fans here are a bunch of gloryhunters that will turn on their stars as soon as they stop performing It s not only people here even in the stadiums in Spain they turn on their own players It s not like I think that a comment is more believable if a Real fan makes them or the other way around with Barca
I m not talking about reddit look at Madrid forums on the internet read what many are saying and many claim Ronaldo is past it and that he should be benched And yeah like you said the Bernab u as well My point is that people who have said Ronaldo should be benched are not always blinded by hatred like you stated
Fair enough but I said I don t know if they are serious or biased That means that it s worse if they re unbiased and serious in my opinion And both fanbases are not the most stable ones so I take whatever madrid and Barca fans say with a grain of salt
A tap and 5 on Soccer sad
I thought he was past it
Yup that was an incredible finish Definetly shows the true Cristiano is back
Haha I I was just joking
nah Ronaldo has ended his goal drought with this 3 yard screamer so all his critics have been proven wrongLes yeux dans les bleus is a really great football documentary
Yes Maybe one of the best there is
True
technically it is always one of the best
What No A bad documentary couldn t be technically considered as one of the best
why not Did you define how many are the best It can be part of the 10000 best
Then technically I m one of the world s best footballers
technically you are

A description of how Ronaldo plays Foo foo foo foo foo
And It s gone Children in Africa could ve eaten that ball
Best 9 ever I m not even kidding
It s crazy considering he was at his best when playing for Barcelona before his injuries He was like 21 Imagine how good he would have been without injuries
He was so amazing that even later in his career when he was fat as fuck burdened by years of injuries and hypothyroidism he was scoring like just a regular world class player at Milan and one of the highest scorers in the WC He had set such high standards that all people could talk about late career Ronaldo was how shit he was
Even when at Real Madrid he was amazing yet nowhere near as good as his earlier years A lot of people seem to think his prime was at Real Madrid when he was actually much better at PSV Barca and Inter
Imagine what would happen if he stayed at Barcelona and later teamed up with Kluivert Jesus Christ
One season at Barca 47 goals in 49 games Then he left for a better contract no fucks given
Puskas and Gerd Muller would like a word They d all be up there though
Muller was an excellent goal scorer but that s it The purest poacher the world has ever seen but not a pure 9 like Ronaldo
I want my striker number 9 whatever you call him to score goals If he does it by dribbling past three players and scoring or poaching them it s the same result I would take the flashier one there But Gerd Muller also scored much more goals than Ronaldo so that weighs in his favor I guess for a game in their prime I would take Ronaldo Over a career I d take Muller Puskas was a good mix of both though
It s silly to compare Puskas and Muller to Ronaldo and declare who the better 9 is Let s not act like all 3 didn t put up video game numbers The former two might have scored 3 goals per match with their dicks but I don t think a pure poacher could ever pull that off in Ronaldo s era
M ller was pretty good at everything actually His goals were typical poacher goals but he was fairly involved in the game
Well its whatever works Ronaldo may be one of the best players i ve ever been alive to see but i ve seen better strikers Suarez for one may actually be one of the best strikers i ve seen in a long time in that he s incredibly intelligent incredibly consistent and incredibly athletic The best player i ve ever seen is Messi best playmaker i ve ever seen is a tough one but i d give it to Iniesta or Zidane and best forward is a toss up between Ronaldo or Cristiano Ronaldo Best dribbler has to be Ronaldinho but I ve seen Neymar one up him once or twice Its nice to look at our childhood heroes with a nostalgic nod but Ronaldo s career was plagued with injuries and a little more disappointment than a lot of people care to remember He was the focal point of one of the most talented squads in recent history which is a high honor in itself But as far as pure 9s go i ve seen better Shevchenko for example was a better striker Ronaldo was definitely more talented but goals are goals
u wot
The same people who think Ronaldo is the undisputed best striker of all time ever are the same people that think Ronaldinho is a top 10 player Paul Scholes is the best midfielder of his generation and Zidane is the sleeper hit of his generation There have been better strikers than Ronaldo as early as Thierry Henry in 2004 While his technique was flawless and his athleticism was incredible at one point he merely set the standard a standard that has been reached more than once in the last decade I fully accept anybody people calling him what he is a legend but being il fenomino doesn t make you the best of all time ever His entire career was defined by 8 years 1994 2002 8 nearly perfect years but there have been better scorers better forwards and faster players side then
Rofl Here is Luis Enrique s last week interview about Ronaldo I d seen him on television at PSV and thought wow Then he came to Barcelona He s the most spectacular player I ve ever seen He did things I d never seen before We re now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players but not then
Wow Current Barcelona manager has nothing but praise for former teammate and club legend Ronaldo Seriously People need to relax
Shearer too
Suarez will be in with a shout in a few years if he isn t already
how old are you if you don t mind me asking Ive watched r9 in his prime and currently enjoying suarez While suarez will no doubt go down as one of the great forwards R9 will for a long time be the best ever to play in the position There is no arguing this fact what he did back then was ridiculous Remember this was also an era when little touch didn t end of being called a foul An era when slide tackling was such a big part of the game It was a golden era for defenders
Asking his age comes across as a little condescending The things Suarez has achieved especially after only recently coming into a top team are incredible He s a magnificent player and his all around work effort I m sure puts Ronaldo s to shame Suarez is only 28 and if he maintains this level and remains injury free for another 4 years or so then we would truly be talking about one of if not the greatest strikers ever
lol not how i meant it what i meant was if he got a chance to see ronaldo on live tv or even live but yea
Team achievements shouldn t decide which player was better Ronaldo dominated La Liga at age 19 or 20 Suarez was having a good debut season in the Eredivisie at that age I m not sure if your age comment means that you really haven t watched him back in the day but if not I can only recommend watching some video footage of him He really wasn t called el fenoemno for nothing Even after his injury he was still playing on an incredible level so there will always be this big if concerning what could have been sadly And I definitely know how good Suarez is
LOL NO
I m 27 I m the perfect age to have some childhood bias for R9 Suarez is very close if not as good He s been dominating leagues for years
Suarez is not any where near as prolific but the comparison bears merit if only because they have a VERY similar playing style
I m 35 Suarez is miles away from the best Ronaldo The Ronaldo at Barcelona was not just the best player around he totally and utterly dominated the game He was unplayable
He carried mediocre Inter squad to ultra competitive Seria A in his first year only finishing 2nd due to controversial match vs Juve Also carried them to win UEFA cup Suarez is a beast but Ronaldo prior his 2x knee injuries was just on whole another level
controversial Nice euphemism
I think people tend to give more weight to what they see now R9 was truly one of the most dominant players I ve even seen And I m old
The sentiment that Suarez is as good or better as ronaldo was would ve been extremely dumb in the time period between 2010 and 2012 where he helped take Uruguay to the World Cup semi finals and the Copa America title and it would ve been just a tad controversial when he took Liverpool to a second place finish with a POTY worthy display But a treble and a clasico rout later I don t think its fair to undersell him any longer Suarez is exceptional and any notion that he isn t at Ronaldo s level is just weird I m not actually sure if there s anything Ronaldo could do back in the day that Suarez can t do now The only thing separating them is 3 biting incidents and a bit of racism
Ronaldo is still a class above believe it or not The speed power control finishing
not even close
Suarez is awesome deffo 1 striker right now I still believe R9 was the most talented forward out there though He was basically an upgraded Suarez faster stronger with better ball control 34 goals in 37 matches for Barcelona at age 21 Phenomenal And then injuries hit Also is it just me or did Suarez get smaller in Barcelona He was a boar in Liverpool and now he looks lanky
He may look less bulky but he s as strong as ever
Not really Probably not even top 10 since 2000
Name 10 better since 2000 then
I m not really agreeing with u KrisDoolan but this seemed a nice exercise to do so here we go I did not include CR7 because I consider him more a winger than a 9 Otherwise he d obviously be with the 5 guys above Suarez Players I ranked above Suarez ie if I ran a team and had to choose between prime Suarez and prime player X I d go for player X without thinking about it too much Ronaldo Raul Henry Messi Rooney Players that I rank kind of the same level as Suarez with the same reasoning as above I d have to think a long time before choosing between prime Suarez and prime player X Ibrahimovic Shevchenko Van Nistelrooy Drogba Eto o Totti Tevez Aguero Pre Chelsea Torres Benzema
Half the strikers you listed are mostly known for exceptional finishing They are essential for turning a really good team into a great team The wonderful thing about Suarez though is that he brings so much more than just scoring goals to the table He is absolutely essential for Barca s pressing He was playing both finisher and playmaker for Liverpool When Suarez left Liverpool they simply could not fill the hole in the team The other players you mentioned were wonderful players but teams can cope fairly well when they lose strikers like Van Nistelrooy Raul and Shevchenko
Of the prime player X in the first scenerio only Henry Messi and Ronaldo have a case against Suarez Of the 10 in the second pool only Shevchenko has a case Suarez is comfortably better than all the rest Rooney was great in his prime but nothing to write home about Drogba is my fav striker but Anelka was always better he s just a better captain Eto o Tevez Totti and Ibrahimovich are cult icons but they re not without competition Aguero Benzema Torres and Van Nistelrooy have always been effective and efficient but Suarez has always played a much bigger and better role for club and country And Raul wasn t that good Having scoring records doesn t make you the best striker ever He was great but Real Madrid had no problem replacing him or Van Nistelrooy for that matter when the time came I d liken them to Inzaghi great club legend not the best striker None of them compare to Suarez in the slightest
Del Piero Vieri Van Basten Baggio Bergkamp Batistuta They would all be above Suarez I d say
Rooney even at his prime better than Suarez lol
Props for putting in the effort Would take Suarez ahead of Rooney and Raul Also ahead of Shevchenko RVN Dorgba Totti Tevez Torres probably Karim as well Only one on that list I would absolutely without question take ahead of Suarez would be Messi and he s not actually a striker
Ronaldo Henry Van Nistelrooy prime Shevchenko prime Torres Raul Ibrahimovic Eto o Del Piero Aguero
good list you forgot prime Falcao comparing him to Ronaldo fenomeno is just silly they are different worlds
I was going to mention Falcao because he was an absolute monster at Atletico but I believe this is only his second ever season of Champions League football so I was kind of reluctant to put him in there
I d rather have him on my team over everyone else except maybe Henry Ronaldo and prime Shevchenko
Definite no on Van Nistlerooy Shevchenko Torres Raul Eto o Del Piero Aguero Other three are maybe s at best
I m sorry but motherfucking Ronaldo is not a maybe at best I think you re either massively exaggerating how good Suarez is or you don t remember just how good some of those players were Van Nistelrooy especially had a much better scoring record especially in the Champions League likewise with Shevchenko Raul and Eto o
Nostalgic revisionism I think you re overrating a number of those players especially RVN Sheva Raul
Ruud set a number of records for his goalscoring exploits and had an absolutely ridiculous record in Europe same goals per game as Messi and higher than Ronaldo Shevchenko won the Ballon d Or and is Milan s 2nd all time top scorer only behind Gunnar Nordahl It took Messi and Ronaldo until last year to beat Raul s CL goals record He was Real Madrid s top scorer ever until the start of the season Suarez has achieved shit compared to them
Trying not to be biased but you are really underestimating Del Piero one of the best Italian players to every play the game
What could ve been Ironic that both he and Ronaldo arguably the two most promising and best strikers in the world at that time would end up having their career ruined by their knees
Why would you be kidding He is the best number 9 of all time
I still don t think Brazil would ve won if Ronaldo was fully fit in the final but they would have played much better in attack
Its simple break his fucking legs
Thanks Roy Keane
FOU FOU FOU
Nice Fortunately for them Ronaldo ended up playing one of his worst ever games in that final
Well his name wasn t even on the teamsheet before the match it was a last minute decision to play him Doctor Lidio Toledo revealed the striker had been rushed to hospital after suffering a convulsion in his sleep but cleared to play after neurological and cardiac tests Such a shame really http news bbc co uk sport3 worldcup2002 hi history newsid 1749000 1749324 stm EDIT Also many other theories as to what happened the night before
There s a strong rumour that he was forced to play by sponsors most notably Nike
This
to this day I still believe the rumors that he was poisoned by the French in their hotel
he was definitely not 100 in that match The disparity between the final and the previous games is absurd Like two completely different players
Probably shouldn t have played at all
Cool seeing them all giddy like a fan would be seeing skill like that up close
Why is this unverified
This is amazing
Watching him in his prime was mesmerizing Just simply unplayable regardless of the talent you put against him

OM also lost Fanni and Lemina
Considering how big the population of France is it s strange how they never produced elite teams like Spain England Germany and Italy They ve had sporadic success but nothing consistent
That has nothing to do with population though Portugal has 10 million inhabitants and they have successfull teams in an european scale Aside from PSG french teams are not attractive enough because we do not have enough money to pay premier league like wages due to fiscality low tv rights deals less attractivity
My point is going back to the start of European football why did no huge teams develop in France like they did in other countries The national team wasn t great either until the 80s
Because historically rugby was a bigger sport in France than football
Oh ok I knew rugby was popular in France but had no idea it was actually bigger than football
Higher percentage of the French population plays rugby than in NZ In the south especially it s all rugby country
The french rugby league top 14 is the biggest rugby league in the world
In the southwest this is true but absolutely not anywhere north of the Loire and at least doubtful in the southeast
I don t think there s any way around the fact that France is an outlier The top 4 leagues are 4 of the 5 most populous nations in Western Europe Portugal may have strong teams league relative to population size but they re still well behind Spain England Germany and Italy
I was once told that in France the taxes alone of you declare over 1M income are upwards of 50 and to keep the big names happy and staying in PSG the Qataris actually cover those extra taxes for the players Not sure how true it is though
Not enough money Atletico s budget is comparable to that of Marseille and Lyon and they reached the CL final while OL and OM have a combined 0 1 10 in their last CL games Also was money the problem when Lyon got ONE point out of 6 against Gent When they were eliminated by APOEL When they were eliminated by Astra Giurgiu When PSG couldn t qualify for EL s round of 32 in a group with Slovan Bratislava and Red Bull Salzburg Let me be clear Ligue 1 sucks and PSG s titles have never felt so hollow But quit trying to find excuses for your poor management French football has never been at a lowest point in decades PSG is our only ray of light but then again We are owned by a dictatorship This situation sucks so much I fucking hate it
Actually Atletico s budget is around 190 million euros Marseille for this season has a budget of 125 million euros A huge part of the budget is dedicated to salaries As a fellow french you should know that the fiscality is very high compared to Spain Marseille for instance had to renovate their stadium same can be said for Lyon with their new stadium It is estimated that Marseille lost 26 million euros over 3 years because of that don t know about Lyon but given it is their stadium and they paid for it the loss is huge Also we had to sell key players this summer so we could conform with FFP regulations Gignac left for free Payet Imbula Ayew left Nkoulou and Mandanda will be leaving FOR FREE at the end of the season We can not just pay premier league like wages because we simply do not have the money to Sure there is probably a problem in terms of management but for some reason and probably others I m far from being knowledgeable on the subject we lack the money to compete internationaly Best clubs are the richest that s all
We lack the money to compete internationally How do you explain that Portuguese clubs constantly trample ours That teams from Cyprus eliminated OL and Nice Danish club eliminated Saint Etienne
French clubs tend not to take europa league seriously because there is little financial reward with a huge investment given that there is way more fixtures in an already overbooked schedule See Christophe Galtier comment a year ago or so Portuguese clubs bring very talented players from south america through third party ownership and anyway the transfer fee is low Plus their academy is on point
That s true but I don t what your point is Are you saying that money isn t the main problem and Portuguese clubs are much better managed than us
I was just explaining why they have more success than us with a lower budget
Well that s kind of my point isn t it If we recruited better and if we took Europe more seriously we wouldn t be in this situation
Incomparable
Comparable In 2013 2014 Atletico s budget was 170M Marseille s 130 One went to the Final of the CL the other 0 0 6 in the group stages
Ah I see what you mean although there are other factors to consider as well
Of course of course But we in France always like to blame it on money I m saying that s really not our main problem
It is very strange only one winner in all of European Cup Champions League history
When has the EPL had consistent success in Europe outside of 04 09
Through the 70s and 80s across each competition
How so
A team in the european cup final 9 times between 1975 1985 7 times winners Spread across 4 different teams imagine any league doing the same now
Look up European Cup finals between 1976 and 1985
Ah I took his statement to mean two decades of dominance though I think the run was from 76 84
England were solid from 70 76 dominant from 76 85 and probably would have continued to be for a little while if not for the Heysel disaster
England were solid from 70 76 Might want to extend that window a bit m8 I mean who could forget our stunning Inter Cities Fairs Cup victory over jpesti D zsa in 1969
English and German teams pretty much exclusively dominated European football in the 70s and 80s until Heysel
The fact that almost none of them own their own stadia and rent from local councils really holds them back
Don t forget that Lyon also have Fekir unavailable due to his torn ACL that he got two months ago
Saint Etienne also sold Maximin to Monaco if that counts
So you are saying the league is shit Except for PSG
The league is poor
Ligue 1 is being bought out by the big 4 leagues but it s France s fault Why aren t French clubs offering bigger contracts bar PSG
LOL Clubs can t type rosebud IRL you re pretty much asking why a single mom working as a waitress can t buy a Lambo
Euuh because they don t have the money You know that with all the taxes a player costs to his Ligue 1 club 17 times what he would cost to a spanish club And if the player ends up being injured or shit DNCG will make sure you re relegated France is not Spain
It s France s fault exactly Not French clubs fault Here over 1M a year 50 goes to the country Under it s more complicated but let s say about 25 So if you want a player to earn 5M a year the club has to pay 9 5M approximately And I have probably forgotten A LOT of things I actually don t know shit about this juste it s super high tax here for high salaries Plus French club aren t wealthy compared to English clubs because English clubs are the main problem Spanish German Italian too but mainly English PS I love MKP Was a big fan during the MKP DRG area at MLG

PSG should just start playing David Luiz as striker just for laughs
Fifa irl
That s not healthy
Not for my blood pressure certainly
This kills the Ligue 1
Solution Espanyol and Barcelona to Ligue 1
Blame it on PSG if you want but Lyon only has 25 points after 14 games that s really not a lot for a 2nd
So everyone in the league is bad It s just PSG are average
I d rather say everyone in the league is average beside PSG who are good Nice lost against Ajaccio and Nantes but went to beat Lyon and Marseille for example PSG can afford to keep their best players which brings stability Marseille and Monaco lost half their team during summer Only Lyon kept their players wages were raised but eventually they lost F kir
Didn t Monaco lose half their team due to a change in policy They have plenty of money right They could have retain some players
It s a mixture of things but they definitely did want to mix up their squad a bit to hopefully get a better project going They let go of a lot of prospects that they felt were not panning out like Ocampos for example We lost half our squad because the club isn t very profitable any more Ayew and Labrune tried several times to extend his contract and our owner simply doesn t give a shit any more They netted 50m off of the sales of our squad this summer and she s going to sell as soon as someone offers
Things haven t been going that great for OM a shame that s happening to a team as great as you I really hope you regain your rightful place in Ligue 1
Eh thanks for the kind words but we have no right to anything in the league We get what we deserve and it s not weird that we are doing poorly given the circumstances It looks like Michel finally figured things out last weekend so I m hoping things will begin to improve
They had to sell some to break even per FFP but Martial wasn t supposed to be sold but given the 80 million offer it was impossible to reject
Why does Monaco lose so many players Aren t they still supported by a rich suggardaddy
Beside this divorce story he eventually did not lost half his money to his ex wife as far as I know they have to sell because of FFP AS Monaco because of its history has many fans in the whole France they ve one of the best away crowd But the home stadium is empty because Monaco is small and full of rich people And this can t work with FFP
He s lost basically nothing to his wife she is in huge debt and will have to completely capitulate at this point he has offered her half of what he originally offered her at the beginning of proceedings and only for 10 years rather than the rest of her life and she ll have to take it His daughter sided against the mother and basically shot down most of her case The issue is that he is happy to spend money as he has shown but he will not spend money if it means he ll have to pay millions in fines to UEFA so the policy shifted from big name star signings to young players with a lot of potential and Jardim with complete control of the squad and transfers along with a Portuguese scout he brought with him They buy low sell high and it will allow a core of players to develop and sell off one or two each season to cover the loss a like Lyon 10 years ago except a bigger safety net So they sold a lot of players one more than they wanted to Martial but obviously with 80 million on the table it was impossible to reject but the project isn t over
Yup you explained their change of policy and their new project well The only thing is that given the context it s even more difficult to create a chemistry between players in Monaco imo They had it last year and they sold everyone I doubt they can create this every year And when you bring in so many new players the risk is to miss on the CL spots Less exposure for the players and you can t sell too high beside they don t buy thaaat low they buy pretty high and want to sell very high
Makes sense I just wish that they d balanced the team better I mean yeah sell Martial for that crazy fee but then buy a good centre back and a good LB RB and another DM Then they d probably be okay Instead they have like 20 wingers and attacking midfielders and two 35 year olds playing defence
Sugardaddy that lost half his money to his ex wife IIRC
That wasn t true actually
Ok my mistake then The thing is he doesn t want to spend huge money on Monaco now so they are more a seller club than a buyer like any club in France other than Lyon or Paris The fact that English clubs are drunk with money that the french taxes cost a lot to the clubs makes the best players of the league go away and team are constantly rebuilding Plus this season PSG are performing good and all the others quite badly explaining this Actually PSG point per game is lower than Bayern per instance but Lyon has really few points for a 2nd after 14 games
We play bad while PSG play how they should with the budget they have They only have 2 draws and no loses so far
Mid and low table clubs are doing surprisingly well hello Nice and Angers Top table clubs are doing quite bad JUST LOOK AT MY CREST
It s that PSG is excellent and that other middle sized team especially Lyon Marseille and Monaco had a pretty rough start
Off topic but I can t wait to see Red Star get promoted and have a Paris derby in Ligue 1 do you think it could happen soon
Red Star is currently 6th 4 points behind Metz 3rd I honestly think it s going to be complicated this year especially since the games have to be played in Beauvais as Stade Bauer doesn t suit the league s standards But for a club like Red Star there s no need to rush sometimes it s better to spend a few years in Ligue 2 before playing with the big boys especially because of DNCG Red Star doesn t have a strong financial back up like Paris FC with fuckin Vinci
Seriously We don t blame it on PSG because we want we blame it on PSG because this is without a doubt entirely their fault PSG fans have nothing to do with it though you can t expect them to want their team to not win every game
PSG fault if teams like Lyon or Marseille underperform terribly They should have much more points by now and this thread wouldn t exist Lyon Marseille Monaco all have budgets above 100M Caen and Angers 25M Lyon lost against La Gantoise I think it s around 30M Those teams are underperforming I can t see how this is without a doubt entirely PSG fault
Can we just stop the season and call it a wrap right now I mean we all know what s going to happen the rest is just filler crap like Dragon Ball Z
Nah dude it s too interesting for us We could be top 6 or relegated nobody knows
I for one hope relegated Imagine the clusterfuck
Honestly it would just be the current clusterfuck amplified a bit and might even help get the club sold So oddly enough I m not as afraid of that as I should be Besides won t you miss the Aluas Labrune bantz
Imagine Aulas twitter with Labrune in Ligue 2 though That s just sounds like Christmas
I think we re forgetting there probably would be no more Labrune if we were relegated at least there better not be He could go to ASSE for continued banter
I would be ok with that even though CL football may kill us straight away
On the one hand Lyon have 25 points in 14 games so 25 42 which is poor for second place On the other PSG have 38 42 which is also huge That s what leads to such a disparity an extraordinarily good 1st place team but also a very mediocre second team
That is one of the consequence of the EPL being so rich The best french players used to leave France for the big 4 now they even leave top 5 teams in France to play bottom teams in England The only team that can keep its players is PSG Then english fan complain that it is easier for PSG in champion s league because Ligue1 is uncompetitive But you created the monster
Let s see there s Thauvin going to Newcastle the Ayews going to Swansea and Villa Hazard and Zouma going to Chelsea so yeah players from top 5 teams in France are leaving to play for relegation zone teams except for Swansea of course
You glossed over Payet to West Ham Azpilicueta and Remy to Chelsea
Remy left Marseille for QPR
He took the long way
I think the conversation was only about bottom half teams so fair shout on the Chelsea ones but Payet is going to a much more relevant club in West Ham which is understandable
Amavi Vertout to Villa as well
I spy the hidden bantz
Big 4 being Real Barca Bayern United
Maybe he means big 4 in England Arsenal Chelsea City United in recent memory
I think in this context the big 4 refers to Arsenal Chelsea United and Liverpool
Sky 4
Arsenal Leicester City United FTFY
Arsenal Leicester City United Leicester City so good they take up two spots in the top 4
No dude I was talking about Bristol City
Wait not Norwich City the ones who put a mighty 2 past Newcastle and constantly produce goals of the season
Fucking Norwich Hell no
I think he meant Lyon Marseille and maybe Lille and PSG
What are you talking about We had to sell Gameiro Nullifying our chances of european victory forever
Kind of off topic but what the hell happened to Lyon They used to be a top team in Europe and roll Ligue 1 year after year and now they are bottom of their group in the CL behind powerhouses like Zenit and Gent and haven t won the league since 2008
Lyon had a formidable upcoming in the mid 2000 s Very well managed They started making good money and saved it Then they for some unexplained reason they splashed all of their cash on Kader Keita 2007 16 Million Ederson 2008 14 million Jean II Makoun 2008 14 million John Mensah 2008 9 million Michel Bastos 2009 18 million Yoann Gourcuff 2010 26 5 million Pretty much every single one of them was a flop Then they decided it was the perfect time to build a stadium BOOOM
All you need to know
This is a good perspective but really only addresses the past couple seasons I m wondering more why they went from historically dominant in the mid 2000 s to where they are now Certainly the rise of PSG and their unlimited funds has something to do with it in the most recent seasons but they were falling from glory even before that for some reason They won 7 straight titles from 2002 2008 which is pretty amazing
they are bulding their own stadium so their last big transfert 30m was hm gourcuf in 2010 but he fails with injurys less than 30 full games played in 5 five years since 2011 they are only on young players and own formation lacazet fekir grenier gonallon martial but sold to monaco like arsenal did during many years
But we went to finish second in the ligue with 8 of our starter being formed at the club Lopes Umiti Gonalons Ferri Tolisso Grenier Lacazette Fekir If only we could form more defender instead of buying shitty player for 8 millions But guess they don t sell for the same amount so are not worth
They started overpaying for average players That s what shocked me the most And when talks about FFP began they decided to invest on a new stadium which will be finished soon Meanwhile they mostly had to rely on their academy players Ligue 1 s lack of attractivity didn t help them As well as the rise of Bordeaux and Lille

Interesting read
PSG have been able to sleepwalk through the league so far Even their bad performances have been mostly unpunished This is more indicative of the exodus in talent this year I don t expect it to stay this way next season
Yeah especially since many PSG players will play this summer You could see last season that PSG poor start was due to the players being tired and injury proned after the World Cup While OM players looked very very strong physically
Remember when they lost to Caen last year Good days
Owww you
I surely do inb4 it happens again
It s like when I play FIFA Career Mode on intermediate
Can t get away from the viral Bernie Sanders marketing anywhere on this site
Reddit has to do it because no one else will Hillary will probably win the nomination pretty easily in the real world she is much more recognizable Not that I would mind Sanders as president but this site is it s own little bubble You would have thought Ron Paul was going to be president last time this was the only place you read about American politics
I was just having a good natured pop at our old troubling but useful friend Modern Capitalism
First time I ve been on Reddit for Months and live in a Red State Bernie is pretty popular Favorite to win the Democratic nomination No At this point he is more than a dark horse However will young people get out to vote in the primaries History says probably not
PSG seem like they really need Ronaldo next season
How s that
It was sarcastic There s a lot of speculation over Ronaldo going to PSG and clearly PSG seem to be doing fine without one of the best players on the planet
I believe he s referring to how Real Madrid are starting to play worse with him on the pitch than if someone else who is younger and not nursing a chronic knee injury would be playing
Lyon won Ligue 1 7 times back to back this is nothing
Without having a Qatari daddy And we never steamrolled it
Without having a Qatari daddy Hmm Lyon went public Stock market daddy Also let s not forget OL Coiffure and OL Taxi

well that s ligue 1 we re talking about
This is a really cool stat fact
Noice
Inb4 PSG is ruining the league
You fucking are though Like seriously I like that you re playing well in Europe but watching the league is a fucking chore with your Qatari whores ruining the integrity of football
Your club did the same for 7 years though And you used to buy the best players from Ligue 1 thus weakening the league
Oh yeah totally similar situations Aulas is some foreign prince that injected a shitload of money in the club There s a difference between strategic presidents and sugar daddies
Precisely situations are not the same Lyon bought the best players from other Ligue 1 teams to secure their 1rst spot every year PSG brings in international stars which increases the TV rights on par with Germany can you imagine which makes more money for Lyon and the other clubs PSG does have shitload of money It doesn t mean this money isn t used as wisely as it can be QSI s strategy is pretty neat if you ask me Aulas is the best president in France It doesn t mean he didn t make big mistakes that cost a lot to OL Cissoko 15M remember
Lyon bought the best players from other Ligue 1 teams to secure their 1rst spot every year You re saying that as if it was easy and we just overspent everbody else they wanted to come here because they believed in what Aulas was creating most of them at least because had we ended up getting Pauleta or Drogba we d probably have a CL Budget wise PSG and Marseille were close to us Nowadays PSG spend 5 times more than anybody else that s not comparable We bought Essien Malouda and Abidal when they were unproven outside of France to Bastia Guimgamp and Lille not really contenders back then Paris buys Ibra Di Maria D Luis Cavani Thiago Silva just the same right We dominated because other big clubs were badly ran now the other big clubs don t even have a chance
Yeah you have some good points Although I think Aulas didn t really want Pauleta he just wanted to destabilize PSG back then by offering him a lot of money Essien Malouda and Abidal are good examples Shame you couldn t capitalize on the successes of this policy who knows what your budget would be like today Instead Aulas started overpaying for average players He was also unlukcy with Gourcuff Ofcourse with all this money PSG is supposed to lead the league But this thread is about those 13 points between PSG and Lyon This shows more about how the other big clubs are underperforming And honestly Marseille and even Lyon since a few years are badly run too
How are we badly run We had to trim the salary bill a lot starting around 2011 to pay for the new stadium so Aulas gambled on going young and we have finished 4 3 5 2 in those rebuilding years now we re back to regular spending We ll see if we can consistently play the CL now
Mostly the choice of players and the money spent to bring them since a few years including this summer with the exception of the very last few seasons when you pretty much entirely relied on your youth system You save money for years and you splash it out to bring it Beauvue and Valbuena Brilliant choice Glad if you re satisfied with that
Don t forget about Yanga Mbiwa He cost them around 10M if I m not mistaken
So one bad transfer window analyzed after 4 months makes a club badly run K Also splash it out Under 10M combined so David Luiz s left arm That s making it rain
Strong but fair Like a tackle from Puyol
Except the fact that Lyon havent exactly beng doing well in the league have they Lyon dont play PSG every week so cant blame them there same goes to all the other teams Last year Lyon finished 8 points behind PSG in the league with monaco only 4 points behind Lyon That seems like a pretty normal league standing doesnt it Same thing happened with Chelsea last season City finished 8 behind them Would you say Chelsea are ruining the league This Fuck PSG they are ruining the french league circle jerk needs to fuck off Everyone under PSG is under performing compared to last season and thats not PSG s fault is it Monaco have spent a shit load to get to where they are and no one complains about them
Paris under performed a lot in the league last year and they still had 8 points over a team which surprinsingly over performed
So its their fault Got it When Chelsea went undefeated for a massive amount of time last year were they ruining the league The teams under PSG are dropping a lot of points and Lyon has only 7 wins from 14 games Thats half of their games have been dropped points and they are 2nd Like I said just because the rest of the league is under performing isn t PSG s fault Bayern Munich have been very solid in recent years are they ruining the Bundesliga
Why are you bringing up Chelsea and Bayern The point is when a team overwhelmingly dominates financially every other member of the league it s playing in there s obviously no surprise on who s going to win It s like Juve s year in Serie B every other team knew they weren t playing for first place So yeah in a sense you can argue that it s ruining the league because even on match day 1 there s no suspense on who will end up winning
Im bringing up Chelsea and Bayern because they are relatively similar to PSG Bayern have been dominating the bundesliga for years but no one crys about them do they Do they say they are ruining the league What about Chelsea they were undefeated for a good portion of last year and were unchallenged really and have spent a lot compared to other teams but once again no one says they ruin the league So whats with all the PSG hate Ligue 1 teams under PSG are under poerforming and you cant deny that even though you dont mention it at all You can talk about PSG ruining the league but Monaco spent a shit load of money to get to where they are now and like I said just because you spend money doesnt guarantee success you guys were 8 points from them last year and were on top at one point so what there What about when Atletico Madrid won the league They arent exactly even financially when it comes to Madrid Barca are they I dont know where the circle jerk came from but there are so many teams that the same could be said about but PSG seems to get all the shit
Decades of success domestic and European got Bayern there There are about 4 5 different teams in England with financial means comparable to Chelsea s so it s competitive PSG has no competition in the league and got there because some guys decided to invest hundreds of millions in a club How is that fair estimate by Le Parisien of clubs operating budget for this season They spend as much as the next 4 combined how am I supposed to believe we or anybody else can compete
They spend as much as the next 4 combined how am I supposed to believe we or anybody else can compete Because you came within 8 points of them last year Even so it still doesnt explain dropping points in half of your games this year you cant blame you being 11 points behind on PSG you guys are playing poorly Also Man City and Chelsea spend considerably more than other teams bar united but they arent succesful in recent years so its not really competitive between 4 teams then is it
This is inevitably what happens when one team in a league has ambitions to step up to compete at elite level and gets the funds to do so CL has severely distorted national leagues in the last 10 years Even if Lyon or OM were performing as expected they still would be unable to maintain over the course of a season i e look at 14 15 So I can totally see the point of people getting angry about this when it is clear that no other team has the means to challenge
They don t have more ambitions they have a fuckload more money than us
Yeah wanting to win the Champions League and building bit by bit a squad capable of doing it that s not ambition at all
Where did I not say that I hate ambition arguments that fans of massive clubs use to blame other teams for a lack of competition I just meant it s what is to be expected when one team is chosen by the Arabian oil gods to get rich and challenge at a continental level The owners don t give a fuck about the domestic league
You know that s not true if Fournier had any ambitions you wouldn t finish 4th of group H against Valencia Zenit Gent Yes the lack of money is an issue but it s not the only one Ligue 1 teams have recently 5 years underperformed in European Competitions Now PSG became a rich club in Ligue 1 with mostly foreign players and reach quarter finals every year If we had more than 3 French players in the starting squad I don t think we would go far in CL Lyon did poor investments during their mercato You were unlucky to loose F kir but a club can t rely only on one player You kept an average manager who hasn t any European competitions experience I don t see any ambitions at all when I see Lyon picking ex Marseille average footballers or the 2nd choice from Serie A PL
You kept an average manager Who finished second in his first season after taking a team that finished fifth the previous season And you are the epitome of a PSG fan Oh so poor investments why didn t you buy Neymar or Boateng You can afford that We buy fucking second string Serie A and PL players because it s the best we can afford This isn t fucking Football Manager where we can buy some kid from Brazil and expect miracles this is real life I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us
why didn t you buy Neymar or Boateng We buy fucking second string Serie A and PL players because it s the best we can afford Kader Keita 2007 16 Million Ederson 2008 14 million Jean II Makoun 2008 14 million John Mensah 2008 9 million Michel Bastos 2009 18 million Yoann Gourcuff 2010 26 5 million You are the epitome of a OL fan Arrogant pretentious and ignorant T es vraiment un gros gros mais alors un gros de chez gros blaireau toi
come on guys hug it out um marchons marchons
I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us I don t see that happening anytime soon
I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us And then Ligue 1 can go the way of the Eredivisie or the Brasileiro Sure routinely losing your best footballers as soon as they show the slightest bit of potential will hurt the league more than the investment QSI has brought tv package comparable to Germany and not too far off Spain benefiting everyone but at least PSG won t have a lot of money
can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us What a great comment
Woeful league save Zlatan and get him out of there A S A P
That s the most inaccurate comment on Ligue 1 I ve ever seen in here
It s difficult to make any accurate comment when you are being overwhelmed by hormones I mean give the poor guy a break suddenly becoming pubescent is a very unsettling thing in someone s life
Ok without us Ligue 1 Arsenal would be a shit club but whatever
To be fair so would many teams in the Premier League
Especially Newca oh they re already shit
Another flop in the CL and PSG will surely start to lose their financial backing French football is abysmal
French football is abysmal but I m not sure PSG have really flopped in the CL in the past few years We got trampled by Barcelona last year but well who didn t
The year before that they lost to us on away goals and the year before it was Barca also on away goals Hardly flops pretty unlucky in all honesty
Boring leagueModric s first goal from inside the box with Madrid
luka modric scores me wipes away tear with one hand and fist pumps with the other while silently mouthing my boy
He s just a player that s hard to hate It s crazy to think that If he didn t score that wonder goal vs Manchester Utd a few years ago that he probably would have been sold
My bae
Watching modric score is like watching an angel get its wings
was this his first goal inside the box for real madrid
yes
was the keeper under arrest
Just got my Modric kit in the mail yesterday perfect timing His tempo today was great very good linkup and forward pressing
Lukas first goal in over a year
Fuckin finaly He has so amazing shot and he just never uses it for some reason
Gorgeous finish
Modrulja is best D
Why wasn t that initial pass to Ronaldo offsides Isn t he well past the last defender

I mean it s either assist or no assist right So yeah not gonna be 33 each
He will never be without detractors no matter what he does When you reach the level he has reached you re gonna be under a damn microscope for everything you do I do not envy that sort of pressurePogba is killing us here
Pogba has been going off this game
If people think that was a foul just never watch football again If you can t have those battles then football is a lost cause Otamendi just got beat
Think he was trying too hard to get a foul called
Hard to say from this particular clip to be fair
LOL at Otamendi 2nd awful error against Juve
pretty garbage positioning and looked outmuscled by mandzukic of all people for much of the game
Actually outmuscling defenders and beating them physically in the air and on the ground is an area Mandzukic excels in So it shouldn t come as a surprise that he of all people gives center backs trouble in those situations
I don t see much of Mandzukic so you may be right that he punches above his weight but Ota was totally out of position and will need to do better Mandzukic is smaller than most EPL strikers
6 4 is small for a PL striker nowadays
Google says 6 2 and 185 pounds He s slightly bigger than I thought but shouldn t be outmuscling Otamendi
And Otamendi is 6 and 180 pounds
No but compared to Neymar and Messi and Suarez and Dybala and Aguero he s definitely a stronger striker of all people Strikers aren t usually known for being massive punishers
But center backs are expected to be strong Mandzukic has 5 pounds on suarez who is the same size as otamendi He just ain t that big
Centrebacks are supposed to be strong yeah Everyone s agreeing with you there The reason you re getting downvoted by people is because you used the phrase of all people which implies that Mandzukic is weak compared to other strikers Yeah he might struggle to outstrengthen a lot of center backs but compared to other strikers he ain t weak
The whole game he was getting outmuscled ref bailed him out most of the time though
I really didn t see why he gave half the fouls I cracked up when he gave that last foul against Marchisio still don t get what the ref was thinking XD
That run from Pogba
65 metres according to the french broadcast I was watching
Fuck I forgot about this game why the hell am I watching PSG
Weak defending but cracking cross
Pogba and Sandro have been playing so well recently
Otamendi one of the strongest defenders around complaining about that contact is just laughable
i ve watched every city game he s played and haven t seen anything to suggest he s one of the strongest defenders around or did you not mean physically strong
Not sure if it was a foul by Mandzukic or not but the skill by Pogba and cross by Sandro were both excellent
Could have possibly been a foul but you ve got to expect your center back to be stronger than that
Heh that s exactly what the commentators just said
Does that mean I should be getting paid for this
Can t be worse than the clowns commentating now
Anyone have Pogba s drop on De Bruyne
So happy to see super Mario score
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot to me he s been the best player of the first half Now I just wish Khedira can stay healthy and keep Sturaro off the field
Sturaro was pretty damn good today He recovered so many balls
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot He has been for a while but Allegri is attached to Evra for his consistency and alleged defensive superiority
Pogba running like a gazelle
Great cross Mandatory comment about the coefficient
I think this is the third consecutive assist for Sandro Evra s been good but this guy is just better
what a cross from Sandro
Love Sandro I wish we could have attempted to get him He s been one of the most complete young left backs for a while
Funny that he underperformed in the last season here
Yes Indeed the young man is an excellent footballer
does Pogba ever celebrate
Beautiful cross in Deserved the goal
And sadly Sandro is always on the bench
Doubt he ll be there much from now on though
He got subbed off today to his second consecutive standing ovation from our fans He s definitely making a great case for himself and there s no doubt in my mind that he ll feature quite regularly from now on
great assists 2 games in a row also very solid in defense he s fighting for it
looked quite a bit like Baba s pass to Oscar yesterday Lovely ball
That cross couldn t have been more perfect
Pogba has been amazing so far in this match hoping he scores
I love how quickly goals appear on here
Alex Sandro s cross had eyes
The defense of De Bruyne on Pogba was just horrible He put himself between the ball and the sideline instead of the ball and the door
Great cross What happened to the defender there though
Otamendi choked hard
Mogo si se bacit na glavu
Yyyyyyeeesssss Way to step up mandzukic
What a cross
Makes me miss Darke for world cup games
Vintage poacher Mandzukic
Does Otamendi think he is Ronaldo
Great cross from pogba sandrp pogba is looking good so far in this match
Pogba didn t cross it The commentator even said Alex Sandro as he crossed the ball
Ohh corrected it thanks

You are what your record says you are Mahatma Ghandi
If you think I ve been unfair in mocking the Blues here s a neutral version to share with your Chelsea supporting friends https drive google com file d 0B ZcVoqtapgRNC1kT1RvbEZSYUk view usp sharing edit to add ugh does not display well in Sheets You ll have to use Excel
Hadn t planned on it but it should be easy Only problem is I don t know which supporters to pick on in other leagues p
If you beat Spurs this week I ll eat my hat Unrelated note I wear pizza as headgear
In isolation yeah catch any one of the teams ahead of you is plausible Catching all 11 of the teams in between Chelsea and 4th place well This seems beyond your grasp though I also give up p
This I agree with If the cups go toward the big fish Chelsea may well nick the EL Or if they win a cup themselves
Now that s a hot take
A lot of time and matches remain and Spurs still are a Harry Kane ACL away from a serious problem don t count your cockerels before they hatch
spits in hand offers to shake
The math nerds Ok Michael Caley and whoever does stats com put 4th on around 66 points the average is around 68 There s a lot of compression at the top since the appointed breakaway pack some subset of United City and or Arsenal has thus far refused to breakaway Plus also the computers are positively glitchy about Leicester They still have a lot of but it s Leicester in the model The models tend to weigh the previous seasons results and lessens it over time as the current season s results are factored in Frankly I don t trust the models regarding 4th place so I m inclined to agree with you If Leicester is s posed to be lower on the table that means that they points they do have have taken away from the other top clubs Gross oversimplifcation just happened So maybe we ll see a lower 4th place point total For reference the lowest in the 20 team era is 60 and the highest is 79
I ll take that bet if Chelsea do make the top 4 I ll eat a very spicy taco
I ll take a bet on either if you want
Or to put the Chelsea question in isolation What is your over under on total points for Chelsea this season
We ll see I like Everton to go on a tear I haven t watch enough Southampton to rule out a run and yeah West Ham is probably at their highwater mark If I were a betting man I d take the following clubs to finish higher than Chelsea Arsenal Man City Man United Spurs Liverpool Everton and yes Leicester Which four of those am I wrong on p And I have a newsflash Chelsea s not winning on Sunday p
It matters a lot because Chelsea is not the only candidate to make a huge run from the middlebottom of the table Everton looks good Liverpool looks good Southampton is well they may or may not come good it s hard to tell It does Chelsea no good to go on a massive run and achieve 68 points if 4th place is now 70 because someone got a hot hand 68 is not the finish line it s just a statistical point where half the 4th place team finished ahead of it kind of You are betting on Leicester falling back AND Spurs AND Everton AND Southampton AND Liverpool AND even the Hammers sure why not all dropping so many more points while Chelsea performs at last year s level suddenly and without any sort of reason to believe other than well belief I mean support your club and all but well yeah
Some other interesting things besides Chelsea p The bar gets even lower if 6th or even 7th are in the mix if the cups fall to high placed teams then the doors are open for Europa Everyone thinks Leicester will fall back to earth but I still like them for Europe Yes they have a daunting run to finish the front half but that just means they also have 13 matches reversed fixtures in their future where they glorped up 28 points on the first pass If they have another 25 28 points in them plus a few more around 7 9 from murderers row they can make 63 And if the top finishers get the cups they won t even need that many Leicester on Thursday nights What a world From West Ham to around Stoke if any of those teams go on a surge they are suddenly in play for nicking the last CL or the top EL spot It s wide open a few unexpected wins here or there Aston Villa are in deep shit DEEEEP shit They have 5 points in 13 matches 0 38 ppm They need to be more than 3 times better to get their nose into clean air I wonder what the lowest points after 13 matches that didn t get relegated was
Which is why I included the 80 target The math nerds on twitter agree that the champ this season might not make 80 whoever they are
I had that in but I dropped it maybe I should in future editions
Man City had one team to catch That team stumbled and City ran them down Chelsea has to eclipse 11 teams of 14 teams to claim fourth Sure they have almost 4 times as long to catch them as City did United but it s just too many clubs Plus they ve shown nothing on the pitch thus far that indicates there are a hair from making the switch from 1ppm to more than 2 1 ppm
I think it s sort of mad to consider it but if Chelsea can average 2 1 points per match for the rest of the way they ll have earned it no doubt
HHHHRRRGGGGAAAAHHHHH Oh sorry had a nightmare there for a second
I want Dembele with Dier maybe not as dynamic going forward although I think he s starting to get the value of passing forward p but Dembele is as smooth as butter on the ball and denying Chelsea a whiff of any takeaways up the pitch is quite valuable On Sunday I prefer Hugo Kyle Toby Jan Danny Mousa Eric Erik Christian Heung Min Harry It s not as dynamic as other options but it s stone cold hard defensively with enough up front to get the requisite 2 goals
Bah they were better than Norwich and Maccabi Tel Aviv Forgive me if Chelsea squashing bugs doesn t exactly fill me with dread When they ve played teams with some talent lately Loss to Stoke Loss to Liverpool Loss to Stoke on pens Loss to West Ham During that same span they got a win and a draw against Dinamo Kiev scoring a grand total of one goalibrahimovic substitution

They sold their best players while offering new expansive contracts to average players and they built a new expansive stadium who is not profitable
Pique would have done the calma calma then the siiiiiiii celebration and then he would have spent the last minutes with his right hand opened to show the manita
CamaradonaAhh thanks Your connection helped me find this The use of grass as British slang for a police informer dates back to the 1930s and is apparently a short form of the slang term grasshopper meaning the same thing Grasshopper itself is rhyming slang for either copper i e a police officer or shopper one who shops sells information to the police
You can hover over a crest to see the team name
It s no surprise that Sandro getting more regular minutes has coincided with Mandzukic looking more dangerous He could prove to be an important striker for us this season
What does grass mean when used in this context
Omar s version including Pogba wrecking De Bruyne https streamable com 774n
Unfortunately not
Probably his best performance of the season
The people who say that are those who have only seen the Vines
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot He has been for a while but Allegri is attached to Evra for his consistency and alleged defensive superiority
That was headed for the corner flag
Oh come on put this game to bed already
Lo stile Juve
Bit selfish from Morata there He did the hard work but if he passes to Dybala there the game is over And right off the back if that Sterling nearly scores at the other end
To be fair he doesn t need to work on his attacking game too much to reach Gattuso s level
On loan though your point still stands
Yep we play it after every goal at home
It was
Sounds like it s the only game you ve ever seen
Morata nearly gifted them a goalscoring opportunity there
Come on Mandzu
Haha can t blame you for trying Barza
DYBALAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Oh my god so not true I just want to translate a recent interview with him so all of you deluded haters can leave him alone He done no wrong
As a Norwegian seeing this it really does hurt my feelings He is a good kid one of the most mature 16 year olds i have ever seen Rumors on rumors on the wages and now this I d wish he would call in to a press conference to just debunk all rumors and tell everyone to leave him alone so he can develope himself as a footballer and as a human alone

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsBeating Barca and Madrid was about the only noteworthy thing they did this season They ve been poor in the league too
saw today how good they can be What you mean go down by 4 goals Conceeding 3 goals in 10 minutes is much more indictative about how bad Madrid s defense is rather than how good Shakhtar is Especially considering the fact that Madrid have conceeded 10 goals in their last 3 games
That s becasue the whole league was affected by the war
Or maybe how the players are affected by the war You think it s a coincidence how many Brazilians are leaving the team They re afaird for a reason you know They had to fucking move stadiums and the club s owners are running out of cash to support the teams
I mentioned Ronaldo because the guy I was replying to talked about Ronaldo
lol Portugal and Netherlands
A win by BATE could send them through the R16 IMO Roma and Bayer have been shockingly poor this year I expected a lot better from them
I m not pinning it on anybody
Mate this is against a team in a war torn country He has dissappeared in all the big games this year Atletico Sevilla PSG Barca
lol these English commentators Sagna clearly got Dybala on the foot
Well upon future research it appears they went to Budapest instead of Bucharest and the final was in Bucharest Other than that it s true
If they re gonna rotate then why even start Ronaldo He needs the rest the most
I remember when this huge group of Athletic fans flew to Bucharest for the EL final Except that the final was in Budapest
all that means is that Bayern is a team full of chokers
UEFALONA

Holy shit Barca s wage structure is out of control I really hope that Iniesta is the second dot and not Neymar or else we re gonna be in big trouble in thre coming years
Who s the outlier for United I know for Barca it s probably Messi Neymar and for Madrid it s Ronaldo but who s earning that much for United Rooney
Isn t Ribery still injured
Yeah just support Columbus then If you re looking for an European team just pick some team from the top leagues Spain Germany England Spain is perfect because the kickoff times aren t so damn early in the morning Go research stuff on Wikipedia and watch some La Liga games to decide Laola1 tv has free streams if you can get a German IP

Always round up with the exception of stoppage time where it would be for example 45 1 If a goal is scored 15 01 into the game that is in the 16th minute

Right but why is a counter strike pro playing football
Akinfeev is having a bad day
Akinfeev s trying to restore Sch rrles confidence huh
I hope he does He s one of those players who I inexplicably like even though I ve never supported any of his clubs nor his country
It s that perfect aryan thing isn t it
Those blue eyes show me all the could be pure in this world
Ty Akinfeev
That wasn t even a shot he was trying to settle it
I kind of wish we still had him
No you don t He has been dreadful
He just seems like a nice guy And I had hopes he could come good for us after his bad spell
We definitely do He was our only attacking midfielder that actually made runs in behind the defence and had a strikers instinst And he was an excellent finisher
The tense of this comment is bothering me more than it should
Why It s fine
He edited it It was in present tense
thank you based wolfsburg
looks a bit like his goal against PSG happy for him
Looks similar to the Torres goal he assisted vs Bayern
a bit but the bounces for torres s goal was higher

What has Rabiot s mom been feeding him lately
https twitter com Ibra official status 669493486056513536
Alves has had five great months of play in the past two years terrible from 2013 to mid January 2015 then he played to a world class level going into the Copa Am rica and his defending has been bad this season Only reason why he is still at Bar a is because they couldn t sign anyone else otherwise he would have left in January
cba watching the rest of this game i literally just saw Kobe brick an open fadeaway with 4 22 left in the third quarter and then Ezeli scored an alley oop 9 seconds later
Hibbert GOAT rim protector
honestly Kobe is being forced to take so many bad shots so many bad misses but the Lakers are AIDS
i assume this guy is in uni which means it definitely will take longer than 15 minutes the problem is that in most cases you have to absorb and analyze a lot of information and when you are limited to 450 words it s difficult to be concise whilst covering all the bases recently i had a business law assignment which was worth 20 of my grade it could only be 500 words it s difficult to really cut down from 750 words to 500 without losing key aspects of your arguments
Chuck is laughing but in his head he s like wtf bruh
GSW are going to win by 60
Kobe drops at least 30 points condition he isn t injured at any time Lakers win if i m wrong i ll buy you gold for one month if i m right you buy me gold for the next three months which one of you will take me up on this once in a lifetime offer edit 6 3

Ohhhh ya beauty its Flamini
OH MAN WHAT A GOALSo much room for activities
This is so bizzare it almost looks like a sabotage I can t believe manager would set them up like this
To make a point that the BBCJK can t all play
Exactly Its either a sabotage by Benitez so Perez stops interfering with tactics or its a sabotage by the players to get Benitez sacked Otherwise there s just no way any top team uses such a bad formation Even the most casual fan would notice something is terribly wrong
Bale Benzema Cristiano James Kroos
Aye
Did you hear about their line up in the game against Sevilla CDPRNMCKIBC
I find it hard to believe he did that s one strategy for taking the midfield battle out of the game s
That is some Moyes level failure right there
Surrendering the midfield from the start Bold move Let s see how it works for them Oh right Well then
Its perfect for Barca
This hurts to look at Still baffled how we went from an organized defensive team to that Sure its against the best team in the world right now but what a poor performance and utter lack of focus and organization Hope we can do better at the camp nou
Describing Madrid s formation
I can t understand how when real is attacking in possession Ronaldo Benzema and sometimes a third player are all within a radius of 4m of each other When on top of the above there is no one between the forwards and midfield defenders lines I am surprised they can still score as many goals as they do In fact they were already doing this last year with Ancelotti and Rafa just made it worse

Hmmm who s that new Hennessey player must be a new Wels oh
You can t give creative players that much space
You cant give Stoke that much space
Exactly That wouldn t fly even in lower divisions
I didn t watch the game but this is just a snapshot isn t it I cant see that the team remained in that shape all game Surely
A team should never stand like that against a top tier team
aahh the good ol charcoal formation
Shoutout to Hennessy for the graphic
If I recall correctly in the early chapters of Tsubasa their rivals did this strat and it was effective I dont know what went wrong there
It reminds me of how we would sometimes end up looking under Moyes
poor benitez he came to italy and totally forgot how to football
Ah the classic 4 2 4 wide formation with Kroos and Modric as CBs
James such a good midfielder though right
He is He was one of the few players that were somewhat carrying real
I mean Barca were going to dominate the midfield anyway In some ways it is a good idea to not waste players by trying to compete with them in there
Because they re good you decide to give them more space
Modric Kroos James
How long will barcelona fans drag this out
About as long as that gap in your midfield
bravo just bravo
Great keeper
Had probably his best performance for Barca yet
I refuse to take anything seriously a Liverpool supporter says
Yes because the fact that he supports a lesser team than yours means his opinion doesn t matter
Bet you have lots of friends

You just didI hope we will see a worthy clash between barca and bayern at their best
i don t think bayern will ever have robben and ribery on the pitch together again but those 2 being on the pitch might not even be their best team at this point
Costa is better than Ribery anyway
No he s not This is such a stupid thing to say
Not that I necessarily agree with him but Costa has been amazing
yeah but Robbery is a nightmare to play against
R bben is better
No Robbery is better because they steal points And in hindsight 49M total for that striking power is a steal too
of course he is He has been playing just as good as prime Ribery since he got to Bayern Current Ribery wouldn t get off the bench with Costa on his current form
just as good as prime Ribery What s it like having a memory span of one year
It proves that right now Costa appears to be the more productive choice Ribery has lost a step it happens to all players eventually
Ribery has lost a step Ribery was absolutely bonkers last season And no one knows if he lost a step because of his current injury He will return soon Maybe already in 3 weeks
The point I m debating was that as of yet Costa is not better than Ribery in his prime Perhaps better than Ribery now
Ribery has never had this much impact in his career
Had 7 assists and 5 goals in the small handful of matches he actually played last season Bundesliga specifically You have to be trolling
Cool random stats
Oh god please leave
that s my point everyone was pissed that bayern were missing ribery and robben against barca now it doesn t matter
Well Robben is important they are much more dangerous with him Ribery isn t
this would be amazing
There s not much between both teams just now Barca have been excellent for a few matches but Bayern have been consistently excellent At the same time it feels like Barcelona have done their homework and ironed out their early season problems The extra motivation might give Bayern the edge too after Barcelona beat them last year
and then there s the fucking almighty augsburg

Verstehe ich nicht was meinst damit
It s a popular song from an old german kids theatre from Augsburg that was very popular in the TV and it s the goal song of the FC Augsburg We also don t give a wimpel before the game but a puppet from that theatre Lovely club that one
Been to the puppenkiste museum last year after going to the christmas market Had to rewatch Urmel aus dem Eis and Bill Bo after that
I went three years ago with my little brother my then still alive grandmother and my mother Damn that was a lovely day was so close to buy a fully fledged Jim the Lokf hrer puppet for 70 And the only time I have seen a professional footballer was Bobadilla a fewe weeks later getting drunk on the christmas market Good times I miss that city so much
Every time there s a discussion about Augsburg on this subreddit or r borussiadortmund I can count on you being there Why did you leave
Why did I leave what
Augsburg You talk about it so fondly that I m curious about what led to you moving away
I finished my bachelors the masters there was not for me and most people that made that place what it was for me left So I wanted to see how much I like other places Turns out that I wasn t imagening it when I thought that those four years where the best time I will ever have And I will always remember it fondly Maybe even move back there one day who knows Augsburg shouldn T go below second league though that s a requiremend
Jim Button and Lukas the Train Conductor to be precise
Wtf were we doing
Should ve never won that game to begin with

Everyone has to visit the dentist
And no one enjoys it Except for Augsburg
Well Augsburg did lose in the last minute so they might not have enjoyed it that much
The dentist was nice to them for the whole trip and then he just ripped out the tooth They were definitely in pain
We didn t enjoy the wrong penalty call But we enjoyed the match
I m with you on that Hate winning that way would ve rather taken a draw against The Parked Buss of Augsburg
Just wait until Mainz makes Bayern look like a bunch of amateurs yet again
Like they often do Fucking Mainz
I dont know much of the german league why other teams are not even close is about resources why is Bayern in a different league than the rest of the teams
Bayern right now would comfortably whoop every other league aside from La Liga They have a gulf of talent across world football not just their own league
Bayern are not all that much better than the top teams in spain england italy or psg ON THEIR DAY The thing is that bayern are so consistent comparatively They have been making far fewer mistakes than the other top teams in europe
Consistency is what seperates the best from the rest Arsenal can beat Bayern on their day and we do but we d get battered 4 times out of 6
Correct That it what i just said
And I m just pointing out why that makes them much better than the top teams in England Italy PSG
Fair enough i guess i just thought i portrayed that when i said ON THEIR DAY We agree then Consistency separates them Cheers
Yeah ressources Bayern can compete with the best because of ridiculously good marketing TV money is a joke compared to Spain or even England I would wager that Suarez Neymar and Messi make more money than all of Borussia Dortmund first eleven combined
There s not much TV money spread around the league but Bayern has done well to market to supporters globally that other teams haven t gotten close to Having an amazingly consistent success rate in recent years and having some of the most famous NT players certainly helps the appeal Bayern also has been incredible well managed and received consistent growth where other German clubs squandered their potential in the past Lastly once Bayern solidified their place in the top clubs worldwide the income was solidified as well causing further gap in the BL
Holy mother of fuck
Their home record in the CL is even more impressing
Pep likes his funky formations
And that s why I hope that if we meet Madrid or Barca in the CL before the final it will be a home game first as opposed to an away game
Why where there 24 more seats on the first 2 matches
Corporate boxes probably
Curious to see if they can keep it up when Europe s elite come visiting
Barcelona Arsenal Dortmund
When did they meet Barca this season And Arsenal and Dortmund aren t part of Europe s elite anymore
Hey now
Dortmund especially this season are better than most teams in the CL regardless it d be deluded to say otherwise
Might get far in the EL true
Oh whoops I thought I was on the post about our last 9 home CL games
Yeah Well to be honest neither is Ajax if Arsenal is not sorry I actually love Ajax
Ajax hasn t been part of the European elite for nearly 15 years now maybe longer Money talks
For me Ajax is not in European elite this season But they are usually I usually have high expectations from Ajax because I love Ajax very merry much
he s right they haven t been a mighty European side for a long time last time they got to QF of UCL is 2002 03
Yeah I know I still do not want to admit it

I think he meant that Bayern are so good that no other teams can match them But its the same circle jerk bullshit that people are taking shit about PSG and as a Celtic fan I hear it plenty too
Don t see what that has to do with his comment

Deutsch ist manchmal auch in Deutschland selbst eine schwere Sprache Immer weiter so
Aktuell schwer Wird sich aber auch bei mir wieder legen liegt wohl daran dass ich vor einigen Monaten selbst in Paris war und die Dinge die ich dort als sch n in Erinnerung habe jetzt einen dunklen Unterton bekommen Es ist nicht wirklich Angst im eigentlichen Sinne sondern viel mehr Wut und Trauer
Krass Find s halt brutal wie der Terror jetzt auch Deutschland erreicht Vor allem so wie du s erz hlst Ich hab mich aber auch brutalst mit dem Thema auseinander gesetzt Der Mensch f hlt sich halt zu dem was ihn ver ngstigt hingezogen Darum hab ich viel zu viel ber Paris gelesen und auch gesehen
Wie geht s euch eigentlich so nach den Paris Anschl gen und der Evakuierung in Hannover Habt ihr Angst Ehrlich gesagt w rde ich l gen wenn ich sagen w rde dass das alles bei mir nichts ausl st Versp re schon etwas Angst um da mal bei der Wahrheit zu bleiben Andererseits sollte man sich solidarisch und die Terroristen nicht gewinnen lassen aber das f llt mir aktuell schwer

Pique would have done the calma calma then the siiiiiiii celebration and then he would have spent the last minutes with his right hand opened to show the manita
CamaradonaSorry man I know you want to praise your defender but if Sterling put that on target either to Buffon s left or right that would have gone in It was a terrible miss from Sterling no defending could have saved you there

Felix Brych is such a terrible referee woeful calls all across the game Edit Every fucking year as well God fucking damnit
What A Goal
Anybody have any idea what s going on with Hart
Feeling a red card coming The players are getting fed up with it all
Unable to go back since I m relying on other people s streams Normally I would be able to go back into the match to grab that for you but now tonight Sorry mate

Maybe try selecting a role for him in that position that s what I do So instead of CM Playing position select CM Central Midfielder That s what I do when I want to re train my player and it seems to help
He s still at United in 2018 in my save Getting decent amount of apps but not a key player United did buy Kane in their first season so they play him instead
Getting no yellows is pretty difficult thing to do Your players will make tactical fouls and or lose their head and make rash challenges It s pretty much impossible to not get carded at least once in a game
Can I see your squad I m currently playing with Gent and I m only in 2018 so I m still struggling a bit
Get Zabaleta
HOLY SHIT BOYS THEY DID IT Belgium is proud of you
Pretty fucking stupid that two four steps are guarded
That first minute red card though
Probably Pardew
Fuck I didn t get Bolasie s skill that lost him the ball in itreally interesting read I didn t know about van Gaal breaking his leg
I love how he done it
That s somehow so very van Gaal to suddenly take up pole vaulting as a hobby
Great article Thanks for sharing
Injuries suck so much
Grear read funny to see all of the coindicences
TIL
Season cut Shaw t Fucking excellent hahaShame he wasted his career winning everything with Barcelona he could have taken us to Championship glory
He would certainly have added strength to our sub s bench
Sure he d have got into a midfield of Nicky Bailey and Kevin Thompson
He never proved himself in the Champ but neither did Kev who was always injured Bailey was alright Robson was the real guy to displace
Always had a soft spot for Tarmo Kink Should ve kept him just for advertising Parmo s
Loved Kink remember him scoring a double against Burnley shortly after we got him very decent player
I fucking love it when Estonian players get praise
The Estonian Exocet What a left foot Shame he was so incredibly hit or miss
Mate he s the Tallin Torpedo Remember one match after he scored his first screamer for the club he came on in the last few minutes literally everyone in the stands was saying he would fire one in from range What did he go and do fire one in from range
Thomson is a quality player would have done a lot if not for horrible injuries
Spent his career at a team who couldn t even dream of winning the Football League Championship Shame indeed
Heres some quotes from the article that this article is referencing Xavi is a genuine football fanatic I interview players all the time You and Jamie Carragher are the biggest football addicts I have met I met Carragher on a beach in Ibiza when we were on holiday What did you talk about Football He s a good guy a fanatic You can see that He came back to Spain to interview me I bet I could ask you about lower level teams in Spain and you d know Ibiza from the second division Ibiza are now in the third Barakaldo a tiny Basque team with a beautiful stadium They re leader of one of the four Segunda B leagues Look shows his phone I read about all the leagues every day Alaves Near the top of the second Gaizka Toquero has got five goals so far Huesca Near the bottom of the second Regional fourth division club San Andreu Mid table Started well I have friends at these clubs I follow how they do Cornella who play next to Espanyol is another I follow the Belgian second division because there are players from the Aspire Academy there What about lower level English football I follow Middlesbrough because Aitor Karanka is there Brighton are top of their league I met a boy the other day English He was wearing a Barca shirt but I asked him who he supported He said Sheffield United I know them they have 20 000 fans in the third division That s incredible You get that in England I watched some of a game with Charlton the other day There was football on television yet the stadium was packed with supporters Incredible If that was in Catalonia Olot vs Reus then there were would be a few people there and the families of the players Heres a link to the full article
Xavi s wife must be so fed up with him
well actually When I have time I d love to do the same but I think my wife would kill me Can you imagine OK you stay with the baby for three days while I go and watch Liverpool against Everton
haha he said it because he talked about Luis Enrique before he became a trainer that he used to go and watch teams and he used to wear a scarf so he was not recognized
that sounds awesome wish i had the money to travel around europe watching all the best derbies out there
Didn t he break up with his previous girlfriend and basically say well at least I can finally watch all the football I want
Xavi didn t date anyone for a while in order to be free from distraction and focus on football
Xavi and Carra seem like such an unusual combination Hopefully they both find their way into management at some point
Imagine carra trying out a bit of Spanish with a scouse accent
Me yamo carra
Sounds good to me
I ve heard it It s not so bad The real odd one was a very strong Welsh accent combined with near fluent Spanish of the Spain variety It was quite odd To be fair both were better than Chileans haha
You re basically describing what Angel Rangel is going to be like at the end of his career
Joint managers of Catalunya
El Clasico 2035 Xavi in charge of Barca vs Carragher in charge of Madrid
So knowledgeable What a guy imagine he ends up coaching Middlesborough
i m not sure my heart could take the pride
Holy shit how does he have so much time to follow all these leagues amazing Can t wait to see him training Barca some day I hope Lucho stays until Xavi arrives
What else does he have to do Footbalers are usually free most if the day after they finish training
I mean I imagine that after a long day of doing nothing but playing thinking about football and fitness you might want to do something non football related Like go mushroom hunting
It sounds like he just looks at the tables and reads articles
Yes I watch a lot of football Madrid are very strong this season They have a different philosophy to Barca They work a lot on their defence Rafa Benitez has improved that snigger
What s the Aspire Academy
Qatari football factory Foreigners go in NT players come out
That s by far the best definition for it African and Asian players training to make it into the 2022 Qatari NT
Football academy in Qatar where Xavi is studying
Best football academy in Qatar IIRC
I m Mallorquin and I didnt even know Ibiza got relegated
What a legend I miss him so much
That is such an incredible interview I wish there would be more revealing interviews like this where we get to read about player s experience in historical events and their insights towards football in general and certain players in particular
Brighton are top of their league INCORRECT Clearly Xavi knows nothing about football
they Sheffield Utd have 20 000 fans in the third division That s incredible You get that in England I watched some of a game with Charlton the other day There was football on television yet the stadium was packed with supporters Incredible If that was in Catalonia Olot vs Reus then there were would be a few people there and the families of the players How can anybody say English football has no identity
huh who said that
Vicente Del Bosque
Totally out of context He wasn t talking about the fans at all He was talking about the English way of playing football vs the Italian Spanish insert any country here s way of playing football And he s right Those times when you could recognize the nationality of a team by the way they played is over Take Arsenal and Chelsea for instance Totally opposite ways of playing yet in the same league There s no English Spanish or Italian identity in terms of playing anymore or at least that identity is getting much more vague
Take Barcelona and Atleti and you have the same disparity in play style
Absolutely yes Which is precisely my point
Pretty sure he was talking about the style teams play with when he said that
In what context
He s a cretin
What a glory hunter
Dags and Red or nuffin m8
Xavi should come help us out so those 20k fan aren t pissed because we lose 4 2 at home to fucking Shrewsbury Town Fuck
Big Nigel s doing a fantastic job
Curse of the Nigels To be fair it can t just be him We ve got a massive squad full of crap bought for a lot of money Our entire behind the scenes finance board is very opaque so no one has any idea who s actually making the final decisions on stuff I m pretty depressed seeing you lot doing so well too Football s pretty shit right now
What s happening with McGahey
Sent on loan to Tranmere God knows why our whole defence is shit might as well give him a try
What about Che Adams and Louis Reed Your squad is full of young talent sorry if I m kind of rubbing it in at the moment
Adams got injured and is finding his feet again Reed was one of the offenders last night got subbed at half time Both are really talented though Reed seems to have become a bit too relied upon for my liking though it s a fair bit of pressure for him especially when the others in midfield aren t playing well
Xavi s just trying to get in the next Sean Bean movie
LORD OF THE GRASS
Not surprised to hear him say this always thought he had his head screwed on right
He would have been dead proud of United s fans last night singing your not fit to wear the shirt 40 minutes in
The Lane s not the happiest at the moment
I can understand why you would have been promoted by now if you kept Danny Wilson
I was behind Wilson got some unnecessary stick off the fans C est la vie
Will be even more impressive next season when we re drawing 20k in the fourth division
The more I read about Xavi the more I like him He seems like such a nice guy
He is a genuine football fanatic follows third division teams all over the world I can t wait until he coaches his first team I think it s inevitable that he will become a coach
let s hope so his football brain is immense
Which is crazy to think how smart Lahm must be then Pep worked with both and made a huge point how smart Lahm was
Let s hope he successfully managed a first division team
Obviously I hope he coaches Barca one day
Mhm I m just nervous cause sometimes highly successful ex players turned managers due fairly poorly
He seems nice a good leader but from what I ve seen he also seems like a sore loser
Ferguson always scouted for the sorest of sore losers they were the ones that fought the hardest on the field
you re really determined not to find fault in Xavi lol
heh not really I m just trying to point out that for many football players their biggest asset is that they are sore losers
Except even among the realm of top class footballers Xavi is noticed as being a sore loser So it cant be that
So is Mourinho So is Ronaldo Are you saying this because of the grass length comments he d make
Not that nice a guy https www reddit com r soccer comments 3bfwxk xavi qatar has conditions for great world cup
I m just saying if someone gave me millions I too would blindly praise them for everything
yeah but you probably aren t already a multi millionair
But they can get good infrastructure due to money
Really He s said and done a lot of things recently to put me off him
really s top lad
What a football nerrrrrrd one of us
I m sure he writes for Zonal Marking under a pseudonym
Why is Xavi such a cool guy
Xavi is the ultimate hipster
Would he be impressed by this blavdes fan https twitter com Oddschanger status 669531006769213441
Xavi is a fantastic player and genuine football fanatic but I must say the whole Qatar ambassador thing is very disappointing and on the same note Barcelona s Qatar Airways deal is quite depressing as well
Have to think that Juninho and Ravenelli had something to do with that
Great Another what Xavi said post
Too much Xavi last days
Xavi to Middlesbrough confirmed
Mate he wouldn t make it into our midfield
Who needs Xavi with Big Grant bossing it
Banned for Huddersfield though isn t he I suppose we can arrange a tryout deal for this Xavi guy
Oh no you ll really struggle to beat us now s
Poor man s Adam Clayton
Fuck it we ll have him
Middlesborough Never heard of them Except something about a tragedy involving Liverpool fans
Oh you re painfully American I get it
What
Wow you re thick as fuck
Jesus fucking christ
HillsboroughReally After what they did on Roberto and Rafinha
Out of curiosity do you follow the Turkish football in general and or support a team in Super Lig as your second team to Atleti
Messi vs Manchester City
Some fake ass bromance IMO
I d go as far as say that even Arbeloa would be a better replacement for Carvajal if the latter can t play for some reason than Danilo Porto are laughing their asses of for robbing Madrid 30M

Much credit to Bale for Cristiano s goal
Guys how s Kovacic been so far in this game
Kovacic himself said he s much better as a DM than as a offensiv midfielder higher up on the field Don t really think he ll be a success in the game

Wake me up the day Cristiano do the same for BaleHe s back guys He didn t rapidly decline die or some other shit He s okay
He didn t want to score till Messi started scoring
I miss Messi its not fair if hes out injured and I keep scoring Ill just lay low for a bit until he s back
The Kneejerk is real
He was briefly less than superhuman but even that was scary enough for him to get back to form
He obviously did decline but since the last game found the fountain of youth He s getting better so must have reversed the ageing process it s the only explanation I mean that maybe a few bad games happens to everyone and just because you re over 29 doesn t mean a few bad games means the end of your career
I still think he s declining

He d have about 6 inches of height over him that s not even a debate
Messi is 5 7 Cr7 is 6 1 6 inches your math checks out
he s the all time top scorer in the champions league without penalties most goals in a season is also his without penalties i imagine there could be at least one more but those two i m rather positive about

Bayern or Barcelona the one with the less injuries

They usually use words that actually have relevance to what the stat is about But motivated seems like it was just randomly chosen
Not really in the news today it was reported he d promised to work harder etc in the team meeting after the Clasico so obviously they are going with the idea that Real are extra motivated for today s game after Saturday s embarrassment
Only Benzema Ozil and Di Maria have assisted Cristiano more than Bale

Reports of his demise have been greatly exaggerated
Mate this is against a team in a war torn country He has dissappeared in all the big games this year Atletico Sevilla PSG Barca
what the hell does war torn have to do with it You realize that the game today was played in Lviv a city on the complete opposite end of the country from where the conflict is taking place right Ukraine is a very big country It s not like they had to worry about bombs being dropped on the stadium It s amazing how far people go to discredit Ronaldo s achievements
Or maybe how the players are affected by the war You think it s a coincidence how many Brazilians are leaving the team They re afaird for a reason you know They had to fucking move stadiums and the club s owners are running out of cash to support the teams
It didnt affect them in the Ukrainian league they have only dropped something like 2 points since August
That s becasue the whole league was affected by the war

I think you are being ignorant and unfair towards Shakhtar They are extremely strong at home and its incredibly difficult to beat them Many big teams in last few years have been unable to do that And we saw that today how good they can be
saw today how good they can be What you mean go down by 4 goals Conceeding 3 goals in 10 minutes is much more indictative about how bad Madrid s defense is rather than how good Shakhtar is Especially considering the fact that Madrid have conceeded 10 goals in their last 3 games
Doesn t change the fact that shakhtar are good at home
so did the team don t pin it on one player
He s not pinning it on one player Ronaldo played shit in all of those games not talking about the rest of the team
Ronaldo played shit but so did Bale Kroos Ramos Benzema etc are they all fastly declining too
No because you don t usually decline as a 26 27 year old top level player Ronaldo is nearly 31 and when he plays bad he essentially isn t there
what does age have to do with it if anything it s his knee problem that has limited his dribbling compared to the past but Ronaldo didn t go from scoring 66 goals and getting 22 assists last season to becoming useless this season in the space of 3 months even when he is playing like shit he can still give chances for teammates and create space for others with his movement just because he isn t dribbling past multiple players it doesn t mean he isn t doing anything useful the only problem this season has been that he is isolated as striker and his finishing has been bad also factor that his teammates have been invisible in most big matches too
Age has a lot to do with it come on I know that Ronaldo is a crazy fit guy but sooner rather than later later his physicality will decline Also 61 goals and 21 assists Also Declining being useless ffs It means he s not playing to his standards He s been realtively worse even in his worse form than he was before
yes in 2 or 3 years he will no longer be RM quality but as of now he is definitely good enough to make a difference in any match as long as everyone around him doesn t disappear like against Sevilla and Barca I get what you re trying to say though but it came across as you calling him useless in the original comment by saying essentially isn t there
15 goals in 17 games this season while having a short run of his worst form in years Not to mention the entire team has been playing like crap and there have been an endless amount of injuries Must be tough to life up to your peoples standards
How many games has he scored in And name the teams Ronaldo plays well when the whole team plays well and sometimes he plays bad when the team aren t up to it
15 goals in 17 games is still a record 99 of players want to have at the top level
I m not pinning it on anybody
He has dissappeared in all the big games You re making it sound like his team is playing great but he s letting them down or some shit
I mentioned Ronaldo because the guy I was replying to talked about Ronaldo
they are actually in some damn good form if you actually take into consideration their form but hey fuck that
deleted
I think i understand that part doesn t change the fact that they re playing very good
the boy is growing up
Eh Wrong I think I seem to remember him getting 2 assists away at Schalke in 2014

I hope we do renew his contract Best destroyer in the world
does he even play that much
He s still a starter although he doesn t play midfield under Pep
He did yesterday I hope it becomes more routine It probably will considering Boateng Benatia and Badstuber are all healthy
It will I think a lot of the stuff the fans see Pep also sees It s why I like him He knows what needs to be done and he does it He s smart about it though He doesn t rush into things He wants to make sure that the players are all healthy before he makes moves again He moved Lahm to RB and he ll move Martinez to CDM again Martinez is regaining confidence though When he first came back he was definitely not ready to play in the midfield He looked afraid to dribble He ll get there though
Typically Bayern managers have fallen into two archetypes pragmatic and not idealistic idealistic and not pragmatic Not to say I don t appreciate them but Klinsmann and Van Gaal fell into the former while Rehhaggel Trappatoni Hitzfeld fell into the latter In his last stint Heynckes was the first manager in a long time to maintain a sense of style whilst tweaking the philosophy to achieve the best results The more you look at Heynckes career as a player and a manager the more remarkable it becomes and I ve never even been a zealous admirer of him He went from stubborn Osram to a man who adapted and changed at an old age That kind of transformation is seen rarely in anyone especially not one as decorated as him And I think Pep has really taken cues from that Yes Guardiola is highly intelligent and he wants to win more than anything But let s be real here he s always been an idealist and it s hard to imagine him ever abandoning a possession system and playing like stoke But it s year 3 and he is still constantly modifying his starting XI and tactics because a for rotation and b because he knows that the best results have not been achieved yet and he ll keep searching for the best tactic for his team I hope he signs that fucking contract or imma kill him
Well that took a dark turn at the end
How s Badstuber doing these days
He just got back from injury got subbed in against Stuttgart two weeks ago Was in the starting XI against Olympiacos yesterday and got a red card Not really a justified red card in my opinion but I m biased so you gotta decide for yourself
Just got back from injury
Didn t get to watch the second half how d he look in midfield
Couldn t really tell the match wasn t hard at all so he got to coast pretty much
He s no2 CB with Boateng And plays over Benatia
Benatia and him rotate although he s recently been starting more often over him probably due to form injury issues I guess you can say they re kinda joint starters it s just that neither of them is clear cut above the other Kinda like MaTS and Bravo at Barca except Javi and Benatia aren t exclusively alternated between the league and the cup
And Badstuber is still injured Who will move on first
Badstuber played yesterday Not the entire game though since he got a red after an hour
since he got a red after an hour I like to call that one a substitution with a handicap to even the playing field
Ya to be honest though it was a fitness problem with Badstuber He wasn t as fast as he should have been and the guy went down and he got sent off
Badstuber was never fast
it s just that neither of them is clear cut above the other I d say Martinez is easily a cut above Benatia which doesnt come as a surprise because the latter didn t have much chance to play with the team for a longer period without injuries
It s hard to say Bayern haven t had four fit CBs for more than a handful of games under Pep and its usually closer to two Between Benatia Badstuber and Martinez it s usually a safe bet that 1 2 of them are injured at any given time At the start of this season all three were actually injured and Boateng played the entire defense himself and in one game was subbed out leaving just Xabi to cover the entire back line The most you can say is that Boateng is a permanent fixture His partner or two depending on whether it s a 3 or 4 man backline varies a lot He could be paired with any of the three other CBs or even Alaba and Rafinha who sometimes play as makeshift CBs too Pep is all about that flexibility
They have to keep him he was insanely good when they won the CL Just needs to stay healthy for a while
If they could start him in the midfield that would be greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
Yeah I would so love to see a midfield of Martinez Vidal Thiago
Pep please
more like Thagio please
Bist du besoffen Deine komplette comment history schaut so aus als ob ein 14 j hriger dies alles geschrieben h tte
Der ist leider immer so
I can t even imagine the conniption Athletic fans have whenever they pop on a Bayern CL match to check in on Javi and he s chilling in his own half with Boateng
chilling in his own half with Boateng Dude have you seen our matches lately The only one chilling in our half is Neuer and even that just barely
that vocabulary tho
Is conniption not like a word people use
I mean my friends think I have a huge vocabulary and it s not something I ve ever uttered I meant it as a compliment haha Edit unless you re being sarcastic and I missed it
It s a common enough word in Ireland it means hissy fit
Also common in West Virginia Irish immigrants maybe
Chilling in the centre circle you mean CB have to stay in the other half under Pep or no chocolate
Javi was among the main reasons why we won the CL His presence in midfield was nothing short of staggering It was as if there were three of him Edit Yes please
He has to get back in midfield Simple as that
I love you Javi
Come to Arsenal please
Every thread yada yada
It s cool just throw me a downvote
You can t have all the playmakers and cdms in world gooners
not having any dms is one of the main things that s been fucking them the last few years tbf
He would be a dream signingGeorge Best top 10 goals according to some dude on youtube
in 2 his running dribbling style looks so alike to Messi P S anyone notice Mr Bean s car
The change of pace is amazing Also your flair is amazing
Thank you
Pat Jennings save at the start as well Us Northern Irelander s should have done more with those two surely
Worse teams have won more with worse players See Denmark 92 and Greece 04
Some of the tackles flying in are brutal
Goal number 10 was nuts Half of the players today would still be rolling if that had happened them
So many long balls

I feel like those first few goals would have been rated much higher had they been in color
Obligatory George Best quotes If you d given me the choice of going out and beating four men and smashing a goal in from thirty yards against Liverpool or going to bed with Miss World it would have been a difficult choice Luckily I had both I spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered I used to go missing a lot Miss Canada Miss United Kingdom Miss World In 1969 I gave up women and alcohol it was the worst 20 minutes of my life On the pizza gate incident between Manchester United and Arsenal That s what children do throw food That s not fighting We were real men We d have chinned them On having blood transfusion after a liver transplant I was in for 10 hours and had 40 pints beating my previous record by 20 minutes I used to dream about taking the ball round the keeper stopping it on the line and then getting on my hands and knees and heading it into the net When I scored against Benfica in the 1968 European Cup final I nearly did it I left the keeper for dead but then I chickened out I might have given the boss a heart attack On Eric Cantona I d give all the Champagne I ve ever drunk to be playing alongside him in a big European match at Old Trafford On Cristiano Ronaldo There have been a few players described as the new George Best over the years but this is the first time it s been a compliment to me And my favourite now They ll forget all the rubbish when I ve gone and they ll remember the football If only one person thinks I m the best player in the world that s good enough for me
And of course George Best was the greatest player in the world Pele
The Pele comparison one anyone remembers In which he would say somewhere along the lines of if he is not that beautiful then he would have achieved more than Pele
This one I think If I had been born ugly you would have never heard of Pel
Yeah look like this But I don t think this is the exact wordings
Is that Ronaldo one true He could only have seen Ronaldo in his first couple of years at United way before he looked like he d become a truly world class player
There are some videos of Ronaldo s first couple of seasons 2014 Ronaldo could be as effective as 2004 Ronaldo with 1 3 of the trickery but you never knew exactly what 2004 Ronaldo would do Edit At least once he d finished his stepovers
I had the once in a lifetime chance to play against George Best and some other UK footballers in 1976 I lived in Torrance California and played youth football since 1966 at the local parks and then in the AYSO I went to High School with Sigi Schmid and Marine Cano ex goalkeeper for TB Rowdies and in 1976 I was at El Camino College in Torrance using the weight room facilities on a Saturday morning in February I was in training for a shot at a berth in the 76 Olympics but in another sport when a friend sees me and knowing I played soccer came into the weight room and told me there was a pick up game on the football practice field and they were looking for more players I was going to decline but then he told me that Rod Stewart was there so off I headed It wasn t just Rod Stewart but also Elton John and and some other expats playing with some other English expats and a good part of the LA Aztec team Pre Season was just around the corner and everybody was trying get the poundage off But I was young and really really fit and was outrunning every body most of the English players I think that year the Aztecs has like a 20 23 man roster and 17 of them were from the UK I hadn t played any organized soccer in 3 years and just kicked around with friends over a year ago but as soon as the rust fell off and I got my feet from under me I started playing better good enough to be asked to come back as a practice player Many NASL teams had unsigned player they had practice with I has to sign some kind of waiver but in turn they paid for a medical insurance policy for me and all training players I played for about 4 5 weekends and a few weekdays before I had to leave for more specialty training in my own sport I remember after I left Terry Fisher the coach of the Aztecs asked about me When I came back from the overseas later that year I was told the Georgie had opened a bar called Besties in Hermosa Beach by the pier on Hermosa Ave When I walked in he was BEHIND the bar LOL but he even remembered me called me a gddam idjet mucker and gave me a pint George was his best customer and he would often take a stack of bar business cards walk down to the beach and pier and hand them out to every good looking bird in a bikini for a free drink and he never cared if they were legal age or not If they were pretty they deserved at least a beer NONE of these girls knew who he was but about 3 out of four a took up the offer and the bar was always filled with birds and also bird watcher who ended up buying a lot of drinks that kept the bar afloat He had an apartment on the beach about a block away George never drove especially in the US but always had someone drive home As drunk as he sometimes got he was usually at every practice on time He really loved football and a hangover was no excuse One of my most prized possessions was an old photo I had taken with me and my girlfriend with Rod Stewart Elton John and George Best I never made the Olympic Team but I did graduate from college and went on to work in Washington DC for an agency that is called now The National Geo Spatial Intelligence Agency and when I moved back to DC I found out my soon to be ex girlfriend had poached that picture along with two T shirts we got from a Battle of the Bands at Redondo Beach Veterans Park of a band we played against called Mammoth as the pimply faced lead guitarist gave to us because he thought my girlfriend was hot Mammoth may not ring a bell but I m sure the name they took later Van Halen would But even though the Tshirts and photos were lost the memories will never be and they sound even better when you talk about your Glory Days But I ll never forget George Best that g ddam idjet mucker for the rest of my days
Time to post this atrocity Awful defending awful commentary static offside line referee wearing the number 8 for some reason it s like a parallel universe
How many times are they going to say the word soccer
Greatest saahker goal I ve ever seen
sigh not much has changed
Those were dark times
Before the Empire
I ll forgive it all because there s cheerleaders American cheerleaders they re they re just great
They look like they re having seizures or throwing a temper tantrum NASL in 70s was a fucking joke
Its like when your dad would play keep away with you when you were a kid

The saying s much older than youtube
That was the banner that hung in Belfast during his funeral procession
Also it should never be forgotten that it is the tenth anniversary of the death of rallying legend Richard Burns FIFA and RBR it is for tonight
As if anyone needs an excuse for a bit of Richard Burns Rally
I m down
I had no idea You d have thought it would be everywhere here in Belfast with memorial stuff but nah nothing R I P Georgie
Yeah normally they are good at remembering things from the past over here at least we have the Airport
Hahahaha yeah
Well there s a mural of him over on Sandy Row You could call over in your hoops jersey and lay a wreath if you fancied it There was another one out East somewhere but that was painted over to be replaced by a paramilitary one which understandably kicked up a fuss
I well i know about the mural but you think you d have heard something today about it being the 10th anniversary
Im more surprised its only been 10 years Feels so long ago I think they still have a mural up the Cregagh near his childhood house
It s very strange seeing someone reddit referencing the Cregagh
It seems like weeks ago to me
I actually served him drinks in 88 while working at a club opposite Granada Studios He was making the show Best Marsh The Perfect Match and Tony Wilson brought them in for lunch
RIP George
Greatest player to come out of Ireland Most naturally gifted United player You can t teach or learn what Best could do
Isn t it funny how all the most shining eulogies in British football are reserved for players who burnt out early and became complete pissheads Best Le Tiss Gazza etc
I admit Le Tiss had his fair share of McDonalds but i ve never known of any allegation of Alcoholism on his part And maybe a bit bias but he had a pretty average length career retired at 33 due to injury Not exactly the hardest worker but putting him in that category seems a tad harsh
Judging by his Countdown appearances last month Le Tiss is doing fine and is a much smarter guy than anyone would have suspected
He was never an alcoholic but he used to get hammered most Saturday nights during his playing career I live in Southampton and every landlord club owner and taxi driver has got a story about Le Tiss on the piss
Just realized I don t know a term for drinking that rhymes with Le God
Moore Charlton Shearer Beckham BTW Le Tissier played regularly until he was 34
Also not British but from Ireland Paul McGrath can be added to that list Premier League PFA player of the year as a defender I don t think any other defender has managed that
McGrath is actually about as British as it gets He s from Ealing
I ll drink to that
It s funny because he died due to his crippling alcoholism
Yep his problem was so bad that he drank through 2 livers
from what I hear hard to stick to recovery when fans were willing to buy him drinks
In his autobiography the one published before he got his liver transplant Blessed I think it was he said that he tried some hypnotherapy style treatment which he claimed worked for several weeks for him Then when the press found out he was going to it he stopped going because he didn t want people hounding him when he went
Very similar to Paul Gascoigne
Don t die like me Reading Best s story kind of ended up helping me get something of a grip on my own crippling alcoholism Learning of his tragic decline from something mercurial and almost otherwordly to something like a useless tramp bumming around in strange leagues and causing scenes It motherfucking wants you dead or down and out and it doesn t give a shit about how fast smart or successful you are The end phases of death by alcoholism sounds so utterly demeaning disgusting and painful that the actual end sounds like a massive blessing
Fuck man Glad to hear you re doing well
And the tenth anniversary and one day since 24 hour drinking laws passed in the UK
Going on up to the spirit in the sky It s where I m gonna go when I die when I die and they lay me to rest I m gonna go on the piss with Georgie Best
Conversely the man was also an alcoholic wife beating scumbag who took multiple liver transplants that could have went to more deserving people Disgusted this city named our Airport after him too We have many more deserving people in our history Edit Kicking a ball around should not absolve a person from their sins irrespective if you support that club so downvote away Edit 2 United fans down voting as expected
yeah even Utd fans tend to ignore his later days with the club I remember watching a documentary which mentioned that in his last season with Utd he got so fed up with the team s performances that he went AWOL in the middle of the season and decided he d rather party than show up to matches Can you imagine if a famous modern footballer did that
What is Carlos Tevez
Shuck it Trebek
I ll take Football Traitors for 300 Alex
Didn t City ask allow him to take the leave though
for 6 months
Disgusted this city named our Airport after him too We have many more deserving people in our history He was a product of his times and had his demons Fair play he had a dark side but who else was any better The Eamonn Holmes city airport
CS Lewis John Stewart Bell Jocelyn Brunell Gary Moore
Wait so kicking a ball has less merit than playing a guitar
I see you opted not to pick the author or respected scientists Nice
Gary Moore
A man has never defined the Blues more aptly
Agreed I m no fan of the classic blues King Allman Clapton but there was something intense about Moore s style something unique
Equally we shouldnt forget him and denigrate his achievements because he wasnt a very nice man Alcohol addiction isnt something you can control the wife beating is obviously scummy but abusing people for being addicts seems a little harsh I didnt realise an airport was named after him I assume Belfast not Turin
Yeah Belfast
What s it with greatest footballers beating their women Messi will turn alright though i think
It s just stupid people from bad backgrounds who suddenly get the world handed to them on a platter and can t deal with it well
More acceptable back then
Correlates with substance abuse and addiction problems
If Messi started on his wife she could just put him back on his high chair
Even if Messi does get started with the whole domestic violence jag he s probably too small to do much damage no
Kicking a ball around Grow up will you There are few things more cringey than someone saying football is kicking a ball around as if it s that simple You re no better than these people on Facebook demanding that footballers swap their wages with soldiers As for Best s alcoholism and liver transplants that was his personal life This post is celebrating the footballer
You re no better than these people on Facebook demanding that footballers swap their wages with soldiers I love these its brilliant to see people trying to work out the economics of it and realising how fucking stupid it is
One brings joy and entertainment to the masses The other invades foreign nations on the whim of politicians FWIW I m not having a go at soldiers We all need to make a living but we can all stretch the logic to suit our arguments
It s fucking bullshit Its like my mother or my wife when united lose a big match It s just a game For better or worse people invest a huge part of themselves to this game Look at the faces of the fans when their team scores a an important goal What else brings that much extreme mixture of positive emotions fleeting as it might be Very fucking little
It s just a game must be the stupidest quote ever To them it may just be a game but the fans it means everything people often say men show no emotion but you look in the crowd after a team has been relegated won a cup and you ll see many emotions including grown men in tears
It s the same with any Maradona post But he beat his wife but but he s a cocaine addict but he he cheated by using drugs
With a friend currently on the transplant list who has barely drank a pint in his life fuck this guy not only do people like him take organs that other people deserve more high profile cases like his actually discourages people from signing up to be a donor
high profile cases like his actually discourages people from signing up to be a donor Is that true I just can t imagine people refusing to be donors because of cases of famous people being privileged
I d be amazed if this is the case
Not what I meant in the slightest an alcoholic who is famous meaning people who might have previously signed up to be an organ donor wouldn t do so one of the main reasons people use to not sign up is because they feel that there organs would go to alcoholics and drug addicts
Some might say alcoholics and drug addicts are victims of horrible crippling illnesses too
Seen children who had no choice in the slightest become ill and rely on donations to live hard to feel sympathy for somebody who bragged about the champagne lifestyle he had and caused other people to be discouraged from signing up to be donors because they don t want there organs going to alcoholics and drug addicts For what it s worth I think there is a vast difference between someone who homeless or has suffered abuse and has turned to substance than a rich and famous footballer
So a rich and famous footballer deserves no sympathy for being blighted by a horrible condition I m not one to pick and choose who I feel bad for The man died from this He s not sitting in some mansion somewhere lording it over his stockpile of livers And I agree he s no more deserving of a liver than someone else Perhaps less so because his illness wasn t just something that could be fixed with a new liver But if you were dying and were offered a liver would you really turn it down for someone more deserving You re a bigger man than me if you would
Hang on are you saying he should have turned it down Blame the system dont blame the guy for taking something available to him that could save his life
He got himself into that situation by drinking to excess and bragging about it whenever he could
I can t believe people are circlejerking his LOL I DRANK ALL DAH ALCHAHOL quotes from him after he had one of his fifty six liver transplants It s fucking pathetic Sure he s a good footballer but he sounds like he was an absolute tosspot
Whats worse was the actual real life circle jerk People in Belfast knew he was an alcoholic it was literally killing him yet they where busting their asses to buy the man a pint just so they could say they drunk with their hero Pathetic
Pretty much exactly the same happened with Alex Higgins Probably Gazza too
You can t fault them They re Irish
Yeah if he was Australian we d probably just take a photo with him outside the local prison
That was nice
They d probably classify themselves as either Irish or more than likely Northern Irish
The man was a first class prick I m glad his hedonistic lifestyle ended as it did but the repercussions can be felt on his family
ITT folk who ve been lucky enough never to have had to deal with addiction in their lives Talk is cheap lads
I think it s where you see the average age of the subreddit coming out Haven t had to deal with their own shit or haven t lost anybody to anything like alcoholism or drug addiction Ill people aren t arseholes they re ill
Bunch of absolute cunts Seemingly think that alcoholism is just loving the drink no self control Best was just a party animal Its being dependent on alcohol every second of every day And if one more person equates him going through two livers to stopping two people having transplants I ll swing for them The first liver was his fucking own he wasnt giving that away
I ll swing for them https pbs twimg com media CHFE EvWwAA2rpH jpg
Yeah addiction is a problem and it s hard to stop doing something you re addicted to But when you burn through 2 livers because you can t stop you re taking chances away from other people People who might ve lived a longer and more decent life Talk is cheap mate Just because he was good on the pitch doesn t mean he should be worshipped off it
One of the livers was his own tbf What is your solution Let him die Its not like it was a conscious decision to kill himself after the transplant he was an addict
I don t know if I have a solution But he shouldn t have been bragging about slugging pints while on medicine
If I had to choose between dribbling past 5 players and scoring from 40 yards at Anfield or shagging Miss World it d be a hard choice Thankfully I ve done both George Best
Proper legend
Dumb cunt didn t deserve liver transplants he got Because of him many people who actually deserved 2nd chances didn t get them
Helmet
He s right though
Alcohol addiction doesn t make him a dumb cunt though
Alcoholism is the only disease you can get yelled at for having
Just an Asshole
He s a prick for other reasons but being unable to control his alcoholism isn t one of them
Its like they think that people make conscious decisions to become addicts
Yeah don t think Besty really thought oh I ve just gone through a whole load of pain and been bedridden for months while slowly bringing myself closer and closer to death but I might just do it all over again just for a laugh Could be another one of those stories people tell about my banter
Not for alcoholism For the multiple liver transplant which could be used by other non scum people
And the liver transplants were brought on by his inability to control his addiction Not sure what point you re making
The point is that people who consistently relapse into alcohol abuse shouldn t receive transplants over other patients and should be pushed down lower in the waiting lists
No shit Poirot My point is that doesn t make Best an asshole He didn t relapse on purpose
To be even considered for a liver transplant a patient has to be fully responsible to keep it healthy It is pretty much like 2nd chance When they screen for possible candidates that is an extremely important category without it people don t get livers He got them because of his status and pissed it away An addict got a healthy liver over someone who actually was sick
Hmm I m starting to think he might have had some kind of addiction to the alcohol Almost as if he had no control of his drinking We should probably tell the authorites For now let s just call it alcoholism until they come up with a better name for it
He got them because of his status and pissed it away And died People are acting like Best got away with one His addictions killed him We should be pitiying him not abusing him Its these attitudes and misunderstandings of addiction that mean we dont treat them properly
So if he got the liver because of who he was and not because he was considered responsible enough to be sensible with alcohol post transplant why does that make him an asshole Surely it d be the people who made the decision My point doesn t change if that s the argument
If you re drinking is so bad that you need many livers it s probably time to go Also being in addiction doesn t desolve you from criticism There s nothing wrong with drinking and driving then it s just addiction
Haha what an incredible leap
Well 2 people didn t get second chances not sure how he d have stopped many people lol

Horrible analogy Proper analogy would be like if someone is fat because he has horrible eating habits and gets a heart replacement over someone who actually had a genetic heart condition and needed a heart Then proceeds to ruin his healthy heart by eating shitty food while a person with a heart condition dies from the wait
Rest in Peace Best but he wasted two Liver
My uncle Harry was his minder for a few years Says one morning they woke up in Glasgow had a match at Old Trafford that day Made it back to Manchester in time for the second half Scored a hat trick
Can t believe it s been 10 years I remember watching the funeral and looking over at my Dad as silent tears rolled down his face
oh
This thread should be a quote fest
14 min compilation https www youtube com watch v 2FhhhT27KM0
Nice there was some clips I had never seen before
Yeah it s a good compilation I reckon I even like the music I remembered this clip after searching for some clips of him a while back to see how great he was and this clip thoroughly convinced me
10 years already I remember watching his funeral on the TV Shame he practically retired at 25 due to drinking and partying
If only he had a tiny bit of professionalism he could have gone on to be a Man Utd legend like Wayne Rooney
The famously professional Wayne Rooney Would you say the same about Tony Adams
If Tony Adams had missed training to go and get pissed or if he retired because he didn t get his own way and threw a hissy fit about leaving the club then yes Just so happens he didn t do any of that but that arrogant cunt Best did
Must have missed a fair bit of training when he was in jail for two months having been convicted of drunk driving Alcoholism is a disease why does Adams get a pass where Best does not
Because Adams as a former Arsenal player is infallible apparently
Adams as a former Arsenal player didn t ruin two livers through being a pisshead cunt and didn t run away from training numerous times to aid that It s a case of someone who turned their life around and one nasty bastard who refused to
He did however drive drunk and admitted to playing games for Arsenal while pissed So he was a danger to others and put his career at risk Its a case of someone who turned their life around and someone who couldnt Do you think all addicts are just selfish
George Best drunk himself through multiple livers and into his deathbed Tony Adams beat his addiction and set up the sporting chance clinic to help fellow athletes beat their addictions
Continuing to drink after his liver transplant was stupid but it cost him his life Do you think he was doing it for a laugh because he just loved a party Alcoholism is a disease Adams should be lauded for beating it but Best shouldnt be abused for succumbing To criticise Best for allowing his alcoholism to affect his career and not Adams who missed months of a season and even played drunk is hypocritical
Stay classy buddy
Stay classy buddy How is he not being classy What the fuck does classy even mean in this sense You spoke ill of a footballer I like ergo you are not classy Typical vote pandering neckbeard babble
Maybe criticising someone in a thread about the anniversary of their death isn t a terribly nice thing to do
It s 100 serious I don t understand why Man Utd fans fall over themselves to laud Best who never wanted to play for them and missed training all the time to go get pissed yet slander a club legend like Rooney if he goes a couple of games without scoring
who never wanted to play for them You re speaking out of your arse Also no one s slandering Rooney He s their second highest goal scorer From what I can tell they merely want him benched
He has a point though Play to your best your entire career win countless accolades retire late on like Rooney and Lampard and you will be hated mercilessly mocked and ridiculed Burn out retire early and drink yourself half to death and the nation will love you for it We have a weird self loathing complex in English football where we hate the successful but eulogise the people who wasted their careers and talent
Yeah Lineker Shilton Shearer Beckham Scholes Neville etc are all hated Lets not pretend Rooney doesnt get a lot of warranted stick He s unprofessional he spends his summers drinking and smoking and he s twice threatened to walk out on United in order to get himself a bigger pay packet He s also not performed for England at a tournament in 10 years including letting us down badly in 2006 He s clearly been a fantastic player but that doesnt mean we have to love him

Pique would have done the calma calma then the siiiiiiii celebration and then he would have spent the last minutes with his right hand opened to show the manita
CamaradonaEverything is back to normal in r soccer now
Setanta commentator they ve been well almost perfect while Messi s been away And now they re em they re just perfect
Still no Pogba screamers
Not enough degaard updates either
And Diego Costa antics shaming
He just got someone sent off I don t think it will be long
Well there it is
Chelsea are winning games now though
It s truly miraculous how game in this situation is plural
Tis a Christmas miracle
Was Messi actually injured Jesus
Took time off to gather more Ki
Yeah he ran out of sensu beans earlier
He gave them to Suarez and Neymar actually He didn t need them
He s been doing intense meditation sessions with the Elder Kai and is now Mystic Messi
Spent a couple of episodes charging up his spirit bomb
Just took time off to become Super Messi God Super Messi
more Ki Seung yueng
He s going to for a Spirit bomb isn t he
Those three are just insane Mezmerizing
Messimerizing
Yeah something like that D
Messimaruazing
Messuaneymarising
That s actually one of the best team goals I ve ever seen
How do you even defend that Three players just absolutely tearing through the whole team
foul
lucas would have brought somebody down
Except he would have already been on a yellow and would have had to let him go
Classic
two fouls
People can t just go flying through the air like that Jackie
You don t That s when you shake your head and say Too good
You just can t They re doing this against Roma but they could do it to any side
They can only do it when the opposing team doesn t defend properly If they do track the runners you can stop moves like that Problem is they do it to you all game and eventually you have a lapse in concentration and they do this to you
Just takes one player s lapse in concentration for that breakdown The fact that Barca does this so frequently is what s scary
was thinking that I suppose the backline has to push up with impeccable timing but with passing that quick it s not gonna happen In fairness to Roma they look like they were trying not to sit too deep but that frontline is just too good
Foul hard enough to sit someone down on the build up
At the start of the clip Keita is man marking him After Messi lays the ball of he follows it when he didn t need to If he stays with him he can block his run Even after Keita lost him it was still stoppable When Messi lays the ball of the second time Maicon doesn t react to his run If he reacted earlier he would have easily dealt with the ball It s great play by Barca and they caused the mistakes but the goal was avoidable from Roma s perspective
If Keita had stayed with Messi then Neymar would ve passed to Suarez instead From there Suarez would have the ball with plenty of space Neymar and Messi to look up to and maybe even made a similar sort of run himself there s just endless possibilities so score when you ve got a team playing as good as Barca have been playing
track the runners instead of chasing the ball The RCB has didn t track the run of messi leading to the goal
The RB and CB tried he was just too quick for them
Football porn
It s reminiscent of Arsenal s goal vs Norwich Aka this one https www youtube com watch v wz EaTwqNII
Why the fuck did someone feel the need to play Coldplay over this
Apparently either Norwich or Arsenal used to rule the world
Just not as good as Arsenal s I might be biased
Biased but correct tbqh
staight from the most biased source of them all thanks
Nah that Norwich goal was beautiful
No definitely not as good but similar for sure
God I love soccer
That was better than porn imo
You can t just pay a young lady with big tits to deliver goals like this in the champions league
That s what you think
Maybe we should try
We do have the technology now
Like something straight out of a video game
I wish I could do that in Fifa
And that finish Pure art
Seriously how the fuck do you stop that Unreal
chop him down
MSN is finally back
You know what s unfair this is not even surprising anymore Those three are an exhibition
Seriously Watched this goal and was like oh wow that was nice but was upset that the ball was played over the top to Messi instead of a backheel I just want the buildup to go on forever because I know once he s through its over
Good guy Alves
Didn t pull a Nani
That still irritates me
Some say it still keeps Ronaldo up at night
That explains why he keeps moving further and further away from Ronaldo
That will always irritate me Nani ruined what would have been the greatest goal of Ronaldo s life Ronaldo beats both the greatest defender in the world at the time Pique then the greatest keeper of all time Casillas against who was the greatest team in the world at the time Spain All those things together and Nani invalidates the goal with his greed Infuriating To this day I think it was the greatest piece of football I ve ever seen of course enhanced by the fact that he beat both Pique and Casilllas I don t care how impressive a clip is if it s in the Ukranian league EDIT To everybody telling me Nani was onside I don t know if it was true I still see a lot of debate till today Ronaldo still argues that Nani was onside Here is the best screenshot I could get from a low fps clip you be the decider https gyazo com 6c13739c5292aab0594f73b8c685092f Ronaldo always seemed to be a good sport about it but onside or offside that ball was going over the line and I don t see why Nani couldn t shy away like Alves did to give his teammate his deserved goal
But it was a friendly Ronaldo should have done that in the weeks before when he was playing spain in the world cup
Does anybody have a clip of this
https youtu be j5gDJfFvObg
idk soccer what happened
The ball would have gone in the net and been a goal for Ronaldo but because Nani headed the ball in while being offsides there was no goal Edit got called offsides
We followed the guy Ronaldo completly outplay the defense of the opposing team and scoring a goal or so he thought At the last moment one of his teammates hits the ball but he s so far up he s off side thus cancelling the goal Ronaldo gets mad rightfully so i d say
Here you go
Nani was onside though no 3 I think Pique plays him on with his legs because he s lying down and even so Nani touched it after it passed the line
STUPID NANI CANCEL CRISTIANO RONALDO AMAZING GOAL NEW 2015
GONE SEXUAL
he was behind messi when he shot he ball he actually impeded the defenders clearance by being in front of him Woulda been called offside had he actually been offside
He is in ultra teamplayer mode today
Isn t he always
He is he rather passes the ball than score himself
Great restraint and he held off that last defender
Hahah it s just really bad defending right guys They can t really be that good Right Guys sobs
I instantly turned into arab football commentator what a beauty
Why arab Are they the same as those south americans that yell goooal for like a minute

Yababa ya baba
They don t stop talking for a second literally
No joke These guys talk incessantly for 90 minutes Every single action on the pitch is commentated
https youtu be XTpGw 7Y0as They sound hilarious
love the rhyming Arabic and French are becoming my favorite commentary languages
Actually the guy goes full poetry It s an Arabic thing
They re my favourite because they don t copyright their stuff so we can use it

Golaso is universal

My god this is one of the more fine goals I ve ever seen
If i dont see peak bayern and peak barcelona play each other this year i will be slightly angry
The passing the movement the Messi Perfection on a football pitch
Some fine Messi ing by Barcelona so far tonight
This is some performance Suicidally naive high press by Roma but Barcelona s passing and pressure is just beautiful Nigh unplayable
We ve made Messi a verb Pack it up boys
passing and movement are nouns as is Messi
As is life

MSN is back
aside from the possible risk of epilepsy good gif
You re looking for the word seizure Epilepsy is a disorder that usually includes symptoms like seizures
Thanks that is the word
Oh my
I regret nothing
He s Back
Let s face it at this moment Barca is just at a totally different level The set up of that goal is crazy and the finish Well its a Messi finish what else can be said
The assist for the goal was totally flithy I think that was from Suarez Such a deft touch
What a goal These guys are playing at an insane level nowadays
Holy shit
tiki taka level MSN
reminds me of Austrias team goal vs Liechtenstein this year http gfycat com GoodnaturedDistinctItalianbrownbear

Incredible goal my god
That was insanely good
Oh my what the fuck MSN That was honestly magical
Falque thought about appealing for offside for a second before deciding fuck it
Shit is not even fair jesus
Suarez can do anything
You know at this point you should really just foul them Maicon grab his shirt and pull him the fuck down So you ll get a yellow big deal But I guess it doesn t matter in the end because they gonna score some more anyway
He s baaaack
I love how people used to worry about how selfish Suarez and Neymar would play with Messi on the same pitch Jumped off my couch for this one

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsIs a player considered a one club man if he was loaned out early in his career
If Andros Townsend spends the rest of his career at tottenham it would be funny if he gets considered as a one club man after like 10 loans
No need to exaggerate only 9 loans
Yes Lahm was loaned to Stuttgart back in his early days if I recall correctly and he s still considered a one club man i m sure there are other examples it s just that I can t think of anyone else from the top of my head
John Terry also was loaned out but noone would really argue he isn t a one club man eitherGood man Had a season ticket at Cracovia when I studied out there Some season we re having Great to see Kapustka doing so well too
Lived in Hyde Park Burley Roundhay and Swarcliffe Never had a problem in any of them
Can the dog die May sound weird but me purchasing the game is highly dependant on this I don t want to let him down
Leeds have more points than that
There s a club on Elland Road just off Lowfields Road who could do with some new players at the moment Owner is a bit of a knob mind Could probably get a game
Just a normal Leeds fan he was active on a Leeds message board once upon a time Tackle was clean and just done for a laugh that s how Vinnie was

Can someone tell me exactly what these things are I need to accept I can t grow a beard I m also guessing you wouldn t recommend buying a cheap razor from eBay
Don t give a fuck about off the line clearances ten men etc It s an away win And with how we ve been playing I ll take it
Silvestri terrible for the goal which is a shame as his handling looked markedly better today Berardi positive on the ball but some mistakes such as passing Bamba erratic Cooper meh Taylor handled his winger well and got in behind once Dallas meh Adeyemi woeful Murphy positive on the ball dwelled a bit at times though Cook far too good for this team Wood did he win a header Antenucci hard worker always looks like he ll make something happen We need something different hopefully Botaka is it
I m just not sure why it takes us so bloody long to get going Dallas is great but only in the second half I d start Antenucci on the right over Byram He might say he doesn t want to but I don t think a player should dictate his terms to the manager He s a right footed player who is clearly comfortable cutting inside and shifting it onto his left He can definitely do a job there I d also like to see Murphy start over Mowatt
No worries I can see Inter having a good season Strengthened well and Juve s poor start will be a great motivator

Apparently they found a bomb in a truck which was disguised as a ambulance oustide the stadium
They planned to play the french anthem instead of the german one in the stadium
Don t use Hola It s up to some shady shit
Holy shit that may be the highest rated squad I ve ever seen You have a 91 rated Thiago on the bench ffs Nice job The presentation looks very nice too
Yes this is the area final Should have clarified that This is Fratton Park home stadium of Portsmouth
I won after penalties Every penalty went in until I finally saved their 8th shot And sorry for this stupid small screen GIF My first time recording my screen on PC and I didn t put FIFA in fullscreen because I didn t think it would like this if I didn t Ninja EDIT I m Portsmouth btw and was playing against Crawley Town against Legendary
No you could hear three explosions in the first half very loud in the stadium and broadcastExcept we can t beat Spurs Like ever
Neither can Swansea
yeah well
Zac would be a Swansea fan
because he s pretty but struggling of late
Same back at you With love not really Man Utd
I got your back bro
This year only one team has beaten Spurs Even United needed an OG to do it
Yep Here s a list of scorers of winning goals against Spurs in the prem this season Kyle Walker
Always rated him
Wenger did in fact almost sign him
United didn t beat Spurs Kyle Walker did
If Walker had not scored Rooney would have
Rooney looked like he had a bad case of buck fever in that instance Much like Kane did last Sunday
It s less fun when you think of it that way
To be fair the only reason Walker ended up scoring is because Rooney bottled it
Man of the match he was I was hoping he would hit top form that game too haha
And everyone can beat Villa
Almost everyone
sadly
I mean we ve beaten everyone else since our return Both us and Tottenham have had a mix of managers And yet no matter what we seem to do we just can t beat them I m not hopeful the December match this year either
We ll probably go 2 0 up but end as a draw
Maybe though you re apparently more confident in our team s ability to go 2 up against any team right now
I always get super nervous against Southampton since you guys are usually tearing it up at the time but for whatever reason we seem to pull the win or tie out of no where at times Usually great games though well at least in my biased opinion haha
I think two or three times in the last couple of season we ve been 2 0 up against you guys at half time then Christian Eriksen just decides to tear us apart in the second half and you guys win 3 2
Or that one season of Adebeyor going nuts in his first game back under Sherwood Basically his only bit of form in years and it gets him two goals against us
It was nice feeling the way Spurs might have felt when Elia went nuts and scored two away against Newcastle last season
Yeah fuck Newcastle and that Krul game
Yeah just go God mode for one game and all is well We d been on a good run against Newcastle at that point too
I think we seem to beat you and Swansea a lot as your good footballing sides like we are but also not quite as good as us So you don t sit deep you actually have a go at us That weird thing where you tend to struggle more against as worse side who are just happy to take a draw It s like how united used to just always beat us
This season it is definitely you doing the tearing up
tie Spotted the American
spoiler alert there s more than one
Wait non English people watch footy as well
Haha true I hadn t even noticed I actually usually do say draw interestingly enough

And we can t beat fucking Norwich such is life
Newcastle Norwich was 6 2 sorry to be that guy
FUCK
Sorry Love your work though
I preferred his earlier stuff it s too commercial now
Did you actually make this Saw it earlier on today on another site
These things get made around this time every year Someone else could ve made one as well
Well at least I didn t have to be that guy
That game broke my heart
That game partially mended mine only for it to be repeatedly shattered afterwards
Business as usual as a Newcastle supporter then
Should say where anybody can beat Chelsea
except Arsenal
And us
In fairness we can t beat anyone
Bournemouth
Oh do fuck off
Fuck injuries
After 13 games I m starting to think the only word to describe us is that we re Fucked
Chin up Tamworth is only 9 points from the top
You think you re special We lose every week
Looking forward to this weekend but will be sitting in the home end as the away end sold out
Actually says Where nobody can beat Leicester Except Arsenal
Not saying we would ve won but to be fair Mike Dean fucked us over e Lol no idea why I m in the negative now Hell I don t get r soccer sometimes the officiating that match was dreadful and even Chelsea fans can admit that
You guys always say that
Every team s fanbase blames the refs on a regular basis hardly an Arsenal exclusive phenomenon Did you even watch that match It was a very unusual case
I was joking I forgot how sensitive it gets in here sometimes I remember Mike Dean fucking over many teams to be fair I didn t catch that specific match but did see the outrage afterwards My cousin supports arsenal and after every loss he blames the ref no matter what It s quite funny
Your cousin must have hated you for joining Manchester United
Nah its all good he got him an Xbox
Yeah well
Never expected to see Dan s thumbs on r soccer
Is this from Ninja Sex Party

No this one NSFW
Isn t Juventus having a pretty poor start to their campaign as well
They started out absolutely abysmally Chelsea esque but have recently been kicking things up and are in the 6 spot after beating Milan last Saturday
Leicester have still only lost once and they went into the lead in that game mad
The best team they didn t lose to was Tottenham and they drew them The best team they ve beaten is West Ham 2 1 The next month will be telling for this team
Pretty good considering our defence let in 14 goals in the first 7 games Thank god for the rest of the team making us score
Like Liverpool 2013 14
But Leicester Could win the league
In fairness them being in the league doesn t add much as they where behind in a load of games Spurs have also only lost once
What about when not being fair
For La Liga 12 games played Sporting beat Malaga beat Deportivo beat Rayo beat Palmas beat Sociedad beat Sevilla beat Getafe beat Levante beat Villarreal beat Atletico beat Eibar beat Granada beat Bilbao beat Valencia beat Celta beat Barca beat Real beat Espanyol beat Betis beat Sporting There is nothing special about this specific cycle there are 3657 such cycles for La Liga Havent written code for EPL You can find the code here http pastebin com QdRvfwRv You will need to modify the arrays if you want it to work for the different leagues EDIT Coded it for EPL There are 144 such chains for EPL A different example for EPL Bournemouth beat West Ham beat Newcastle beat Norwich beat Swansea beat United beat Tottenham beat Sunderland beat Crystal Palace beat Liverpool beat City beat Everton beat West Brom beat Arsenal beat Leicester beat Watford beat Stoke beat Southampton beat Chelsea beat Aston Villa beat Bournemouth
without a circly picture I won t believe you
The circlier the truthier
Which is to say if anyone can beat anyone La Liga is more competitive
Yeah this means nothing Example circles for La Liga Serie A
Without pictured badges and fancy slogan I won t believe you
Damnit man I m a software engineer not a graphic designer
Not with that attitude
And now do Bundesli oh well Bayern
The Internet being the Internet
Graphviz
graphviz is where it s at
Damn right it is I don t usually get to see my computer science and football worlds intersect so neatly
La Liga Where anybody can beat anybody
And in all 144 Leicester will be next to Arsenal and Spurs will be next to ManU
The irony that this is more true for La Liga when this infographic was meant to defend the EPL s recent poor form in Europe is pretty funny
For what it s worth here s the version with the corrected scores http imgur com JzpajZe Edit Correcterer scores
Did you use an algorithm to find this path or was your work manual Edit I was bored so I spent a little bit of time writing a Java app to brute force it Here s all the combinations of which 144 exist at the moment They all start on Stoke but being circular you d get the same results ultimately no matter where you started Edit 2 OP s combination is on line 43 Edit 3 Tried to do the same for Bundesliga And well Can t because Bayern
Shouldn t be too hard to do manually it s quite closely defined by the fact that Villa and Bournemouth have only won one game each and Tottenham and Leicester have only lost one After that there aren t too many decisions to make
not to mention a better render of our logo good good good

the answer we were looking for was badge or crest
We all know what he meant but it s badge
Is it still a badge if there is no shield
Get ready for the Sport bible to steal this without credit
I remember this was the case during the 13 14 season as well and it turned into a very good season entertainment wise so hopefully it s the same here
It feels like this one has already started to top 13 14
It s shaping up quite similar 4 5 teams at the top of the table with only a couple of points separating them the champions faltering badly and a team at the bottom who everyone has nailed down as relegated but a new manager could bring some hope
Hope What s this magical hope you re talking of
He was talking about Chelsea
I don t know I m being nice to Villa it must be this damn Christmas spirit of mine
I hope some of our opposition have some Christmas spirit and gift us three points soon I m looking at you Watford
I hope Scrooge takes away your points for Christmas
You need a heart transplant for being nice to the Seals and a brain transplant for thinking they have a hope
Yeah but I don t think Chelsea will fire Mourinho
Obviously I m a biased Liverpool fan but 13 14 was ridiculous Suarez had one of the best years that I ve ever seen from any footballer Yaya Toure was at his peak devastating bullying best Mourinho blew his chances of winning the league in his first year back at Chelsea with conservative tactics Tactics Tim had that beautiful gilet and weird salute thing with Adebayor Fulham hired a crazy guy and Moyes ruined Man U Crazy season This season is good so far though even if Liverpool have been mostly bad
We got Klopp that s the best part of this season
13 14 a good season depends on the perspective I guess
We only lost 2 0 to City not 3
Oh man seems I have a real problem reading and copying Apologies
It feels good that we only fit in this because of a very unfortunate own goal
we only lost 3 1 to Southampton
Ugh I had the results written out right in front of me as I made it and I still ballsed it up Apologies
Literally a cicrlejerk
This graphic for new r soccer logo
BPL is the most entertaining league Great density at the top great international players and teams with lots of tradition still being at the top Downsides are the atmosphere in the stadium and the lack of homegrown talent EDIT for some reason I like Stoke
In reference to your latter point lack of homegrown talent that s one of the reasons it s been so exciting to follow Spurs lately It s a shame that it does seem so rare but hopefully with investment in academies we ll see such things become more common
convert him Convert Him CONVERT HIM RUMMENIGGER THE SPURS SUPPORTER
Sod off We don t have many foreign supporters we need all the ones we ve got
Give the paperwork on that Messi transfer some time and you ll be good
Well not too much time otherwise our fax machine might start having problems
Go Stoke
Everyone s a Stoke fan when they want to downplay Messi or Barcelona
I ll fight you for him
I was really sad that I didn t name myself Rummenigga
it s ok we got u
Uhhh autocomplete
All of ours are injured
EDIT for some reason I like Stoke Top lad Most of the atmospheres are decent really its the top teams with their day trippers who struggle
EDIT for some reason I like Stoke All the right reasons
For some reason continentals think when we say it s the best league it means the highest quality teams when it s only because it s the most exciting even if the quality isn t as high
It might still be if you account for the entire table
Atmospheres at the big clubs maybe
Just wait till next year and your move into a bowl stadium
That s when we become a big club you heard it here first domalino
Atmosphere at West Ham has been slowly dying for years Doubt there will ever be a game like the Ipswich play offs again which is kind of sad
I was at the home leg of the Ipswich game and I have a season ticket this year and I disagree Think that s an odd game to pick because there have been better games since beating Chelsea a few weeks ago was about as good as any game I ve been to Even Everton in the cup last year with less than 30 000 fans there Every Tottenham game
Ya the top teams have superstars are fun to watch and are prone to playing like shit every third or 4th week so the other sides aren t completely out of it
Stoke
wouldn t you be able to do this in any league with no undefeated teams
Not necessarily no If you have teams that have only beaten the same teams for example it gets tricky Also only 13 games in to a season is quite early however in that crazy 13 14 season it only took 10 games
Oh ok thanks for clarifying that up
No worries Also it was made trickier by the fact Leicester have only lost one Tottenham have only lost one and Aston Villa have only won one so their positions were fixed in the circle next to Arsenal Man U and Bournemouth respectively
Not necessarily because it s possible a league has two teams who have only lost once each but both to the same team You wouldn t be able to do a circle if that were the case
Where everybody is kinda not really good and everyone will watch the UCL semis from their comfy couch
The whole anybody can beat anybody thing is true of every league in the world and I still don t understand why people only ever say it about the Premier League like they re unique or something Even in supposed one two horse race leagues like La Liga the juggernaut teams almost always lose a couple of games a season to teams they shouldn t be losing to
Because big teams lose to small teams very often that hardly happens in la liga and especially the bundesliga Although it does happen from time to time it s just a lot more uncommon Plus imagine barca bayern or madrid in the position chelsea is in right now Quite literally impossible But not saying the competitiveness of the league is the sole reason for the bad form but it does contribute
Plus imagine barca bayern or madrid in the position chelsea is in right now Quite literally impossible on the other hand could you imagine Chelsea or city or united sinking into mediocrity like AC Milan did in serie A
You mean like we did 5 6 years ago Doesn t happen often I grant you but it still happens
Something like Chelsea is literally happening for the first time in the Prem it s a bit silly to infer anything from it It s exceptional Well except for Dortmund last season I guess
How fast are people forgetting United under Moyes
Moyes United wasn t nearly as bad as Chelsea were in their first 12 or so games this season
No but other aspects of their respective declines are similar
That s because the big teams in Bayern Madrid and Barca are better and more consistent than the teams fighting for the title in the EPL
True u Al Gala needs to give us an infographic of upset frequency to really measure the stratification of the top leagues
Marketing
I feel like The Circle of Life should be playing in the background There s even a lion with a crown on its head
I got you https youtu be VxTQKxyJyxw
Fuckin hell norwich scored 2 goals against newcastle amazing up front Just the back was the problem
I remember that one time Villa won a match What a day
Any particular reason why you made the scores on the bottom half as if they were away wins I am not moaning about it just found it very confusing
I tried to make it so the team s score was closest to their logo I m graphically challenged though and didn t know how best to put it on the thing
Here is the one from 13 14 season http i imgur com oGtMJF2 jpg I personally find that way easier I could not imagine any kind of layout with scorelines in there either tough task
Yeah I did that one too tried to step it up with scores this time haha
Ah I was wondering since you mentioned that in your other comment here Really challenging design with the scorelines I will see if I can come up with something as well
I actually hadn t seen it as Elinaeri did although of course that is the standard football naming convention Scores closest to the logo made sense to me
Maybe as a cyclical human centipede
Can someone make one of these for the 03 04 season
Look at how much we suck look at our top teams failing week in week out That must mean the league is more competitive s
Football Feed on facebook have nicked your post
Well technically it s after 106 games played
I m glad we could do our part with our one win against Bournemouth
I ll believe that when we beat Palace
A Condorcet circle The cool thing about Condorcet circles is that you can delete all of the results from all of the matches involved in the circle and get the same rankings The thing is though that this is probably not the only Condorcet circle in the EPL this season
I am not sure but I don t think this holds true if the teams are separated by goal difference
Right only zero sum results Disregard the scores

Where anybody can beat anybody Except Villa Villa can only beat Bournemouth
this is really cool
Awfully kind of Villa to only win one game this year to give our content creators somewhere to start
Giggled at Liverpool beating Stoke 1 0 thinking about last year and all
Do this for the 2003 04 season
urgh probably the only team to lose to sunderland Most depressing night this season
I will see if I can come up with scores this time haha AhC
Ah ok that went over my head P
I think he does often play as a right back he s right footed
Let s talk about facts

where did Koscielny play before I thought he had been a centre back since the beginning of his career at Guingamp Tours Lorient
idk lol it all happened so fast
wow does anyone have a gif of Ward s skill to get around kaboul just now i think it was an elastico or nutmeg too quick to tell
after triumphantly turning into Diamond Palace last match v Liverpool I fully expect Palace to play like Tin Palace and go 0 2 down against Sunderland today within 20 minutes
Maybe Sarfaraz Ahmed 48 off 46 and Misbah 68 off 72 to win that match against SL in dying light in Jan 2014 Also definitely Sehwag 83 off 68 v England he turned a draw into a win Finally Sarwan and Chanderpaul chatting 418 v Aus in 2003
Apparently pontus wernbloom and Cheick Tiot
Is there not a rule in place that prevents loanees from playing against their parent club
Ah ok
That pass to Arnautovic was class don t know who did it tho

nice thanks for the threadDamn number 66 is not looking good today
That s Marcio Azevedo i really don t know why he s at Shakhtar or how he s been doing but he was average to shit in Brazil
But he always had 5 Star skills on FIFA
he has 4 get your shit together
He had 5 in FIFA 12
i am aware always had not sound weird to anyone else tho plus he wasn t even on fut 14 and 15
Fifa 12 13 legend
Probably has a very good agent
Most big teams get the world class brazillian talent Shakhtar ends up mostly with average ones Jadson Douglas Costa and William are probably exceptions
Not really most of their offensive buys were once a great prospect here Bernard did extremely well in Brazil and won Libertadores with Atletico Fred was bought early in his Internacional career but he was already highly rated Taison was great at Internacional where he also won the Libertadores Wellington Nem who hasn t been playing also did quite well at Fluminense and was considered a young prospect in Brazil Alex Teixeira was as highy rated as Coutinho in the beginning of their career at Vasco Then you have Fernandinho Douglas Costa Jadson Willian The average players they get are defenders like Marcio Azevedo and Ismaily
I am actually brazillian too but now living in Spain I know the trajetory of most of the players you mentioned and we have to be honest there is a reason a lot of talented players dont suceed or arent as great as they look the brazillian league isnt on a high level for something about 10 12 years most of the talent ends up being not even close to world class when they come to Europe
me and every other brazilian fan might agree that the league isn t nowhere near as it once was but still those players were good young prospects once if they turn out to be world class or not that s another thing

That was the most hardman nutmeg and lob combination i ve ever seen Awesome
Dani is a warrior It s criminal that Danilo has started over him
He looks like he spends his spare time lumberjacking
What a goal from a right back with his weak foot
dani and luka scoring in the same match i m not crying you re crying
Ronaldo with a goal and two assists
Assist of the year right there
it s almost as good as busquet s assist
Master playmaker Anderson
Hans J rg Butt is the real deal
I m a fan of Tom Carroll s assist to Bale
that is beautiful Robben was certainly lucky to have a guy like Butt helping him to get on the scoresheet
I miss him
He s OUR Anderson now
Prefer this one from Xavi
HAHAHAHA Klopp
Busquet will remind that for the rest of his life He will tell his grandsons about that one for sure
Exquisite passing
here go
Savage
this is a real madrid post get that barcelona trash out of here
you see those men in white
Well real madrid are in the gif
This one too mate http youtu be yWVrolNQ4RU
Talk about being bitter lol
Still bummed out about last weekend
I don t think he s a Madrid fan
Why is this the top comment
Still managed to miss few chances
Decoy90 Okay so where s the real banter
No banter whatsoever I m glad he s back in form but he can be even better
He s just scored again lol But I don t believe he s back in form
Exactly how I feel It s going great for him but it doesn t feel like he s in top form I mean it s two assists and two goals can t be much better on paper but there is room for improvement
Can he even get back to form his knee problem isn t gonna go away with playing more lol
That is an excellent goal
Azevedo still living off his Fifa 13 self because it s clearly not working out for him irl
hahaha 5 skills
Where are the people saying Carvajal isnt offensive
Sweet nutmeg but surely that shove would be a foul right
Best goal of the night for me
Carvajal Danilo
Carvajal is just as good attacking as he is at defending Danilo is just as bad attacking as he is defending
what a goal
Has to be a starter this guy
What a rough game number 66 is having Also great goal from carvajal
What s with the recent explosionin the number of fullback goals
Fullback envy sweeping Europe
I love how he just nutmegs him and as the defender is trying to recover he just shoves him to the side
Isn t that a foul on 66
That was unexpected
hnnng fucking awesome
Yasss
nice curl
I can t tell if that was a cross or a shot Still a sexy goal regardless
Am I the only one for whom none of the streamable links are working right now
Why was the camera so zoomed in Thought it was a replay at first
The Shakhtar defenders find new ways to be crap for each goal
Does anyone have a normal angle Absolutely hate that let s zoom in on one player crap
Carvajal going James on this one
Jesus chris what a belter
What exactly is a belter supposed to mean I always assumed it meant fast hard and direct
yea that wasn t a belter by any means
Goalazo
What a cross
Ronaldo must be pissed at that
deleted
huh
I m surprised to see Ronaldo do those fakes I ve heard that he hasn t done many dribbling tricks recently Or is that just talking about 5 star skill type stuff
He hasn t done any skill to put a defender behind in like i don t even know Those fakes he does them every day
OK I don t really watch Madrid games I d rather not stay up until 5am for a game that isn t Arsenal the Socceroos or a World Cup finalSorry man I know you want to praise your defender but if Sterling put that on target either to Buffon s left or right that would have gone in It was a terrible miss from Sterling no defending could have saved you there

Felix Brych is such a terrible referee woeful calls all across the game Edit Every fucking year as well God fucking damnit
What A Goal
Anybody have any idea what s going on with Hart
Feeling a red card coming The players are getting fed up with it all
Unable to go back since I m relying on other people s streams Normally I would be able to go back into the match to grab that for you but now tonight Sorry mate

Maybe try selecting a role for him in that position that s what I do So instead of CM Playing position select CM Central Midfielder That s what I do when I want to re train my player and it seems to help
He s still at United in 2018 in my save Getting decent amount of apps but not a key player United did buy Kane in their first season so they play him instead
Getting no yellows is pretty difficult thing to do Your players will make tactical fouls and or lose their head and make rash challenges It s pretty much impossible to not get carded at least once in a game
Can I see your squad I m currently playing with Gent and I m only in 2018 so I m still struggling a bit
Get Zabaleta
HOLY SHIT BOYS THEY DID IT Belgium is proud of you
Pretty fucking stupid that two four steps are guarded
That first minute red card though
Probably Pardew
Fuck I didn t get Bolasie s skill that lost him the ball in itSorry i just went off of what the article said not very knowledgable about Sweden Thanks for correcting that
Thats actually an awesome picture thanks for posting it
After they see how he handles Messi and Neymar at the Euros they will definitely sign him
3978 miles to go see Belgium in a friendly against the US in Cleveland Ohio Well worth it
Jelle Vossen from Burnley to Club Brugge is comfirmed Signed a 5 year contract
LvG s Notes
Ghost corner in Belgian first division game
How about Vidic s double tackle
Belgium put up their tent in Cyprus box hopefully some goals follow real soon here Starting to look like shooting practice out there
De Bruyne Gotze Kagawa
Robot Celebration
Same goes for The Netherlands sometimes they are referred to as just Holland while this is technically not the whole of The Netherlands It would be the same as referring to Great Britain s team as England
I like it but using Fellaini next De Bruyne feels funny to me In the future we d have Thorgan Musonda Jr or Praet for that spot Not that I rate them that highly but just seems like a position better fit for them
I agree with your future midfield line up In 4 6 years Tielemans Malanda Musinda would ve been a massive midfield Kind of like Witsel Fellaini Defour back in Standards days
I feel you My choice for Origi is based on the fact that i feel he will have a growth period in the next two years that will make him more compatible with the players around him like Hazard and De Bruyne He is more unpredictable than Lukaku in the field but I got to give Lukaku credit though As for Benteke he seems to be having trouble finding his form maybe a transfer to a bigger team make change that for him
Belgium for Euros 2016 not much difference from WC2014 GK Courtois RB Meunier CB Kompany CB Alderweireld LB Vertonghen CDM Witsel CDM Niangolan RM Mirallas CAM De Bruyne LM Hazard ST Origi
Probably pretty unknown but Tom De Mul Belgian winger who spent his youth at Ajax similar route as Vertonghen Vermaelen and Alderweireld Managed to get a transfer to Sevilla which wasn t a bad club at the time but couldn t stay fit so retired when he was 28 last year Also Arsenal s Diaby and Spurs s King
They forgot Toby Alderweireld on loan at Southampton from Atletico Madrid and ex Ajax And of course other but thought he deserved a mention since Southampton is second in the BPL atm
I don t know if he counts yet since he hasn t proven himself in a top competition yet but Martin Odegaard is 15 years old and made his debut for Norway s national team already http youtu be Smi8jvNixL8
Thank you This is awesome I didn t know any of this Missed those good years sadly
Thank you so much that s so interesting Didn t know any of this How old was Totti when Real Madrid bid for him
Can someone tell me more about the hype around Totti and Pirlo when they were younger I was way too young to remember how they started out and i feel they ve been left out of this discussion
I feel that PSG would try to bring back Eric Gerits back to France He s familiar with the French way of playing and was a solid coach at Marseille Would be a surprise though Maybe even give Zidane a chance although these two are both Marseille men at heart you never know what money will do
Carlos Puyol will possibly make a good future coach He used to always be driven to steer his fellow team mates to stay focused and play their position correctlyI wonder if the defenders had played that to the end would Ronaldo still had made that weak header or would he have done something different They would ve certainly got to that if they didn t stop playing EDIT Also that defender marking Ronaldo should probably try to keep an eye on his man
Id be furious as a manager if I saw that heck even as a fan Id be mad
heck Please watch your language
it s a family show
I don t give a crud
Just imagine what kind of foul language we d be seeing if he was the manager
You kiss your mother with that mouth
Makes me think of the WC qualifier knockout between Sweden and Portugal Guys this Ronaldo chap is pretty good keep an eye on him
yea to be honest that should have been stopped Also on side note you can clearly see the lack of form he is still in with that attempt on net A form ronaldo would have put a solid effort on net Regardless goal and hopefully it helps him and the rest of us get back up from that loss sat
I know Ronaldo s fast but that afro guy didn t even try there until the pass was already on it s way
that Shakhtar defender
Defender
Hooooooly shit imagine letting the best player in the world run into your box in acres of space Edit I guess I mean one of the best thanks for the downvotes you morons
Wow 20 downvotes for asserting that Ronaldo might be the best player in the world
i mean it really is an absurd contention at this point
Didn t see Messi in the video
What was that number 66 doing
Gee I think that s Ronaldo
Dude couldn t be bothered to track back 10 feet Would have been an easy clearance The center back too looks like he could ve got there but he gets caught giving up before the ball is even in Not that the goal was his fault though
It was actually number 99 doing a handstand
He looks more like a rugby player than a footballer
probably hoping it would lead to a counter attack didn t really work out
that defending reminded me of this IRL lag posted over at r gifs by u fromthepharcyde
He s to my right I got him
What a pass by Bale
Modrics pass That was magic
Wouldn t mind seeing Modric at Bar a
Dude what is wrong with you
The Croatian double team with Rakitic Triple with Kovacic It s sexual
Croatian here By watching them play at the Croatian national team I would say they would do fuck all with all due respect to them they are indivudually amazing players Never seen them mesh together well though
Am I sexuuallll yeeeaaahhh Am I everything you need you better rock your gameplay now
He is a benfiquista
Just thought it would be amazing to see him playing there not that I dislike him at Real
Could anyone explain to me why he s being downvoted to oblivion I m genuinely curious as I don t understand what is going on here S Edit I m relatively unknowledgeable which is why I m trying to learn more
Probably because of the rivalry between Barca and Real It s like saying I d like to see Marcelo at Barca or Pique at Real
Ah okay thanks for the answer I appreciate it
Not sure if he was trying a Nacho goal of his own
Pardon me if this is a joke but Bale was going for goal
LOL yes he did think he missed the goal
Does fantastic to spot the run and then be able to float it over
Much credit to Bale for Cristiano s goal
Huh Bale He made a simple pass which was actually just a wide shot The real credit for this goal should go to Modric not Bale or Ronaldo He created this goal solely Ronaldo and Bales part could be done by a U 13 to be honest
Not sure what U 13 would be able to make that run or chip that Bale did I think you are selling him very short
I don t think you realise which players are which in this clip
Not if you ask Cristiano at least in this clip
Hurr durr ronaldo is so selfish
Le arrogant Cristiano amirite
You idiot Edit that s all I could say initially This 10 second clip wasn t long enough to show the part where he serenades Bale
I would ve broken my skull on that post
As soon as ronaldo started running towards it I got scared
wtf was that dude doing trailing ronaldo as if he wasn t going to score
Well me must ve just thought Oh well in Benitez s system Ronaldo has about 1 5th the shots he usually does Especially now that Neymar Suarez and Messi are playing so well Cristiano likely suspects he won t make the the three man list for the Ballon D Or leading to a loss of spirits which along side his knee injury and age can be attributed to his loss of recent form that is a greater part of his decline No need to follow him here
And then Oh shit
You really put some thought into this huh
Felaini really let himself go
Good team goal
Im glad Bale is looking healthy Hopefully he can keep it up
Inzaghi would be proud
Quite bad defending do they not realize how fast Bale is Great play by Bale and Modric though
They guy covering Cristiano is the true criminal here if you ask me He just kinda watched as Cristiano ran passed him
Oh man what a pass from Modric
Impure
Fck that was close
Madrid doing their best impression of Barca s goal the other day
Tapinaldo
7 10 players would probably miss that
Yeah those open net shots from 6 inches are insanely hard
No they wouldn t
Those passes though
meh
Well that almost ended tragically
I WANT TO HAVE MODRICS BABIES
what is it with defenders just ignoring ronaldo and allowing him to stroll unmarked into scoring positions
Number 66 is good
knock off Marcelo definitely didn t help
wow Modric
the world is a better place when Cristiano Ronaldo is scoring goals
Defender 86 might wanna mark the second best player in the world a little closer than that Just a thought
Neymar played yesterday unless you mean Suarez who also played yeterday
Goddamn can t a guy make a joke on an internet forum without dickheads being all sanctimonious about arbitrary rankings of grown men Fuck s sake
Seems like you can t take a joke either m8
s Just bants man BANTZ
Unless you mean Iniesta
Is he dare I say it Back
Bale assists Ronaldo Ronaldo pretends Bale don t be here
That defender running with Bale was pathetic but he made up for it by kicking the ball out of the goal after it had crossed the line
what the ACTUAL FUCK was 66 doing what the fuck was he thinking
Typical goal by him But that pass by Modric though
Ronaldo goals lack the flair they used to come with These recent ones look like spoon fed boringness
how was the celebration
Reminds me kinda of Barca s fantastic MSN goal yesterday actually Great for Ronaldo though he really needed that bit of confidence
Reminds you in what exactly In both the ball went inside
He s most likely mentioning those over top sort of flick balls into the area
yes that I thought r soccer was football forum where people understood the game lol no
This sub is pretty bad for serious discussion
Only if you have a Real Madrid flair and or try to compare anything other than gods to Barcelona s players
your understanding of the game is so deep man You recognized a forward over the top pass as similar to another goal Can Real Madrid hire you already
Good one jackass
How can you not see the similarities
You tell me
Well both are goals scored in a Champions League football game if that s what you mean
Great for Ronaldo the new kid on the block seems to have the potential to now aim for greater heights and probably play for Segunda someday
Almost scored on the same play ten minutes later but the next time the keeper stayed in goal to save Ronaldo s header
dont thank bale
But all the couch managers here told me that Ronaldo should be benched I don t even know if those people were serious or just blinded by their hate of this man
Good point he really proved everyone wrong by heading it in unmarked from about 6 inches outside the goal World class finish Ronaldo showing his best definitely not Bale and Modric
Only the GOAT can score goal like that
He scored and that s enough Doesn t matter how We can t be 100 sure that this situation and goal would have occurred without Ronaldo Also I am not trying to put Bale or Modric down I m just saying that people that never touched a ball in their lives should not make stupid comments Even if it s biased or because they hate him it s still retarded to say that real should bench him
He scored and that s enough Everything that is wrong with football viewers in the past 5 10 years
You do know that the objective of football is to outscore an opponent If this is wrong with football viewers then what do you suggest is right
Have a holistic view of football Goals and assists are just the final 2 moves in a chain of events I am not gonna pretend that they are not important but to pontificate on them at the exclusion of everything else is what is wrong with football analysis at the moment I blame Messi and Ronaldo
Mate you re making that assumption of me based on this post alone I m not saying that goals are everything I m a defender and love clean tackles more than anything I m just saying when a player especially a forward scores a goal or two then he has done his job
He s hardly proved anyone wrong This is the kind of goal that someone in a slump can score without changing their future performances one bit because it doesn t do shit for confidence If someone who could actually make runs and be a threat offensively had started there is no way to be 100 sure it wouldn t be 0 3 already
Lol the last paragraph is enough for me to understand that you are probably one of those who do not watch his matches regularly but still like to shit on him
Your comment history is enough for me to understand that you have a reputation for starting and encouraging circlejerks in the past I understand it s new for you to be on the other side for once
Yeah unfortunately you ve come across Shaqiriii the one user you can guarantee will be at the bottom of every thread he comments in I d ignore the guy
Oh believe me I know who he is Just another guy who views reddit as a platform for starting arguments
That still does not change what I said You try to get back at me but it does not change that you re probably one of those couch managers that like to speak a lot without knowing much
I actually haven t said shit about Ronaldo before I saw your comment today I just thought you were just waiting for an opportunity to pretend like you re right about Ronaldo even if he doesn t actually perform well
I never said anything about Ronaldo s recent form so no I wasn t waiting for something like this to comment that I was right Check my history if you re bored and that interested in it or take my word for it
Of course not I wasn t implying that all 400k of us in r soccer were just watching for a comment by you specifically But I can guarantee that you had a preformed opinion about Ronaldo s form and you were waiting for anything that you thought would allow you to get upvoted via hivemind Unfortunately for you this isn t enough for a reasonable person to say that Ronaldo has regained his form So you got downvoted
American flair Your argument is invalid
America flair Your argument is invalid
Is it really
Asshole spotted comment worthless
American Real Madrid fan Argument is garbage
And so is your attitude Grow up
Yeah nobody else could ve scored an empty net header Maybe he deserved the bench maybe not but one easy goal against Shakhtar isn t a good indicator
He never deserves the bench Maybe he can be rested in unimportant matches but claiming that he should be benched is just either being biased or clueless Even he plays bad there is no replacement Who would he be benched for
People don t want to bench him because someone else plays better it s because the bench could motivate Ronaldo to work harder and get back in form It s not a difficult concept to understand managers do it all the time with underperforming stars Pique Enrique Hazard Mou
There are different ways to motivate players Playing bad should be enough motivation for him to get back to his level He is a hard worker and dedicated I don t think motivation is the problem Maybe it s his issues with his legs or the managers tactics not clicking but I do not think its motivation Who knows
Man you defend Ronaldo with all your heart Are you his publicist by the way Has he thanked you for it yet
Oh look it s my number one fan Nice to see you too
So I ll take it he hasn t thanked you Man must be hard you must spend several hours on the internet arguing and defending him only for him not to notice
Well at least you get some appreciation from me for being such a good fan So at least one of us is being thanked
TIL defending a player on Reddit being a good fan Damn why didn t nobody tell me going to away games is costly If someone had told me I could show my appreciation to my team just by defending a player on the internet I would gladly save up some money for more important things
Couch managers lol
A lot of Madrid fans who don t hate Ronaldo have also asked for him to be benched so it s not just people who hate this man
Lol madrid fans C mon man a lot of Real and Barca fans here are a bunch of gloryhunters that will turn on their stars as soon as they stop performing It s not only people here even in the stadiums in Spain they turn on their own players It s not like I think that a comment is more believable if a Real fan makes them or the other way around with Barca
I m not talking about reddit look at Madrid forums on the internet read what many are saying and many claim Ronaldo is past it and that he should be benched And yeah like you said the Bernab u as well My point is that people who have said Ronaldo should be benched are not always blinded by hatred like you stated
Fair enough but I said I don t know if they are serious or biased That means that it s worse if they re unbiased and serious in my opinion And both fanbases are not the most stable ones so I take whatever madrid and Barca fans say with a grain of salt
A tap and 5 on Soccer sad
I thought he was past it
Yup that was an incredible finish Definetly shows the true Cristiano is back
Haha I I was just joking
nah Ronaldo has ended his goal drought with this 3 yard screamer so all his critics have been proven wrongLes yeux dans les bleus is a really great football documentary
Yes Maybe one of the best there is
True
technically it is always one of the best
What No A bad documentary couldn t be technically considered as one of the best
why not Did you define how many are the best It can be part of the 10000 best
Then technically I m one of the world s best footballers
technically you are

no no didn t you watch he likes to fake to his left but then shifts to the right
Humble in the way they have no ego they accept that Ronaldo is superior I m commenting on why the video is specifically beautiful to me Ronaldo being amazing goes without saying
Would you say it s as beautiful as a gay swan Edit Fuck all y all I still think it s funny

A description of how Ronaldo plays Foo foo foo foo foo
And It s gone Children in Africa could ve eaten that ball
Best 9 ever I m not even kidding
It s crazy considering he was at his best when playing for Barcelona before his injuries He was like 21 Imagine how good he would have been without injuries
He was so amazing that even later in his career when he was fat as fuck burdened by years of injuries and hypothyroidism he was scoring like just a regular world class player at Milan and one of the highest scorers in the WC He had set such high standards that all people could talk about late career Ronaldo was how shit he was
Even when at Real Madrid he was amazing yet nowhere near as good as his earlier years A lot of people seem to think his prime was at Real Madrid when he was actually much better at PSV Barca and Inter
Imagine what would happen if he stayed at Barcelona and later teamed up with Kluivert Jesus Christ
One season at Barca 47 goals in 49 games Then he left for a better contract no fucks given
Puskas and Gerd Muller would like a word They d all be up there though
Muller was an excellent goal scorer but that s it The purest poacher the world has ever seen but not a pure 9 like Ronaldo
M ller was pretty good at everything actually His goals were typical poacher goals but he was fairly involved in the game
I want my striker number 9 whatever you call him to score goals If he does it by dribbling past three players and scoring or poaching them it s the same result I would take the flashier one there But Gerd Muller also scored much more goals than Ronaldo so that weighs in his favor I guess for a game in their prime I would take Ronaldo Over a career I d take Muller Puskas was a good mix of both though
It s silly to compare Puskas and Muller to Ronaldo and declare who the better 9 is Let s not act like all 3 didn t put up video game numbers The former two might have scored 3 goals per match with their dicks but I don t think a pure poacher could ever pull that off in Ronaldo s era
Well its whatever works Ronaldo may be one of the best players i ve ever been alive to see but i ve seen better strikers Suarez for one may actually be one of the best strikers i ve seen in a long time in that he s incredibly intelligent incredibly consistent and incredibly athletic The best player i ve ever seen is Messi best playmaker i ve ever seen is a tough one but i d give it to Iniesta or Zidane and best forward is a toss up between Ronaldo or Cristiano Ronaldo Best dribbler has to be Ronaldinho but I ve seen Neymar one up him once or twice Its nice to look at our childhood heroes with a nostalgic nod but Ronaldo s career was plagued with injuries and a little more disappointment than a lot of people care to remember He was the focal point of one of the most talented squads in recent history which is a high honor in itself But as far as pure 9s go i ve seen better Shevchenko for example was a better striker Ronaldo was definitely more talented but goals are goals
u wot
The same people who think Ronaldo is the undisputed best striker of all time ever are the same people that think Ronaldinho is a top 10 player Paul Scholes is the best midfielder of his generation and Zidane is the sleeper hit of his generation There have been better strikers than Ronaldo as early as Thierry Henry in 2004 While his technique was flawless and his athleticism was incredible at one point he merely set the standard a standard that has been reached more than once in the last decade I fully accept anybody people calling him what he is a legend but being il fenomino doesn t make you the best of all time ever His entire career was defined by 8 years 1994 2002 8 nearly perfect years but there have been better scorers better forwards and faster players side then
Rofl Here is Luis Enrique s last week interview about Ronaldo I d seen him on television at PSV and thought wow Then he came to Barcelona He s the most spectacular player I ve ever seen He did things I d never seen before We re now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players but not then
Wow Current Barcelona manager has nothing but praise for former teammate and club legend Ronaldo Seriously People need to relax
Shearer too
Why would you be kidding He is the best number 9 of all time
Suarez will be in with a shout in a few years if he isn t already
how old are you if you don t mind me asking Ive watched r9 in his prime and currently enjoying suarez While suarez will no doubt go down as one of the great forwards R9 will for a long time be the best ever to play in the position There is no arguing this fact what he did back then was ridiculous Remember this was also an era when little touch didn t end of being called a foul An era when slide tackling was such a big part of the game It was a golden era for defenders
Asking his age comes across as a little condescending The things Suarez has achieved especially after only recently coming into a top team are incredible He s a magnificent player and his all around work effort I m sure puts Ronaldo s to shame Suarez is only 28 and if he maintains this level and remains injury free for another 4 years or so then we would truly be talking about one of if not the greatest strikers ever
lol not how i meant it what i meant was if he got a chance to see ronaldo on live tv or even live but yea
Team achievements shouldn t decide which player was better Ronaldo dominated La Liga at age 19 or 20 Suarez was having a good debut season in the Eredivisie at that age I m not sure if your age comment means that you really haven t watched him back in the day but if not I can only recommend watching some video footage of him He really wasn t called el fenoemno for nothing Even after his injury he was still playing on an incredible level so there will always be this big if concerning what could have been sadly And I definitely know how good Suarez is
LOL NO
I m 27 I m the perfect age to have some childhood bias for R9 Suarez is very close if not as good He s been dominating leagues for years
Suarez is not any where near as prolific but the comparison bears merit if only because they have a VERY similar playing style
I m 35 Suarez is miles away from the best Ronaldo The Ronaldo at Barcelona was not just the best player around he totally and utterly dominated the game He was unplayable
He carried mediocre Inter squad to ultra competitive Seria A in his first year only finishing 2nd due to controversial match vs Juve Also carried them to win UEFA cup Suarez is a beast but Ronaldo prior his 2x knee injuries was just on whole another level
controversial Nice euphemism
I think people tend to give more weight to what they see now R9 was truly one of the most dominant players I ve even seen And I m old
The sentiment that Suarez is as good or better as ronaldo was would ve been extremely dumb in the time period between 2010 and 2012 where he helped take Uruguay to the World Cup semi finals and the Copa America title and it would ve been just a tad controversial when he took Liverpool to a second place finish with a POTY worthy display But a treble and a clasico rout later I don t think its fair to undersell him any longer Suarez is exceptional and any notion that he isn t at Ronaldo s level is just weird I m not actually sure if there s anything Ronaldo could do back in the day that Suarez can t do now The only thing separating them is 3 biting incidents and a bit of racism
Ronaldo is still a class above believe it or not The speed power control finishing
not even close
Suarez is awesome deffo 1 striker right now I still believe R9 was the most talented forward out there though He was basically an upgraded Suarez faster stronger with better ball control 34 goals in 37 matches for Barcelona at age 21 Phenomenal And then injuries hit Also is it just me or did Suarez get smaller in Barcelona He was a boar in Liverpool and now he looks lanky
He may look less bulky but he s as strong as ever
Not really Probably not even top 10 since 2000
Name 10 better since 2000 then
I m not really agreeing with u KrisDoolan but this seemed a nice exercise to do so here we go I did not include CR7 because I consider him more a winger than a 9 Otherwise he d obviously be with the 5 guys above Suarez Players I ranked above Suarez ie if I ran a team and had to choose between prime Suarez and prime player X I d go for player X without thinking about it too much Ronaldo Raul Henry Messi Rooney Players that I rank kind of the same level as Suarez with the same reasoning as above I d have to think a long time before choosing between prime Suarez and prime player X Ibrahimovic Shevchenko Van Nistelrooy Drogba Eto o Totti Tevez Aguero Pre Chelsea Torres Benzema
Half the strikers you listed are mostly known for exceptional finishing They are essential for turning a really good team into a great team The wonderful thing about Suarez though is that he brings so much more than just scoring goals to the table He is absolutely essential for Barca s pressing He was playing both finisher and playmaker for Liverpool When Suarez left Liverpool they simply could not fill the hole in the team The other players you mentioned were wonderful players but teams can cope fairly well when they lose strikers like Van Nistelrooy Raul and Shevchenko
Of the prime player X in the first scenerio only Henry Messi and Ronaldo have a case against Suarez Of the 10 in the second pool only Shevchenko has a case Suarez is comfortably better than all the rest Rooney was great in his prime but nothing to write home about Drogba is my fav striker but Anelka was always better he s just a better captain Eto o Tevez Totti and Ibrahimovich are cult icons but they re not without competition Aguero Benzema Torres and Van Nistelrooy have always been effective and efficient but Suarez has always played a much bigger and better role for club and country And Raul wasn t that good Having scoring records doesn t make you the best striker ever He was great but Real Madrid had no problem replacing him or Van Nistelrooy for that matter when the time came I d liken them to Inzaghi great club legend not the best striker None of them compare to Suarez in the slightest
Del Piero Vieri Van Basten Baggio Bergkamp Batistuta They would all be above Suarez I d say
Rooney even at his prime better than Suarez lol
Props for putting in the effort Would take Suarez ahead of Rooney and Raul Also ahead of Shevchenko RVN Dorgba Totti Tevez Torres probably Karim as well Only one on that list I would absolutely without question take ahead of Suarez would be Messi and he s not actually a striker
Ronaldo Henry Van Nistelrooy prime Shevchenko prime Torres Raul Ibrahimovic Eto o Del Piero Aguero
good list you forgot prime Falcao comparing him to Ronaldo fenomeno is just silly they are different worlds
I was going to mention Falcao because he was an absolute monster at Atletico but I believe this is only his second ever season of Champions League football so I was kind of reluctant to put him in there
I d rather have him on my team over everyone else except maybe Henry Ronaldo and prime Shevchenko
Definite no on Van Nistlerooy Shevchenko Torres Raul Eto o Del Piero Aguero Other three are maybe s at best
I m sorry but motherfucking Ronaldo is not a maybe at best I think you re either massively exaggerating how good Suarez is or you don t remember just how good some of those players were Van Nistelrooy especially had a much better scoring record especially in the Champions League likewise with Shevchenko Raul and Eto o
Nostalgic revisionism I think you re overrating a number of those players especially RVN Sheva Raul
Ruud set a number of records for his goalscoring exploits and had an absolutely ridiculous record in Europe same goals per game as Messi and higher than Ronaldo Shevchenko won the Ballon d Or and is Milan s 2nd all time top scorer only behind Gunnar Nordahl It took Messi and Ronaldo until last year to beat Raul s CL goals record He was Real Madrid s top scorer ever until the start of the season Suarez has achieved shit compared to them
Trying not to be biased but you are really underestimating Del Piero one of the best Italian players to every play the game
What could ve been Ironic that both he and Ronaldo arguably the two most promising and best strikers in the world at that time would end up having their career ruined by their knees
I still don t think Brazil would ve won if Ronaldo was fully fit in the final but they would have played much better in attack
Its simple break his fucking legs
Thanks Roy Keane
FOU FOU FOU
Nice Fortunately for them Ronaldo ended up playing one of his worst ever games in that final
Well his name wasn t even on the teamsheet before the match it was a last minute decision to play him Doctor Lidio Toledo revealed the striker had been rushed to hospital after suffering a convulsion in his sleep but cleared to play after neurological and cardiac tests Such a shame really http news bbc co uk sport3 worldcup2002 hi history newsid 1749000 1749324 stm EDIT Also many other theories as to what happened the night before
There s a strong rumour that he was forced to play by sponsors most notably Nike
This
to this day I still believe the rumors that he was poisoned by the French in their hotel
he was definitely not 100 in that match The disparity between the final and the previous games is absurd Like two completely different players
Probably shouldn t have played at all
Cool seeing them all giddy like a fan would be seeing skill like that up close
Why is this unverified
This is amazing
Watching him in his prime was mesmerizing Just simply unplayable regardless of the talent you put against him

Wrong final

Whoops
I d say it s other way around Defenders can t keep their focus after seeing this face
Getting clowned on by that haircut would be roughReminder for you all This summer only Marseille lost Ayew Gignac Imbula Payet Thauvin to foreign clubs Plus Morel to Lyon Monaco lost Abdenour Berbatov Carrasco Falcao Kondogbia Martial to foreign clubs Kurzawa and Ocampos to PSG and Marseille Nantes lost Gakp Djilobodji Veretout to foreign clubs Saint Etienne lost Gradel Tabanou Erding to foreign clubs Plus Lyon losing Njie Lorient J Ayew Bordeaux Mariano Teams are constantly rebuilding Marseille and Monaco the worst this year EDIT This summer Ligue 1 has a 126 85 M gain on transfer Taking into account PSG and Lyon without them it s 239 15M which is 13 29M average to see the whole team being decimated Max is Monaco with 94 2M including the 80M Martial money QPR won 90M in TV Deal only last year Chelsea 136M
OM also lost Fanni and Lemina
Considering how big the population of France is it s strange how they never produced elite teams like Spain England Germany and Italy They ve had sporadic success but nothing consistent
That has nothing to do with population though Portugal has 10 million inhabitants and they have successfull teams in an european scale Aside from PSG french teams are not attractive enough because we do not have enough money to pay premier league like wages due to fiscality low tv rights deals less attractivity
My point is going back to the start of European football why did no huge teams develop in France like they did in other countries The national team wasn t great either until the 80s
Because historically rugby was a bigger sport in France than football
Oh ok I knew rugby was popular in France but had no idea it was actually bigger than football
Higher percentage of the French population plays rugby than in NZ In the south especially it s all rugby country
The french rugby league top 14 is the biggest rugby league in the world
In the southwest this is true but absolutely not anywhere north of the Loire and at least doubtful in the southeast
I don t think there s any way around the fact that France is an outlier The top 4 leagues are 4 of the 5 most populous nations in Western Europe Portugal may have strong teams league relative to population size but they re still well behind Spain England Germany and Italy
I was once told that in France the taxes alone of you declare over 1M income are upwards of 50 and to keep the big names happy and staying in PSG the Qataris actually cover those extra taxes for the players Not sure how true it is though
Not enough money Atletico s budget is comparable to that of Marseille and Lyon and they reached the CL final while OL and OM have a combined 0 1 10 in their last CL games Also was money the problem when Lyon got ONE point out of 6 against Gent When they were eliminated by APOEL When they were eliminated by Astra Giurgiu When PSG couldn t qualify for EL s round of 32 in a group with Slovan Bratislava and Red Bull Salzburg Let me be clear Ligue 1 sucks and PSG s titles have never felt so hollow But quit trying to find excuses for your poor management French football has never been at a lowest point in decades PSG is our only ray of light but then again We are owned by a dictatorship This situation sucks so much I fucking hate it
Actually Atletico s budget is around 190 million euros Marseille for this season has a budget of 125 million euros A huge part of the budget is dedicated to salaries As a fellow french you should know that the fiscality is very high compared to Spain Marseille for instance had to renovate their stadium same can be said for Lyon with their new stadium It is estimated that Marseille lost 26 million euros over 3 years because of that don t know about Lyon but given it is their stadium and they paid for it the loss is huge Also we had to sell key players this summer so we could conform with FFP regulations Gignac left for free Payet Imbula Ayew left Nkoulou and Mandanda will be leaving FOR FREE at the end of the season We can not just pay premier league like wages because we simply do not have the money to Sure there is probably a problem in terms of management but for some reason and probably others I m far from being knowledgeable on the subject we lack the money to compete internationaly Best clubs are the richest that s all
We lack the money to compete internationally How do you explain that Portuguese clubs constantly trample ours That teams from Cyprus eliminated OL and Nice Danish club eliminated Saint Etienne
French clubs tend not to take europa league seriously because there is little financial reward with a huge investment given that there is way more fixtures in an already overbooked schedule See Christophe Galtier comment a year ago or so Portuguese clubs bring very talented players from south america through third party ownership and anyway the transfer fee is low Plus their academy is on point
That s true but I don t what your point is Are you saying that money isn t the main problem and Portuguese clubs are much better managed than us
I was just explaining why they have more success than us with a lower budget
Well that s kind of my point isn t it If we recruited better and if we took Europe more seriously we wouldn t be in this situation
Incomparable
Comparable In 2013 2014 Atletico s budget was 170M Marseille s 130 One went to the Final of the CL the other 0 0 6 in the group stages
Ah I see what you mean although there are other factors to consider as well
Of course of course But we in France always like to blame it on money I m saying that s really not our main problem
It is very strange only one winner in all of European Cup Champions League history
When has the EPL had consistent success in Europe outside of 04 09
Through the 70s and 80s across each competition
How so
A team in the european cup final 9 times between 1975 1985 7 times winners Spread across 4 different teams imagine any league doing the same now
Look up European Cup finals between 1976 and 1985
Ah I took his statement to mean two decades of dominance though I think the run was from 76 84
England were solid from 70 76 dominant from 76 85 and probably would have continued to be for a little while if not for the Heysel disaster
England were solid from 70 76 Might want to extend that window a bit m8 I mean who could forget our stunning Inter Cities Fairs Cup victory over jpesti D zsa in 1969
English and German teams pretty much exclusively dominated European football in the 70s and 80s until Heysel
The fact that almost none of them own their own stadia and rent from local councils really holds them back
Don t forget that Lyon also have Fekir unavailable due to his torn ACL that he got two months ago
Saint Etienne also sold Maximin to Monaco if that counts
So you are saying the league is shit Except for PSG
The league is poor
Ligue 1 is being bought out by the big 4 leagues but it s France s fault Why aren t French clubs offering bigger contracts bar PSG
LOL Clubs can t type rosebud IRL you re pretty much asking why a single mom working as a waitress can t buy a Lambo
Euuh because they don t have the money You know that with all the taxes a player costs to his Ligue 1 club 17 times what he would cost to a spanish club And if the player ends up being injured or shit DNCG will make sure you re relegated France is not Spain
It s France s fault exactly Not French clubs fault Here over 1M a year 50 goes to the country Under it s more complicated but let s say about 25 So if you want a player to earn 5M a year the club has to pay 9 5M approximately And I have probably forgotten A LOT of things I actually don t know shit about this juste it s super high tax here for high salaries Plus French club aren t wealthy compared to English clubs because English clubs are the main problem Spanish German Italian too but mainly English PS I love MKP Was a big fan during the MKP DRG area at MLG

PSG should just start playing David Luiz as striker just for laughs
Fifa irl
That s not healthy
Not for my blood pressure certainly
This kills the Ligue 1
Solution Espanyol and Barcelona to Ligue 1
Blame it on PSG if you want but Lyon only has 25 points after 14 games that s really not a lot for a 2nd
So everyone in the league is bad It s just PSG are average
I d rather say everyone in the league is average beside PSG who are good Nice lost against Ajaccio and Nantes but went to beat Lyon and Marseille for example PSG can afford to keep their best players which brings stability Marseille and Monaco lost half their team during summer Only Lyon kept their players wages were raised but eventually they lost F kir
Didn t Monaco lose half their team due to a change in policy They have plenty of money right They could have retain some players
It s a mixture of things but they definitely did want to mix up their squad a bit to hopefully get a better project going They let go of a lot of prospects that they felt were not panning out like Ocampos for example We lost half our squad because the club isn t very profitable any more Ayew and Labrune tried several times to extend his contract and our owner simply doesn t give a shit any more They netted 50m off of the sales of our squad this summer and she s going to sell as soon as someone offers
Things haven t been going that great for OM a shame that s happening to a team as great as you I really hope you regain your rightful place in Ligue 1
Eh thanks for the kind words but we have no right to anything in the league We get what we deserve and it s not weird that we are doing poorly given the circumstances It looks like Michel finally figured things out last weekend so I m hoping things will begin to improve
They had to sell some to break even per FFP but Martial wasn t supposed to be sold but given the 80 million offer it was impossible to reject
Why does Monaco lose so many players Aren t they still supported by a rich suggardaddy
Beside this divorce story he eventually did not lost half his money to his ex wife as far as I know they have to sell because of FFP AS Monaco because of its history has many fans in the whole France they ve one of the best away crowd But the home stadium is empty because Monaco is small and full of rich people And this can t work with FFP
He s lost basically nothing to his wife she is in huge debt and will have to completely capitulate at this point he has offered her half of what he originally offered her at the beginning of proceedings and only for 10 years rather than the rest of her life and she ll have to take it His daughter sided against the mother and basically shot down most of her case The issue is that he is happy to spend money as he has shown but he will not spend money if it means he ll have to pay millions in fines to UEFA so the policy shifted from big name star signings to young players with a lot of potential and Jardim with complete control of the squad and transfers along with a Portuguese scout he brought with him They buy low sell high and it will allow a core of players to develop and sell off one or two each season to cover the loss a like Lyon 10 years ago except a bigger safety net So they sold a lot of players one more than they wanted to Martial but obviously with 80 million on the table it was impossible to reject but the project isn t over
Yup you explained their change of policy and their new project well The only thing is that given the context it s even more difficult to create a chemistry between players in Monaco imo They had it last year and they sold everyone I doubt they can create this every year And when you bring in so many new players the risk is to miss on the CL spots Less exposure for the players and you can t sell too high beside they don t buy thaaat low they buy pretty high and want to sell very high
Makes sense I just wish that they d balanced the team better I mean yeah sell Martial for that crazy fee but then buy a good centre back and a good LB RB and another DM Then they d probably be okay Instead they have like 20 wingers and attacking midfielders and two 35 year olds playing defence
Sugardaddy that lost half his money to his ex wife IIRC
That wasn t true actually
Ok my mistake then The thing is he doesn t want to spend huge money on Monaco now so they are more a seller club than a buyer like any club in France other than Lyon or Paris The fact that English clubs are drunk with money that the french taxes cost a lot to the clubs makes the best players of the league go away and team are constantly rebuilding Plus this season PSG are performing good and all the others quite badly explaining this Actually PSG point per game is lower than Bayern per instance but Lyon has really few points for a 2nd after 14 games
We play bad while PSG play how they should with the budget they have They only have 2 draws and no loses so far
Mid and low table clubs are doing surprisingly well hello Nice and Angers Top table clubs are doing quite bad JUST LOOK AT MY CREST
It s that PSG is excellent and that other middle sized team especially Lyon Marseille and Monaco had a pretty rough start
Off topic but I can t wait to see Red Star get promoted and have a Paris derby in Ligue 1 do you think it could happen soon
Red Star is currently 6th 4 points behind Metz 3rd I honestly think it s going to be complicated this year especially since the games have to be played in Beauvais as Stade Bauer doesn t suit the league s standards But for a club like Red Star there s no need to rush sometimes it s better to spend a few years in Ligue 2 before playing with the big boys especially because of DNCG Red Star doesn t have a strong financial back up like Paris FC with fuckin Vinci
Seriously We don t blame it on PSG because we want we blame it on PSG because this is without a doubt entirely their fault PSG fans have nothing to do with it though you can t expect them to want their team to not win every game
PSG fault if teams like Lyon or Marseille underperform terribly They should have much more points by now and this thread wouldn t exist Lyon Marseille Monaco all have budgets above 100M Caen and Angers 25M Lyon lost against La Gantoise I think it s around 30M Those teams are underperforming I can t see how this is without a doubt entirely PSG fault
Can we just stop the season and call it a wrap right now I mean we all know what s going to happen the rest is just filler crap like Dragon Ball Z
Nah dude it s too interesting for us We could be top 6 or relegated nobody knows
I for one hope relegated Imagine the clusterfuck
Honestly it would just be the current clusterfuck amplified a bit and might even help get the club sold So oddly enough I m not as afraid of that as I should be Besides won t you miss the Aluas Labrune bantz
Imagine Aulas twitter with Labrune in Ligue 2 though That s just sounds like Christmas
I think we re forgetting there probably would be no more Labrune if we were relegated at least there better not be He could go to ASSE for continued banter
I would be ok with that even though CL football may kill us straight away
On the one hand Lyon have 25 points in 14 games so 25 42 which is poor for second place On the other PSG have 38 42 which is also huge That s what leads to such a disparity an extraordinarily good 1st place team but also a very mediocre second team
That is one of the consequence of the EPL being so rich The best french players used to leave France for the big 4 now they even leave top 5 teams in France to play bottom teams in England The only team that can keep its players is PSG Then english fan complain that it is easier for PSG in champion s league because Ligue1 is uncompetitive But you created the monster
Let s see there s Thauvin going to Newcastle the Ayews going to Swansea and Villa Hazard and Zouma going to Chelsea so yeah players from top 5 teams in France are leaving to play for relegation zone teams except for Swansea of course
You glossed over Payet to West Ham Azpilicueta and Remy to Chelsea
Remy left Marseille for QPR
He took the long way
I think the conversation was only about bottom half teams so fair shout on the Chelsea ones but Payet is going to a much more relevant club in West Ham which is understandable
Amavi Vertout to Villa as well
I spy the hidden bantz
Big 4 being Real Barca Bayern United
Maybe he means big 4 in England Arsenal Chelsea City United in recent memory
I think in this context the big 4 refers to Arsenal Chelsea United and Liverpool
Sky 4
Arsenal Leicester City United FTFY
Arsenal Leicester City United Leicester City so good they take up two spots in the top 4
No dude I was talking about Bristol City
Wait not Norwich City the ones who put a mighty 2 past Newcastle and constantly produce goals of the season
Fucking Norwich Hell no
I think he meant Lyon Marseille and maybe Lille and PSG
What are you talking about We had to sell Gameiro Nullifying our chances of european victory forever
Kind of off topic but what the hell happened to Lyon They used to be a top team in Europe and roll Ligue 1 year after year and now they are bottom of their group in the CL behind powerhouses like Zenit and Gent and haven t won the league since 2008
Lyon had a formidable upcoming in the mid 2000 s Very well managed They started making good money and saved it Then they for some unexplained reason they splashed all of their cash on Kader Keita 2007 16 Million Ederson 2008 14 million Jean II Makoun 2008 14 million John Mensah 2008 9 million Michel Bastos 2009 18 million Yoann Gourcuff 2010 26 5 million Pretty much every single one of them was a flop Then they decided it was the perfect time to build a stadium BOOOM
All you need to know
This is a good perspective but really only addresses the past couple seasons I m wondering more why they went from historically dominant in the mid 2000 s to where they are now Certainly the rise of PSG and their unlimited funds has something to do with it in the most recent seasons but they were falling from glory even before that for some reason They won 7 straight titles from 2002 2008 which is pretty amazing
they are bulding their own stadium so their last big transfert 30m was hm gourcuf in 2010 but he fails with injurys less than 30 full games played in 5 five years since 2011 they are only on young players and own formation lacazet fekir grenier gonallon martial but sold to monaco like arsenal did during many years
But we went to finish second in the ligue with 8 of our starter being formed at the club Lopes Umiti Gonalons Ferri Tolisso Grenier Lacazette Fekir If only we could form more defender instead of buying shitty player for 8 millions But guess they don t sell for the same amount so are not worth
They started overpaying for average players That s what shocked me the most And when talks about FFP began they decided to invest on a new stadium which will be finished soon Meanwhile they mostly had to rely on their academy players Ligue 1 s lack of attractivity didn t help them As well as the rise of Bordeaux and Lille

Interesting read
PSG have been able to sleepwalk through the league so far Even their bad performances have been mostly unpunished This is more indicative of the exodus in talent this year I don t expect it to stay this way next season
Yeah especially since many PSG players will play this summer You could see last season that PSG poor start was due to the players being tired and injury proned after the World Cup While OM players looked very very strong physically
Remember when they lost to Caen last year Good days
Owww you
I surely do inb4 it happens again
It s like when I play FIFA Career Mode on intermediate
Can t get away from the viral Bernie Sanders marketing anywhere on this site
Reddit has to do it because no one else will Hillary will probably win the nomination pretty easily in the real world she is much more recognizable Not that I would mind Sanders as president but this site is it s own little bubble You would have thought Ron Paul was going to be president last time this was the only place you read about American politics
I was just having a good natured pop at our old troubling but useful friend Modern Capitalism
First time I ve been on Reddit for Months and live in a Red State Bernie is pretty popular Favorite to win the Democratic nomination No At this point he is more than a dark horse However will young people get out to vote in the primaries History says probably not
PSG seem like they really need Ronaldo next season
How s that
It was sarcastic There s a lot of speculation over Ronaldo going to PSG and clearly PSG seem to be doing fine without one of the best players on the planet
I believe he s referring to how Real Madrid are starting to play worse with him on the pitch than if someone else who is younger and not nursing a chronic knee injury would be playing
Lyon won Ligue 1 7 times back to back this is nothing
Without having a Qatari daddy And we never steamrolled it
Without having a Qatari daddy Hmm Lyon went public Stock market daddy Also let s not forget OL Coiffure and OL Taxi

This is a really cool stat fact
Noice
Inb4 PSG is ruining the league
You fucking are though Like seriously I like that you re playing well in Europe but watching the league is a fucking chore with your Qatari whores ruining the integrity of football
Your club did the same for 7 years though And you used to buy the best players from Ligue 1 thus weakening the league
Oh yeah totally similar situations Aulas is some foreign prince that injected a shitload of money in the club There s a difference between strategic presidents and sugar daddies
Precisely situations are not the same Lyon bought the best players from other Ligue 1 teams to secure their 1rst spot every year PSG brings in international stars which increases the TV rights on par with Germany can you imagine which makes more money for Lyon and the other clubs PSG does have shitload of money It doesn t mean this money isn t used as wisely as it can be QSI s strategy is pretty neat if you ask me Aulas is the best president in France It doesn t mean he didn t make big mistakes that cost a lot to OL Cissoko 15M remember
Lyon bought the best players from other Ligue 1 teams to secure their 1rst spot every year You re saying that as if it was easy and we just overspent everbody else they wanted to come here because they believed in what Aulas was creating most of them at least because had we ended up getting Pauleta or Drogba we d probably have a CL Budget wise PSG and Marseille were close to us Nowadays PSG spend 5 times more than anybody else that s not comparable We bought Essien Malouda and Abidal when they were unproven outside of France to Bastia Guimgamp and Lille not really contenders back then Paris buys Ibra Di Maria D Luis Cavani Thiago Silva just the same right We dominated because other big clubs were badly ran now the other big clubs don t even have a chance
Yeah you have some good points Although I think Aulas didn t really want Pauleta he just wanted to destabilize PSG back then by offering him a lot of money Essien Malouda and Abidal are good examples Shame you couldn t capitalize on the successes of this policy who knows what your budget would be like today Instead Aulas started overpaying for average players He was also unlukcy with Gourcuff Ofcourse with all this money PSG is supposed to lead the league But this thread is about those 13 points between PSG and Lyon This shows more about how the other big clubs are underperforming And honestly Marseille and even Lyon since a few years are badly run too
How are we badly run We had to trim the salary bill a lot starting around 2011 to pay for the new stadium so Aulas gambled on going young and we have finished 4 3 5 2 in those rebuilding years now we re back to regular spending We ll see if we can consistently play the CL now
Mostly the choice of players and the money spent to bring them since a few years including this summer with the exception of the very last few seasons when you pretty much entirely relied on your youth system You save money for years and you splash it out to bring it Beauvue and Valbuena Brilliant choice Glad if you re satisfied with that
Don t forget about Yanga Mbiwa He cost them around 10M if I m not mistaken
So one bad transfer window analyzed after 4 months makes a club badly run K Also splash it out Under 10M combined so David Luiz s left arm That s making it rain
Strong but fair Like a tackle from Puyol
Except the fact that Lyon havent exactly beng doing well in the league have they Lyon dont play PSG every week so cant blame them there same goes to all the other teams Last year Lyon finished 8 points behind PSG in the league with monaco only 4 points behind Lyon That seems like a pretty normal league standing doesnt it Same thing happened with Chelsea last season City finished 8 behind them Would you say Chelsea are ruining the league This Fuck PSG they are ruining the french league circle jerk needs to fuck off Everyone under PSG is under performing compared to last season and thats not PSG s fault is it Monaco have spent a shit load to get to where they are and no one complains about them
Paris under performed a lot in the league last year and they still had 8 points over a team which surprinsingly over performed
So its their fault Got it When Chelsea went undefeated for a massive amount of time last year were they ruining the league The teams under PSG are dropping a lot of points and Lyon has only 7 wins from 14 games Thats half of their games have been dropped points and they are 2nd Like I said just because the rest of the league is under performing isn t PSG s fault Bayern Munich have been very solid in recent years are they ruining the Bundesliga
Why are you bringing up Chelsea and Bayern The point is when a team overwhelmingly dominates financially every other member of the league it s playing in there s obviously no surprise on who s going to win It s like Juve s year in Serie B every other team knew they weren t playing for first place So yeah in a sense you can argue that it s ruining the league because even on match day 1 there s no suspense on who will end up winning
Im bringing up Chelsea and Bayern because they are relatively similar to PSG Bayern have been dominating the bundesliga for years but no one crys about them do they Do they say they are ruining the league What about Chelsea they were undefeated for a good portion of last year and were unchallenged really and have spent a lot compared to other teams but once again no one says they ruin the league So whats with all the PSG hate Ligue 1 teams under PSG are under poerforming and you cant deny that even though you dont mention it at all You can talk about PSG ruining the league but Monaco spent a shit load of money to get to where they are now and like I said just because you spend money doesnt guarantee success you guys were 8 points from them last year and were on top at one point so what there What about when Atletico Madrid won the league They arent exactly even financially when it comes to Madrid Barca are they I dont know where the circle jerk came from but there are so many teams that the same could be said about but PSG seems to get all the shit
Decades of success domestic and European got Bayern there There are about 4 5 different teams in England with financial means comparable to Chelsea s so it s competitive PSG has no competition in the league and got there because some guys decided to invest hundreds of millions in a club How is that fair estimate by Le Parisien of clubs operating budget for this season They spend as much as the next 4 combined how am I supposed to believe we or anybody else can compete
They spend as much as the next 4 combined how am I supposed to believe we or anybody else can compete Because you came within 8 points of them last year Even so it still doesnt explain dropping points in half of your games this year you cant blame you being 11 points behind on PSG you guys are playing poorly Also Man City and Chelsea spend considerably more than other teams bar united but they arent succesful in recent years so its not really competitive between 4 teams then is it
This is inevitably what happens when one team in a league has ambitions to step up to compete at elite level and gets the funds to do so CL has severely distorted national leagues in the last 10 years Even if Lyon or OM were performing as expected they still would be unable to maintain over the course of a season i e look at 14 15 So I can totally see the point of people getting angry about this when it is clear that no other team has the means to challenge
They don t have more ambitions they have a fuckload more money than us
Yeah wanting to win the Champions League and building bit by bit a squad capable of doing it that s not ambition at all
Where did I not say that I hate ambition arguments that fans of massive clubs use to blame other teams for a lack of competition I just meant it s what is to be expected when one team is chosen by the Arabian oil gods to get rich and challenge at a continental level The owners don t give a fuck about the domestic league
You know that s not true if Fournier had any ambitions you wouldn t finish 4th of group H against Valencia Zenit Gent Yes the lack of money is an issue but it s not the only one Ligue 1 teams have recently 5 years underperformed in European Competitions Now PSG became a rich club in Ligue 1 with mostly foreign players and reach quarter finals every year If we had more than 3 French players in the starting squad I don t think we would go far in CL Lyon did poor investments during their mercato You were unlucky to loose F kir but a club can t rely only on one player You kept an average manager who hasn t any European competitions experience I don t see any ambitions at all when I see Lyon picking ex Marseille average footballers or the 2nd choice from Serie A PL
You kept an average manager Who finished second in his first season after taking a team that finished fifth the previous season And you are the epitome of a PSG fan Oh so poor investments why didn t you buy Neymar or Boateng You can afford that We buy fucking second string Serie A and PL players because it s the best we can afford This isn t fucking Football Manager where we can buy some kid from Brazil and expect miracles this is real life I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us
why didn t you buy Neymar or Boateng We buy fucking second string Serie A and PL players because it s the best we can afford Kader Keita 2007 16 Million Ederson 2008 14 million Jean II Makoun 2008 14 million John Mensah 2008 9 million Michel Bastos 2009 18 million Yoann Gourcuff 2010 26 5 million You are the epitome of a OL fan Arrogant pretentious and ignorant T es vraiment un gros gros mais alors un gros de chez gros blaireau toi
come on guys hug it out um marchons marchons
I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us I don t see that happening anytime soon
I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us And then Ligue 1 can go the way of the Eredivisie or the Brasileiro Sure routinely losing your best footballers as soon as they show the slightest bit of potential will hurt the league more than the investment QSI has brought tv package comparable to Germany and not too far off Spain benefiting everyone but at least PSG won t have a lot of money
can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us What a great comment
Woeful league save Zlatan and get him out of there A S A P
That s the most inaccurate comment on Ligue 1 I ve ever seen in here
It s difficult to make any accurate comment when you are being overwhelmed by hormones I mean give the poor guy a break suddenly becoming pubescent is a very unsettling thing in someone s life
Ok without us Ligue 1 Arsenal would be a shit club but whatever
To be fair so would many teams in the Premier League
Especially Newca oh they re already shit
Another flop in the CL and PSG will surely start to lose their financial backing French football is abysmal
French football is abysmal but I m not sure PSG have really flopped in the CL in the past few years We got trampled by Barcelona last year but well who didn t
The year before that they lost to us on away goals and the year before it was Barca also on away goals Hardly flops pretty unlucky in all honesty
And the quarter finals the year before knocked out by a dominant Chelsea
Boring leagueModric s first goal from inside the box with Madrid
luka modric scores me wipes away tear with one hand and fist pumps with the other while silently mouthing my boy
He s just a player that s hard to hate It s crazy to think that If he didn t score that wonder goal vs Manchester Utd a few years ago that he probably would have been sold
My bae
Watching modric score is like watching an angel get its wings
was this his first goal inside the box for real madrid
yes
was the keeper under arrest
Just got my Modric kit in the mail yesterday perfect timing His tempo today was great very good linkup and forward pressing
Lukas first goal in over a year
Fuckin finaly He has so amazing shot and he just never uses it for some reason
Gorgeous finish
Modrulja is best D
Why wasn t that initial pass to Ronaldo offsides Isn t he well past the last defender
deleted
good run beats his defender coming back splits two defenders and puts the ball where only his teammate can get it meanie
You re an idiot

No Ronaldo Assist He should pass more Ronaldo Assist He should pass more Ronaldo single handedly saves the world He should pass more
Ronaldo single handedly saves the world He didn t celebrate with his teammates
deleted
Yeah he should stop saving the world all the time and concentrate on football
I mean it s either assist or no assist right So yeah not gonna be 33 each
He will never be without detractors no matter what he does When you reach the level he has reached you re gonna be under a damn microscope for everything you do I do not envy that sort of pressurePogba is killing us here
Pogba has been going off this game
If people think that was a foul just never watch football again If you can t have those battles then football is a lost cause Otamendi just got beat
Think he was trying too hard to get a foul called
Hard to say from this particular clip to be fair
LOL at Otamendi 2nd awful error against Juve
pretty garbage positioning and looked outmuscled by mandzukic of all people for much of the game
Actually outmuscling defenders and beating them physically in the air and on the ground is an area Mandzukic excels in So it shouldn t come as a surprise that he of all people gives center backs trouble in those situations
I don t see much of Mandzukic so you may be right that he punches above his weight but Ota was totally out of position and will need to do better Mandzukic is smaller than most EPL strikers
6 4 is small for a PL striker nowadays
Google says 6 2 and 185 pounds He s slightly bigger than I thought but shouldn t be outmuscling Otamendi
And Otamendi is 6 and 180 pounds
No but compared to Neymar and Messi and Suarez and Dybala and Aguero he s definitely a stronger striker of all people Strikers aren t usually known for being massive punishers
But center backs are expected to be strong Mandzukic has 5 pounds on suarez who is the same size as otamendi He just ain t that big
Centrebacks are supposed to be strong yeah Everyone s agreeing with you there The reason you re getting downvoted by people is because you used the phrase of all people which implies that Mandzukic is weak compared to other strikers Yeah he might struggle to outstrengthen a lot of center backs but compared to other strikers he ain t weak
The whole game he was getting outmuscled ref bailed him out most of the time though
I really didn t see why he gave half the fouls I cracked up when he gave that last foul against Marchisio still don t get what the ref was thinking XD
That run from Pogba
65 metres according to the french broadcast I was watching
Fuck I forgot about this game why the hell am I watching PSG
Weak defending but cracking cross
Pogba and Sandro have been playing so well recently
Otamendi one of the strongest defenders around complaining about that contact is just laughable
i ve watched every city game he s played and haven t seen anything to suggest he s one of the strongest defenders around or did you not mean physically strong
Not sure if it was a foul by Mandzukic or not but the skill by Pogba and cross by Sandro were both excellent
Could have possibly been a foul but you ve got to expect your center back to be stronger than that
Heh that s exactly what the commentators just said
Does that mean I should be getting paid for this
Can t be worse than the clowns commentating now
Anyone have Pogba s drop on De Bruyne
So happy to see super Mario score
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot to me he s been the best player of the first half Now I just wish Khedira can stay healthy and keep Sturaro off the field
Sturaro was pretty damn good today He recovered so many balls
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot He has been for a while but Allegri is attached to Evra for his consistency and alleged defensive superiority
Pogba running like a gazelle
Great cross Mandatory comment about the coefficient
I think this is the third consecutive assist for Sandro Evra s been good but this guy is just better
what a cross from Sandro
Love Sandro I wish we could have attempted to get him He s been one of the most complete young left backs for a while
Funny that he underperformed in the last season here
Yes Indeed the young man is an excellent footballer
does Pogba ever celebrate
Beautiful cross in Deserved the goal
And sadly Sandro is always on the bench
Doubt he ll be there much from now on though
He got subbed off today to his second consecutive standing ovation from our fans He s definitely making a great case for himself and there s no doubt in my mind that he ll feature quite regularly from now on
great assists 2 games in a row also very solid in defense he s fighting for it
looked quite a bit like Baba s pass to Oscar yesterday Lovely ball
That cross couldn t have been more perfect
Pogba has been amazing so far in this match hoping he scores
I love how quickly goals appear on here
Alex Sandro s cross had eyes
The defense of De Bruyne on Pogba was just horrible He put himself between the ball and the sideline instead of the ball and the door
Great cross What happened to the defender there though
Otamendi choked hard
Mogo si se bacit na glavu
Yyyyyyeeesssss Way to step up mandzukic
What a cross
Makes me miss Darke for world cup games
Vintage poacher Mandzukic
Does Otamendi think he is Ronaldo
Great cross from pogba sandrp pogba is looking good so far in this match
Pogba didn t cross it The commentator even said Alex Sandro as he crossed the ball
Ohh corrected it thanks

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsI expect Chelsea to improve marginally I have trouble seeing where the magic fairly dust that turns the clock back to last season comes from
You are what your record says you are Mahatma Ghandi
If you think I ve been unfair in mocking the Blues here s a neutral version to share with your Chelsea supporting friends https drive google com file d 0B ZcVoqtapgRNC1kT1RvbEZSYUk view usp sharing edit to add ugh does not display well in Sheets You ll have to use Excel
Hadn t planned on it but it should be easy Only problem is I don t know which supporters to pick on in other leagues p
If you beat Spurs this week I ll eat my hat Unrelated note I wear pizza as headgear
In isolation yeah catch any one of the teams ahead of you is plausible Catching all 11 of the teams in between Chelsea and 4th place well This seems beyond your grasp though I also give up p
This I agree with If the cups go toward the big fish Chelsea may well nick the EL Or if they win a cup themselves
Now that s a hot take
A lot of time and matches remain and Spurs still are a Harry Kane ACL away from a serious problem don t count your cockerels before they hatch
spits in hand offers to shake
The math nerds Ok Michael Caley and whoever does stats com put 4th on around 66 points the average is around 68 There s a lot of compression at the top since the appointed breakaway pack some subset of United City and or Arsenal has thus far refused to breakaway Plus also the computers are positively glitchy about Leicester They still have a lot of but it s Leicester in the model The models tend to weigh the previous seasons results and lessens it over time as the current season s results are factored in Frankly I don t trust the models regarding 4th place so I m inclined to agree with you If Leicester is s posed to be lower on the table that means that they points they do have have taken away from the other top clubs Gross oversimplifcation just happened So maybe we ll see a lower 4th place point total For reference the lowest in the 20 team era is 60 and the highest is 79
I ll take that bet if Chelsea do make the top 4 I ll eat a very spicy taco
I ll take a bet on either if you want
Or to put the Chelsea question in isolation What is your over under on total points for Chelsea this season
We ll see I like Everton to go on a tear I haven t watch enough Southampton to rule out a run and yeah West Ham is probably at their highwater mark If I were a betting man I d take the following clubs to finish higher than Chelsea Arsenal Man City Man United Spurs Liverpool Everton and yes Leicester Which four of those am I wrong on p And I have a newsflash Chelsea s not winning on Sunday p
It matters a lot because Chelsea is not the only candidate to make a huge run from the middlebottom of the table Everton looks good Liverpool looks good Southampton is well they may or may not come good it s hard to tell It does Chelsea no good to go on a massive run and achieve 68 points if 4th place is now 70 because someone got a hot hand 68 is not the finish line it s just a statistical point where half the 4th place team finished ahead of it kind of You are betting on Leicester falling back AND Spurs AND Everton AND Southampton AND Liverpool AND even the Hammers sure why not all dropping so many more points while Chelsea performs at last year s level suddenly and without any sort of reason to believe other than well belief I mean support your club and all but well yeah
Some other interesting things besides Chelsea p The bar gets even lower if 6th or even 7th are in the mix if the cups fall to high placed teams then the doors are open for Europa Everyone thinks Leicester will fall back to earth but I still like them for Europe Yes they have a daunting run to finish the front half but that just means they also have 13 matches reversed fixtures in their future where they glorped up 28 points on the first pass If they have another 25 28 points in them plus a few more around 7 9 from murderers row they can make 63 And if the top finishers get the cups they won t even need that many Leicester on Thursday nights What a world From West Ham to around Stoke if any of those teams go on a surge they are suddenly in play for nicking the last CL or the top EL spot It s wide open a few unexpected wins here or there Aston Villa are in deep shit DEEEEP shit They have 5 points in 13 matches 0 38 ppm They need to be more than 3 times better to get their nose into clean air I wonder what the lowest points after 13 matches that didn t get relegated was
Which is why I included the 80 target The math nerds on twitter agree that the champ this season might not make 80 whoever they are
I had that in but I dropped it maybe I should in future editions
Man City had one team to catch That team stumbled and City ran them down Chelsea has to eclipse 11 teams of 14 teams to claim fourth Sure they have almost 4 times as long to catch them as City did United but it s just too many clubs Plus they ve shown nothing on the pitch thus far that indicates there are a hair from making the switch from 1ppm to more than 2 1 ppm
I think it s sort of mad to consider it but if Chelsea can average 2 1 points per match for the rest of the way they ll have earned it no doubt
HHHHRRRGGGGAAAAHHHHH Oh sorry had a nightmare there for a second
I want Dembele with Dier maybe not as dynamic going forward although I think he s starting to get the value of passing forward p but Dembele is as smooth as butter on the ball and denying Chelsea a whiff of any takeaways up the pitch is quite valuable On Sunday I prefer Hugo Kyle Toby Jan Danny Mousa Eric Erik Christian Heung Min Harry It s not as dynamic as other options but it s stone cold hard defensively with enough up front to get the requisite 2 goals
Bah they were better than Norwich and Maccabi Tel Aviv Forgive me if Chelsea squashing bugs doesn t exactly fill me with dread When they ve played teams with some talent lately Loss to Stoke Loss to Liverpool Loss to Stoke on pens Loss to West Ham During that same span they got a win and a draw against Dinamo Kiev scoring a grand total of one goalibrahimovic substitution

Pique would have done the calma calma then the siiiiiiii celebration and then he would have spent the last minutes with his right hand opened to show the manita
CamaradonaAhh thanks Your connection helped me find this The use of grass as British slang for a police informer dates back to the 1930s and is apparently a short form of the slang term grasshopper meaning the same thing Grasshopper itself is rhyming slang for either copper i e a police officer or shopper one who shops sells information to the police
You can hover over a crest to see the team name
It s no surprise that Sandro getting more regular minutes has coincided with Mandzukic looking more dangerous He could prove to be an important striker for us this season
What does grass mean when used in this context
Omar s version including Pogba wrecking De Bruyne https streamable com 774n
Unfortunately not
Probably his best performance of the season
The people who say that are those who have only seen the Vines
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot He has been for a while but Allegri is attached to Evra for his consistency and alleged defensive superiority
That was headed for the corner flag
Oh come on put this game to bed already
Lo stile Juve
Bit selfish from Morata there He did the hard work but if he passes to Dybala there the game is over And right off the back if that Sterling nearly scores at the other end
To be fair he doesn t need to work on his attacking game too much to reach Gattuso s level
On loan though your point still stands
Yep we play it after every goal at home
It was
Sounds like it s the only game you ve ever seen
Morata nearly gifted them a goalscoring opportunity there
Come on Mandzu
Haha can t blame you for trying Barza

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsBeating Barca and Madrid was about the only noteworthy thing they did this season They ve been poor in the league too
saw today how good they can be What you mean go down by 4 goals Conceeding 3 goals in 10 minutes is much more indictative about how bad Madrid s defense is rather than how good Shakhtar is Especially considering the fact that Madrid have conceeded 10 goals in their last 3 games
That s becasue the whole league was affected by the war
Or maybe how the players are affected by the war You think it s a coincidence how many Brazilians are leaving the team They re afaird for a reason you know They had to fucking move stadiums and the club s owners are running out of cash to support the teams
I mentioned Ronaldo because the guy I was replying to talked about Ronaldo
lol Portugal and Netherlands
A win by BATE could send them through the R16 IMO Roma and Bayer have been shockingly poor this year I expected a lot better from them
I m not pinning it on anybody
Mate this is against a team in a war torn country He has dissappeared in all the big games this year Atletico Sevilla PSG Barca
lol these English commentators Sagna clearly got Dybala on the foot
Well upon future research it appears they went to Budapest instead of Bucharest and the final was in Bucharest Other than that it s true
If they re gonna rotate then why even start Ronaldo He needs the rest the most
I remember when this huge group of Athletic fans flew to Bucharest for the EL final Except that the final was in Budapest
all that means is that Bayern is a team full of chokers
UEFALONA
Youth development If Sergi Roberto and Rafinha can turn into world class players and he wins us another CL then I d rate him over Pep
Holy shit Barca s wage structure is out of control I really hope that Iniesta is the second dot and not Neymar or else we re gonna be in big trouble in thre coming years
Who s the outlier for United I know for Barca it s probably Messi Neymar and for Madrid it s Ronaldo but who s earning that much for United Rooney
Isn t Ribery still injured
Yeah just support Columbus then If you re looking for an European team just pick some team from the top leagues Spain Germany England Spain is perfect because the kickoff times aren t so damn early in the morning Go research stuff on Wikipedia and watch some La Liga games to decide Laola1 tv has free streams if you can get a German IP

He just seems like a nice guy And I had hopes he could come good for us after his bad spell
We definitely do He was our only attacking midfielder that actually made runs in behind the defence and had a strikers instinst And he was an excellent finisher

Alves has had five great months of play in the past two years terrible from 2013 to mid January 2015 then he played to a world class level going into the Copa Am rica and his defending has been bad this season Only reason why he is still at Bar a is because they couldn t sign anyone else otherwise he would have left in January
cba watching the rest of this game i literally just saw Kobe brick an open fadeaway with 4 22 left in the third quarter and then Ezeli scored an alley oop 9 seconds later

To make a point that the BBCJK can t all play
Exactly Its either a sabotage by Benitez so Perez stops interfering with tactics or its a sabotage by the players to get Benitez sacked Otherwise there s just no way any top team uses such a bad formation Even the most casual fan would notice something is terribly wrong
Bale Benzema Cristiano James Kroos
Aye
Did you hear about their line up in the game against Sevilla CDPRNMCKIBC
I find it hard to believe he did that s one strategy for taking the midfield battle out of the game s
That is some Moyes level failure right there
Surrendering the midfield from the start Bold move Let s see how it works for them Oh right Well then
Its perfect for Barca
This hurts to look at Still baffled how we went from an organized defensive team to that Sure its against the best team in the world right now but what a poor performance and utter lack of focus and organization Hope we can do better at the camp nou
Describing Madrid s formation
I can t understand how when real is attacking in possession Ronaldo Benzema and sometimes a third player are all within a radius of 4m of each other When on top of the above there is no one between the forwards and midfield defenders lines I am surprised they can still score as many goals as they do In fact they were already doing this last year with Ancelotti and Rafa just made it worse

Exactly That wouldn t fly even in lower divisions
I didn t watch the game but this is just a snapshot isn t it I cant see that the team remained in that shape all game Surely
A team should never stand like that against a top tier team
aahh the good ol charcoal formation
Shoutout to Hennessy for the graphic
If I recall correctly in the early chapters of Tsubasa their rivals did this strat and it was effective I dont know what went wrong there
It reminds me of how we would sometimes end up looking under Moyes
poor benitez he came to italy and totally forgot how to football
Ah the classic 4 2 4 wide formation with Kroos and Modric as CBs
James such a good midfielder though right
He is He was one of the few players that were somewhat carrying real
I mean Barca were going to dominate the midfield anyway In some ways it is a good idea to not waste players by trying to compete with them in there
Because they re good you decide to give them more space
Modric Kroos James
How long will barcelona fans drag this out
About as long as that gap in your midfield
bravo just bravo
Great keeper
Had probably his best performance for Barca yet
I refuse to take anything seriously a Liverpool supporter says
Yes because the fact that he supports a lesser team than yours means his opinion doesn t matter
Bet you have lots of friends

You just didI hope we will see a worthy clash between barca and bayern at their best
i don t think bayern will ever have robben and ribery on the pitch together again but those 2 being on the pitch might not even be their best team at this point
Costa is better than Ribery anyway
No he s not This is such a stupid thing to say
Not that I necessarily agree with him but Costa has been amazing
yeah but Robbery is a nightmare to play against
R bben is better
No Robbery is better because they steal points And in hindsight 49M total for that striking power is a steal too
of course he is He has been playing just as good as prime Ribery since he got to Bayern Current Ribery wouldn t get off the bench with Costa on his current form
just as good as prime Ribery What s it like having a memory span of one year
It proves that right now Costa appears to be the more productive choice Ribery has lost a step it happens to all players eventually
Ribery has lost a step Ribery was absolutely bonkers last season And no one knows if he lost a step because of his current injury He will return soon Maybe already in 3 weeks
The point I m debating was that as of yet Costa is not better than Ribery in his prime Perhaps better than Ribery now
Ribery has never had this much impact in his career
Had 7 assists and 5 goals in the small handful of matches he actually played last season Bundesliga specifically You have to be trolling
Cool random stats
Oh god please leave
that s my point everyone was pissed that bayern were missing ribery and robben against barca now it doesn t matter
Well Robben is important they are much more dangerous with him Ribery isn t
this would be amazing
There s not much between both teams just now Barca have been excellent for a few matches but Bayern have been consistently excellent At the same time it feels like Barcelona have done their homework and ironed out their early season problems The extra motivation might give Bayern the edge too after Barcelona beat them last year
and then there s the fucking almighty augsburg

Verstehe ich nicht was meinst damit
It s a popular song from an old german kids theatre from Augsburg that was very popular in the TV and it s the goal song of the FC Augsburg We also don t give a wimpel before the game but a puppet from that theatre Lovely club that one
Been to the puppenkiste museum last year after going to the christmas market Had to rewatch Urmel aus dem Eis and Bill Bo after that
I went three years ago with my little brother my then still alive grandmother and my mother Damn that was a lovely day was so close to buy a fully fledged Jim the Lokf hrer puppet for 70 And the only time I have seen a professional footballer was Bobadilla a fewe weeks later getting drunk on the christmas market Good times I miss that city so much
Every time there s a discussion about Augsburg on this subreddit or r borussiadortmund I can count on you being there Why did you leave
Why did I leave what
Augsburg You talk about it so fondly that I m curious about what led to you moving away
I finished my bachelors the masters there was not for me and most people that made that place what it was for me left So I wanted to see how much I like other places Turns out that I wasn t imagening it when I thought that those four years where the best time I will ever have And I will always remember it fondly Maybe even move back there one day who knows Augsburg shouldn T go below second league though that s a requiremend
Jim Button and Lukas the Train Conductor to be precise
Wtf were we doing
Should ve never won that game to begin with
8 different formations
Gotta keep the lads entertained and aware would be boring otherwise

So glad we play there at the end of the season
Everyone has to visit the dentist
And no one enjoys it Except for Augsburg
Well Augsburg did lose in the last minute so they might not have enjoyed it that much
The dentist was nice to them for the whole trip and then he just ripped out the tooth They were definitely in pain
We didn t enjoy the wrong penalty call But we enjoyed the match
I m with you on that Hate winning that way would ve rather taken a draw against The Parked Buss of Augsburg
Just wait until Mainz makes Bayern look like a bunch of amateurs yet again
Like they often do Fucking Mainz
I dont know much of the german league why other teams are not even close is about resources why is Bayern in a different league than the rest of the teams
Bayern right now would comfortably whoop every other league aside from La Liga They have a gulf of talent across world football not just their own league
Bayern are not all that much better than the top teams in spain england italy or psg ON THEIR DAY The thing is that bayern are so consistent comparatively They have been making far fewer mistakes than the other top teams in europe
Consistency is what seperates the best from the rest Arsenal can beat Bayern on their day and we do but we d get battered 4 times out of 6
Correct That it what i just said
And I m just pointing out why that makes them much better than the top teams in England Italy PSG
Fair enough i guess i just thought i portrayed that when i said ON THEIR DAY We agree then Consistency separates them Cheers
Yeah ressources Bayern can compete with the best because of ridiculously good marketing TV money is a joke compared to Spain or even England I would wager that Suarez Neymar and Messi make more money than all of Borussia Dortmund first eleven combined
There s not much TV money spread around the league but Bayern has done well to market to supporters globally that other teams haven t gotten close to Having an amazingly consistent success rate in recent years and having some of the most famous NT players certainly helps the appeal Bayern also has been incredible well managed and received consistent growth where other German clubs squandered their potential in the past Lastly once Bayern solidified their place in the top clubs worldwide the income was solidified as well causing further gap in the BL
Holy mother of fuck
Their home record in the CL is even more impressing
Pep likes his funky formations
And that s why I hope that if we meet Madrid or Barca in the CL before the final it will be a home game first as opposed to an away game
Why where there 24 more seats on the first 2 matches
Corporate boxes probably
Curious to see if they can keep it up when Europe s elite come visiting
Barcelona Arsenal Dortmund
When did they meet Barca this season And Arsenal and Dortmund aren t part of Europe s elite anymore
Hey now
Dortmund especially this season are better than most teams in the CL regardless it d be deluded to say otherwise
Might get far in the EL true
Oh whoops I thought I was on the post about our last 9 home CL games
Yeah Well to be honest neither is Ajax if Arsenal is not sorry I actually love Ajax
Ajax hasn t been part of the European elite for nearly 15 years now maybe longer Money talks
For me Ajax is not in European elite this season But they are usually I usually have high expectations from Ajax because I love Ajax very merry much
he s right they haven t been a mighty European side for a long time last time they got to QF of UCL is 2002 03
Yeah I know I still do not want to admit it

One team league
Zagreb 5 0 Arsenal 5 1 Olympiacos 4 0
One team league
One team group
Two team continent
Two team world
3 team universe The monstars
I think he meant that Bayern are so good that no other teams can match them But its the same circle jerk bullshit that people are taking shit about PSG and as a Celtic fan I hear it plenty too
Don t see what that has to do with his comment
one team league multiple leagues
Ok makes sense I guess I just think u vaginawishbone was trying to say that the Bundesliga is a one team league I ll let you decide if it is or not
YupIsn t up yet

Deutsch ist manchmal auch in Deutschland selbst eine schwere Sprache Immer weiter so
Aktuell schwer Wird sich aber auch bei mir wieder legen liegt wohl daran dass ich vor einigen Monaten selbst in Paris war und die Dinge die ich dort als sch n in Erinnerung habe jetzt einen dunklen Unterton bekommen Es ist nicht wirklich Angst im eigentlichen Sinne sondern viel mehr Wut und Trauer
Krass Find s halt brutal wie der Terror jetzt auch Deutschland erreicht Vor allem so wie du s erz hlst Ich hab mich aber auch brutalst mit dem Thema auseinander gesetzt Der Mensch f hlt sich halt zu dem was ihn ver ngstigt hingezogen Darum hab ich viel zu viel ber Paris gelesen und auch gesehen
Wie geht s euch eigentlich so nach den Paris Anschl gen und der Evakuierung in Hannover Habt ihr Angst Ehrlich gesagt w rde ich l gen wenn ich sagen w rde dass das alles bei mir nichts ausl st Versp re schon etwas Angst um da mal bei der Wahrheit zu bleiben Andererseits sollte man sich solidarisch und die Terroristen nicht gewinnen lassen aber das f llt mir aktuell schwer

Bayern or Barcelona the one with the less injuries

They sold their best players while offering new expansive contracts to average players and they built a new expansive stadium who is not profitable

Felix Brych is such a terrible referee woeful calls all across the game Edit Every fucking year as well God fucking damnit

Anybody have any idea what s going on with Hart
Feeling a red card coming The players are getting fed up with it all
Unable to go back since I m relying on other people s streams Normally I would be able to go back into the match to grab that for you but now tonight Sorry mate

Maybe try selecting a role for him in that position that s what I do So instead of CM Playing position select CM Central Midfielder That s what I do when I want to re train my player and it seems to help
He s still at United in 2018 in my save Getting decent amount of apps but not a key player United did buy Kane in their first season so they play him instead
Getting no yellows is pretty difficult thing to do Your players will make tactical fouls and or lose their head and make rash challenges It s pretty much impossible to not get carded at least once in a game
Can I see your squad I m currently playing with Gent and I m only in 2018 so I m still struggling a bit
Get Zabaleta
HOLY SHIT BOYS THEY DID IT Belgium is proud of you
Pretty fucking stupid that two four steps are guarded
That first minute red card though
Probably Pardew
Fuck I didn t get Bolasie s skill that lost him the ball in itreally interesting read I didn t know about van Gaal breaking his leg
I love how he done it
That s somehow so very van Gaal to suddenly take up pole vaulting as a hobby
Great article Thanks for sharing
Injuries suck so much
Grear read funny to see all of the coindicences
TIL
Season cut Shaw t Fucking excellent hahaShame he wasted his career winning everything with Barcelona he could have taken us to Championship glory
He would certainly have added strength to our sub s bench
Sure he d have got into a midfield of Nicky Bailey and Kevin Thompson
He never proved himself in the Champ but neither did Kev who was always injured Bailey was alright Robson was the real guy to displace
Always had a soft spot for Tarmo Kink Should ve kept him just for advertising Parmo s
Loved Kink remember him scoring a double against Burnley shortly after we got him very decent player
I fucking love it when Estonian players get praise
The Estonian Exocet What a left foot Shame he was so incredibly hit or miss
Mate he s the Tallin Torpedo Remember one match after he scored his first screamer for the club he came on in the last few minutes literally everyone in the stands was saying he would fire one in from range What did he go and do fire one in from range
Thomson is a quality player would have done a lot if not for horrible injuries
Spent his career at a team who couldn t even dream of winning the Football League Championship Shame indeed
Heres some quotes from the article that this article is referencing Xavi is a genuine football fanatic I interview players all the time You and Jamie Carragher are the biggest football addicts I have met I met Carragher on a beach in Ibiza when we were on holiday What did you talk about Football He s a good guy a fanatic You can see that He came back to Spain to interview me I bet I could ask you about lower level teams in Spain and you d know Ibiza from the second division Ibiza are now in the third Barakaldo a tiny Basque team with a beautiful stadium They re leader of one of the four Segunda B leagues Look shows his phone I read about all the leagues every day Alaves Near the top of the second Gaizka Toquero has got five goals so far Huesca Near the bottom of the second Regional fourth division club San Andreu Mid table Started well I have friends at these clubs I follow how they do Cornella who play next to Espanyol is another I follow the Belgian second division because there are players from the Aspire Academy there What about lower level English football I follow Middlesbrough because Aitor Karanka is there Brighton are top of their league I met a boy the other day English He was wearing a Barca shirt but I asked him who he supported He said Sheffield United I know them they have 20 000 fans in the third division That s incredible You get that in England I watched some of a game with Charlton the other day There was football on television yet the stadium was packed with supporters Incredible If that was in Catalonia Olot vs Reus then there were would be a few people there and the families of the players Heres a link to the full article
Xavi s wife must be so fed up with him
well actually When I have time I d love to do the same but I think my wife would kill me Can you imagine OK you stay with the baby for three days while I go and watch Liverpool against Everton
haha he said it because he talked about Luis Enrique before he became a trainer that he used to go and watch teams and he used to wear a scarf so he was not recognized
that sounds awesome wish i had the money to travel around europe watching all the best derbies out there
Didn t he break up with his previous girlfriend and basically say well at least I can finally watch all the football I want
Xavi didn t date anyone for a while in order to be free from distraction and focus on football
Xavi and Carra seem like such an unusual combination Hopefully they both find their way into management at some point
Imagine carra trying out a bit of Spanish with a scouse accent
Me yamo carra
Sounds good to me
I ve heard it It s not so bad The real odd one was a very strong Welsh accent combined with near fluent Spanish of the Spain variety It was quite odd To be fair both were better than Chileans haha
You re basically describing what Angel Rangel is going to be like at the end of his career
Joint managers of Catalunya
El Clasico 2035 Xavi in charge of Barca vs Carragher in charge of Madrid
So knowledgeable What a guy imagine he ends up coaching Middlesborough
i m not sure my heart could take the pride
Holy shit how does he have so much time to follow all these leagues amazing Can t wait to see him training Barca some day I hope Lucho stays until Xavi arrives
What else does he have to do Footbalers are usually free most if the day after they finish training
I mean I imagine that after a long day of doing nothing but playing thinking about football and fitness you might want to do something non football related Like go mushroom hunting
It sounds like he just looks at the tables and reads articles
Yes I watch a lot of football Madrid are very strong this season They have a different philosophy to Barca They work a lot on their defence Rafa Benitez has improved that snigger
What s the Aspire Academy
Qatari football factory Foreigners go in NT players come out
That s by far the best definition for it African and Asian players training to make it into the 2022 Qatari NT
Football academy in Qatar where Xavi is studying
Best football academy in Qatar IIRC
I m Mallorquin and I didnt even know Ibiza got relegated
What a legend I miss him so much
That is such an incredible interview I wish there would be more revealing interviews like this where we get to read about player s experience in historical events and their insights towards football in general and certain players in particular
Brighton are top of their league INCORRECT Clearly Xavi knows nothing about football
they Sheffield Utd have 20 000 fans in the third division That s incredible You get that in England I watched some of a game with Charlton the other day There was football on television yet the stadium was packed with supporters Incredible If that was in Catalonia Olot vs Reus then there were would be a few people there and the families of the players How can anybody say English football has no identity
huh who said that
Vicente Del Bosque
Totally out of context He wasn t talking about the fans at all He was talking about the English way of playing football vs the Italian Spanish insert any country here s way of playing football And he s right Those times when you could recognize the nationality of a team by the way they played is over Take Arsenal and Chelsea for instance Totally opposite ways of playing yet in the same league There s no English Spanish or Italian identity in terms of playing anymore or at least that identity is getting much more vague
Take Barcelona and Atleti and you have the same disparity in play style
Absolutely yes Which is precisely my point
Pretty sure he was talking about the style teams play with when he said that
In what context
He s a cretin
What a glory hunter
Dags and Red or nuffin m8
Xavi should come help us out so those 20k fan aren t pissed because we lose 4 2 at home to fucking Shrewsbury Town Fuck
Big Nigel s doing a fantastic job
Curse of the Nigels To be fair it can t just be him We ve got a massive squad full of crap bought for a lot of money Our entire behind the scenes finance board is very opaque so no one has any idea who s actually making the final decisions on stuff I m pretty depressed seeing you lot doing so well too Football s pretty shit right now
What s happening with McGahey
Sent on loan to Tranmere God knows why our whole defence is shit might as well give him a try
What about Che Adams and Louis Reed Your squad is full of young talent sorry if I m kind of rubbing it in at the moment
Adams got injured and is finding his feet again Reed was one of the offenders last night got subbed at half time Both are really talented though Reed seems to have become a bit too relied upon for my liking though it s a fair bit of pressure for him especially when the others in midfield aren t playing well
Xavi s just trying to get in the next Sean Bean movie
LORD OF THE GRASS
Not surprised to hear him say this always thought he had his head screwed on right
He would have been dead proud of United s fans last night singing your not fit to wear the shirt 40 minutes in
The Lane s not the happiest at the moment
I can understand why you would have been promoted by now if you kept Danny Wilson
I was behind Wilson got some unnecessary stick off the fans C est la vie
Will be even more impressive next season when we re drawing 20k in the fourth division
The more I read about Xavi the more I like him He seems like such a nice guy
He is a genuine football fanatic follows third division teams all over the world I can t wait until he coaches his first team I think it s inevitable that he will become a coach
let s hope so his football brain is immense
Which is crazy to think how smart Lahm must be then Pep worked with both and made a huge point how smart Lahm was
Let s hope he successfully managed a first division team
Obviously I hope he coaches Barca one day
Mhm I m just nervous cause sometimes highly successful ex players turned managers due fairly poorly
He seems nice a good leader but from what I ve seen he also seems like a sore loser
Ferguson always scouted for the sorest of sore losers they were the ones that fought the hardest on the field
you re really determined not to find fault in Xavi lol
heh not really I m just trying to point out that for many football players their biggest asset is that they are sore losers
Except even among the realm of top class footballers Xavi is noticed as being a sore loser So it cant be that
So is Mourinho So is Ronaldo Are you saying this because of the grass length comments he d make
Not that nice a guy https www reddit com r soccer comments 3bfwxk xavi qatar has conditions for great world cup
I m just saying if someone gave me millions I too would blindly praise them for everything
yeah but you probably aren t already a multi millionair
But they can get good infrastructure due to money
Really He s said and done a lot of things recently to put me off him
really s top lad
What a football nerrrrrrd one of us
I m sure he writes for Zonal Marking under a pseudonym
Why is Xavi such a cool guy
Xavi is the ultimate hipster
Would he be impressed by this blavdes fan https twitter com Oddschanger status 669531006769213441
Xavi is a fantastic player and genuine football fanatic but I must say the whole Qatar ambassador thing is very disappointing and on the same note Barcelona s Qatar Airways deal is quite depressing as well
Have to think that Juninho and Ravenelli had something to do with that
Great Another what Xavi said post
Too much Xavi last days
Xavi to Middlesbrough confirmed
Mate he wouldn t make it into our midfield
Who needs Xavi with Big Grant bossing it
Banned for Huddersfield though isn t he I suppose we can arrange a tryout deal for this Xavi guy
Oh no you ll really struggle to beat us now s
Poor man s Adam Clayton
Fuck it we ll have him
Middlesborough Never heard of them Except something about a tragedy involving Liverpool fans
Oh you re painfully American I get it
What
Wow you re thick as fuck

Much credit to Bale for Cristiano s goal
Guys how s Kovacic been so far in this game
Kovacic himself said he s much better as a DM than as a offensiv midfielder higher up on the field Don t really think he ll be a success in the game
Alternative Angle
Alternative Angle
Wake me up the day Cristiano do the same for BaleHe s back guys He didn t rapidly decline die or some other shit He s okay
He didn t want to score till Messi started scoring
I miss Messi its not fair if hes out injured and I keep scoring Ill just lay low for a bit until he s back
The Kneejerk is real
He was briefly less than superhuman but even that was scary enough for him to get back to form
He obviously did decline but since the last game found the fountain of youth He s getting better so must have reversed the ageing process it s the only explanation I mean that maybe a few bad games happens to everyone and just because you re over 29 doesn t mean a few bad games means the end of your career
I still think he s declining

He d have about 6 inches of height over him that s not even a debate
Messi is 5 7 Cr7 is 6 1 6 inches your math checks out
he s the all time top scorer in the champions league without penalties most goals in a season is also his without penalties i imagine there could be at least one more but those two i m rather positive about

Motivated Are they just appending random words to the ends of these tweets now
That has been opta thing from the get go
They usually use words that actually have relevance to what the stat is about But motivated seems like it was just randomly chosen
Not really in the news today it was reported he d promised to work harder etc in the team meeting after the Clasico so obviously they are going with the idea that Real are extra motivated for today s game after Saturday s embarrassment
Only Benzema Ozil and Di Maria have assisted Cristiano more than Bale
OptaJose 2015 11 25 20 38 UTC 21 Gareth Bale has assisted in Cristiano s 21 goals only three players did it more times Benzema 31 zil 27 and Di Mar a 22 Duet This message was created by a bot Contact creator Source code
Reports of his demise have been greatly exaggerated
Mate this is against a team in a war torn country He has dissappeared in all the big games this year Atletico Sevilla PSG Barca
what the hell does war torn have to do with it You realize that the game today was played in Lviv a city on the complete opposite end of the country from where the conflict is taking place right Ukraine is a very big country It s not like they had to worry about bombs being dropped on the stadium It s amazing how far people go to discredit Ronaldo s achievements
Or maybe how the players are affected by the war You think it s a coincidence how many Brazilians are leaving the team They re afaird for a reason you know They had to fucking move stadiums and the club s owners are running out of cash to support the teams
It didnt affect them in the Ukrainian league they have only dropped something like 2 points since August
That s becasue the whole league was affected by the war

I think you are being ignorant and unfair towards Shakhtar They are extremely strong at home and its incredibly difficult to beat them Many big teams in last few years have been unable to do that And we saw that today how good they can be
saw today how good they can be What you mean go down by 4 goals Conceeding 3 goals in 10 minutes is much more indictative about how bad Madrid s defense is rather than how good Shakhtar is Especially considering the fact that Madrid have conceeded 10 goals in their last 3 games
Doesn t change the fact that shakhtar are good at home
so did the team don t pin it on one player
He s not pinning it on one player Ronaldo played shit in all of those games not talking about the rest of the team
Ronaldo played shit but so did Bale Kroos Ramos Benzema etc are they all fastly declining too
No because you don t usually decline as a 26 27 year old top level player Ronaldo is nearly 31 and when he plays bad he essentially isn t there
what does age have to do with it if anything it s his knee problem that has limited his dribbling compared to the past but Ronaldo didn t go from scoring 66 goals and getting 22 assists last season to becoming useless this season in the space of 3 months even when he is playing like shit he can still give chances for teammates and create space for others with his movement just because he isn t dribbling past multiple players it doesn t mean he isn t doing anything useful the only problem this season has been that he is isolated as striker and his finishing has been bad also factor that his teammates have been invisible in most big matches too
Age has a lot to do with it come on I know that Ronaldo is a crazy fit guy but sooner rather than later later his physicality will decline Also 61 goals and 21 assists Also Declining being useless ffs It means he s not playing to his standards He s been realtively worse even in his worse form than he was before
yes in 2 or 3 years he will no longer be RM quality but as of now he is definitely good enough to make a difference in any match as long as everyone around him doesn t disappear like against Sevilla and Barca I get what you re trying to say though but it came across as you calling him useless in the original comment by saying essentially isn t there
15 goals in 17 games this season while having a short run of his worst form in years Not to mention the entire team has been playing like crap and there have been an endless amount of injuries Must be tough to life up to your peoples standards
How many games has he scored in And name the teams Ronaldo plays well when the whole team plays well and sometimes he plays bad when the team aren t up to it
15 goals in 17 games is still a record 99 of players want to have at the top level
I m not pinning it on anybody
He has dissappeared in all the big games You re making it sound like his team is playing great but he s letting them down or some shit
I mentioned Ronaldo because the guy I was replying to talked about Ronaldo
they are actually in some damn good form if you actually take into consideration their form but hey fuck that
deleted
I think i understand that part doesn t change the fact that they re playing very good
the boy is growing up
Eh Wrong I think I seem to remember him getting 2 assists away at Schalke in 2014
In the 6 1 win no Cristiano had 2 goals and 1 assist Bale 2 goals and 1 assist Benzema 2 goals and 2 assists and Ramos one assist

I hope we do renew his contract Best destroyer in the world
does he even play that much
He s still a starter although he doesn t play midfield under Pep
He did yesterday I hope it becomes more routine It probably will considering Boateng Benatia and Badstuber are all healthy
It will I think a lot of the stuff the fans see Pep also sees It s why I like him He knows what needs to be done and he does it He s smart about it though He doesn t rush into things He wants to make sure that the players are all healthy before he makes moves again He moved Lahm to RB and he ll move Martinez to CDM again Martinez is regaining confidence though When he first came back he was definitely not ready to play in the midfield He looked afraid to dribble He ll get there though
Typically Bayern managers have fallen into two archetypes pragmatic and not idealistic idealistic and not pragmatic Not to say I don t appreciate them but Klinsmann and Van Gaal fell into the former while Rehhaggel Trappatoni Hitzfeld fell into the latter In his last stint Heynckes was the first manager in a long time to maintain a sense of style whilst tweaking the philosophy to achieve the best results The more you look at Heynckes career as a player and a manager the more remarkable it becomes and I ve never even been a zealous admirer of him He went from stubborn Osram to a man who adapted and changed at an old age That kind of transformation is seen rarely in anyone especially not one as decorated as him And I think Pep has really taken cues from that Yes Guardiola is highly intelligent and he wants to win more than anything But let s be real here he s always been an idealist and it s hard to imagine him ever abandoning a possession system and playing like stoke But it s year 3 and he is still constantly modifying his starting XI and tactics because a for rotation and b because he knows that the best results have not been achieved yet and he ll keep searching for the best tactic for his team I hope he signs that fucking contract or imma kill him
Well that took a dark turn at the end
How s Badstuber doing these days
He just got back from injury got subbed in against Stuttgart two weeks ago Was in the starting XI against Olympiacos yesterday and got a red card Not really a justified red card in my opinion but I m biased so you gotta decide for yourself
Just got back from injury
Didn t get to watch the second half how d he look in midfield
Couldn t really tell the match wasn t hard at all so he got to coast pretty much
He s no2 CB with Boateng And plays over Benatia
Benatia and him rotate although he s recently been starting more often over him probably due to form injury issues I guess you can say they re kinda joint starters it s just that neither of them is clear cut above the other Kinda like MaTS and Bravo at Barca except Javi and Benatia aren t exclusively alternated between the league and the cup
And Badstuber is still injured Who will move on first
Badstuber played yesterday Not the entire game though since he got a red after an hour
since he got a red after an hour I like to call that one a substitution with a handicap to even the playing field
Ya to be honest though it was a fitness problem with Badstuber He wasn t as fast as he should have been and the guy went down and he got sent off
Badstuber was never fast
it s just that neither of them is clear cut above the other I d say Martinez is easily a cut above Benatia which doesnt come as a surprise because the latter didn t have much chance to play with the team for a longer period without injuries
It s hard to say Bayern haven t had four fit CBs for more than a handful of games under Pep and its usually closer to two Between Benatia Badstuber and Martinez it s usually a safe bet that 1 2 of them are injured at any given time At the start of this season all three were actually injured and Boateng played the entire defense himself and in one game was subbed out leaving just Xabi to cover the entire back line The most you can say is that Boateng is a permanent fixture His partner or two depending on whether it s a 3 or 4 man backline varies a lot He could be paired with any of the three other CBs or even Alaba and Rafinha who sometimes play as makeshift CBs too Pep is all about that flexibility
They have to keep him he was insanely good when they won the CL Just needs to stay healthy for a while
If they could start him in the midfield that would be greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
Yeah I would so love to see a midfield of Martinez Vidal Thiago
Pep please
more like Thagio please
Bist du besoffen Deine komplette comment history schaut so aus als ob ein 14 j hriger dies alles geschrieben h tte
Der ist leider immer so
I can t even imagine the conniption Athletic fans have whenever they pop on a Bayern CL match to check in on Javi and he s chilling in his own half with Boateng
chilling in his own half with Boateng Dude have you seen our matches lately The only one chilling in our half is Neuer and even that just barely
that vocabulary tho
Is conniption not like a word people use
I mean my friends think I have a huge vocabulary and it s not something I ve ever uttered I meant it as a compliment haha Edit unless you re being sarcastic and I missed it
It s a common enough word in Ireland it means hissy fit
Also common in West Virginia Irish immigrants maybe
Chilling in the centre circle you mean CB have to stay in the other half under Pep or no chocolate
Javi was among the main reasons why we won the CL His presence in midfield was nothing short of staggering It was as if there were three of him Edit Yes please
He has to get back in midfield Simple as that
I love you Javi
Come to Arsenal please
Every thread yada yada
It s cool just throw me a downvote
You can t have all the playmakers and cdms in world gooners
not having any dms is one of the main things that s been fucking them the last few years tbf
He would be a dream signingGeorge Best top 10 goals according to some dude on youtube
in 2 his running dribbling style looks so alike to Messi P S anyone notice Mr Bean s car
The change of pace is amazing Also your flair is amazing
Thank you
Pat Jennings save at the start as well Us Northern Irelander s should have done more with those two surely
Worse teams have won more with worse players See Denmark 92 and Greece 04
Some of the tackles flying in are brutal
Goal number 10 was nuts Half of the players today would still be rolling if that had happened them
So many long balls
Boga jonito
I feel like those first few goals would have been rated much higher had they been in color
Obligatory George Best quotes If you d given me the choice of going out and beating four men and smashing a goal in from thirty yards against Liverpool or going to bed with Miss World it would have been a difficult choice Luckily I had both I spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered I used to go missing a lot Miss Canada Miss United Kingdom Miss World In 1969 I gave up women and alcohol it was the worst 20 minutes of my life On the pizza gate incident between Manchester United and Arsenal That s what children do throw food That s not fighting We were real men We d have chinned them On having blood transfusion after a liver transplant I was in for 10 hours and had 40 pints beating my previous record by 20 minutes I used to dream about taking the ball round the keeper stopping it on the line and then getting on my hands and knees and heading it into the net When I scored against Benfica in the 1968 European Cup final I nearly did it I left the keeper for dead but then I chickened out I might have given the boss a heart attack On Eric Cantona I d give all the Champagne I ve ever drunk to be playing alongside him in a big European match at Old Trafford On Cristiano Ronaldo There have been a few players described as the new George Best over the years but this is the first time it s been a compliment to me And my favourite now They ll forget all the rubbish when I ve gone and they ll remember the football If only one person thinks I m the best player in the world that s good enough for me
And of course George Best was the greatest player in the world Pele
The Pele comparison one anyone remembers In which he would say somewhere along the lines of if he is not that beautiful then he would have achieved more than Pele
This one I think If I had been born ugly you would have never heard of Pel
Yeah look like this But I don t think this is the exact wordings
Is that Ronaldo one true He could only have seen Ronaldo in his first couple of years at United way before he looked like he d become a truly world class player
There are some videos of Ronaldo s first couple of seasons 2014 Ronaldo could be as effective as 2004 Ronaldo with 1 3 of the trickery but you never knew exactly what 2004 Ronaldo would do Edit At least once he d finished his stepovers
I had the once in a lifetime chance to play against George Best and some other UK footballers in 1976 I lived in Torrance California and played youth football since 1966 at the local parks and then in the AYSO I went to High School with Sigi Schmid and Marine Cano ex goalkeeper for TB Rowdies and in 1976 I was at El Camino College in Torrance using the weight room facilities on a Saturday morning in February I was in training for a shot at a berth in the 76 Olympics but in another sport when a friend sees me and knowing I played soccer came into the weight room and told me there was a pick up game on the football practice field and they were looking for more players I was going to decline but then he told me that Rod Stewart was there so off I headed It wasn t just Rod Stewart but also Elton John and and some other expats playing with some other English expats and a good part of the LA Aztec team Pre Season was just around the corner and everybody was trying get the poundage off But I was young and really really fit and was outrunning every body most of the English players I think that year the Aztecs has like a 20 23 man roster and 17 of them were from the UK I hadn t played any organized soccer in 3 years and just kicked around with friends over a year ago but as soon as the rust fell off and I got my feet from under me I started playing better good enough to be asked to come back as a practice player Many NASL teams had unsigned player they had practice with I has to sign some kind of waiver but in turn they paid for a medical insurance policy for me and all training players I played for about 4 5 weekends and a few weekdays before I had to leave for more specialty training in my own sport I remember after I left Terry Fisher the coach of the Aztecs asked about me When I came back from the overseas later that year I was told the Georgie had opened a bar called Besties in Hermosa Beach by the pier on Hermosa Ave When I walked in he was BEHIND the bar LOL but he even remembered me called me a gddam idjet mucker and gave me a pint George was his best customer and he would often take a stack of bar business cards walk down to the beach and pier and hand them out to every good looking bird in a bikini for a free drink and he never cared if they were legal age or not If they were pretty they deserved at least a beer NONE of these girls knew who he was but about 3 out of four a took up the offer and the bar was always filled with birds and also bird watcher who ended up buying a lot of drinks that kept the bar afloat He had an apartment on the beach about a block away George never drove especially in the US but always had someone drive home As drunk as he sometimes got he was usually at every practice on time He really loved football and a hangover was no excuse One of my most prized possessions was an old photo I had taken with me and my girlfriend with Rod Stewart Elton John and George Best I never made the Olympic Team but I did graduate from college and went on to work in Washington DC for an agency that is called now The National Geo Spatial Intelligence Agency and when I moved back to DC I found out my soon to be ex girlfriend had poached that picture along with two T shirts we got from a Battle of the Bands at Redondo Beach Veterans Park of a band we played against called Mammoth as the pimply faced lead guitarist gave to us because he thought my girlfriend was hot Mammoth may not ring a bell but I m sure the name they took later Van Halen would But even though the Tshirts and photos were lost the memories will never be and they sound even better when you talk about your Glory Days But I ll never forget George Best that g ddam idjet mucker for the rest of my days

The saying s much older than youtube
That was the banner that hung in Belfast during his funeral procession
Also it should never be forgotten that it is the tenth anniversary of the death of rallying legend Richard Burns FIFA and RBR it is for tonight
As if anyone needs an excuse for a bit of Richard Burns Rally
I m down
I had no idea You d have thought it would be everywhere here in Belfast with memorial stuff but nah nothing R I P Georgie
Yeah normally they are good at remembering things from the past over here at least we have the Airport
Hahahaha yeah
Well there s a mural of him over on Sandy Row You could call over in your hoops jersey and lay a wreath if you fancied it There was another one out East somewhere but that was painted over to be replaced by a paramilitary one which understandably kicked up a fuss
I well i know about the mural but you think you d have heard something today about it being the 10th anniversary
Im more surprised its only been 10 years Feels so long ago I think they still have a mural up the Cregagh near his childhood house
It s very strange seeing someone reddit referencing the Cregagh
It seems like weeks ago to me
I actually served him drinks in 88 while working at a club opposite Granada Studios He was making the show Best Marsh The Perfect Match and Tony Wilson brought them in for lunch
RIP George
Greatest player to come out of Ireland Most naturally gifted United player You can t teach or learn what Best could do
Isn t it funny how all the most shining eulogies in British football are reserved for players who burnt out early and became complete pissheads Best Le Tiss Gazza etc
I admit Le Tiss had his fair share of McDonalds but i ve never known of any allegation of Alcoholism on his part And maybe a bit bias but he had a pretty average length career retired at 33 due to injury Not exactly the hardest worker but putting him in that category seems a tad harsh
Judging by his Countdown appearances last month Le Tiss is doing fine and is a much smarter guy than anyone would have suspected
He was never an alcoholic but he used to get hammered most Saturday nights during his playing career I live in Southampton and every landlord club owner and taxi driver has got a story about Le Tiss on the piss
Just realized I don t know a term for drinking that rhymes with Le God
Moore Charlton Shearer Beckham BTW Le Tissier played regularly until he was 34
Also not British but from Ireland Paul McGrath can be added to that list Premier League PFA player of the year as a defender I don t think any other defender has managed that
McGrath is actually about as British as it gets He s from Ealing
I ll drink to that
It s funny because he died due to his crippling alcoholism
Yep his problem was so bad that he drank through 2 livers
from what I hear hard to stick to recovery when fans were willing to buy him drinks
In his autobiography the one published before he got his liver transplant Blessed I think it was he said that he tried some hypnotherapy style treatment which he claimed worked for several weeks for him Then when the press found out he was going to it he stopped going because he didn t want people hounding him when he went
Very similar to Paul Gascoigne
Don t die like me Reading Best s story kind of ended up helping me get something of a grip on my own crippling alcoholism Learning of his tragic decline from something mercurial and almost otherwordly to something like a useless tramp bumming around in strange leagues and causing scenes It motherfucking wants you dead or down and out and it doesn t give a shit about how fast smart or successful you are The end phases of death by alcoholism sounds so utterly demeaning disgusting and painful that the actual end sounds like a massive blessing
Fuck man Glad to hear you re doing well
And the tenth anniversary and one day since 24 hour drinking laws passed in the UK
Going on up to the spirit in the sky It s where I m gonna go when I die when I die and they lay me to rest I m gonna go on the piss with Georgie Best
Conversely the man was also an alcoholic wife beating scumbag who took multiple liver transplants that could have went to more deserving people Disgusted this city named our Airport after him too We have many more deserving people in our history Edit Kicking a ball around should not absolve a person from their sins irrespective if you support that club so downvote away Edit 2 United fans down voting as expected
yeah even Utd fans tend to ignore his later days with the club I remember watching a documentary which mentioned that in his last season with Utd he got so fed up with the team s performances that he went AWOL in the middle of the season and decided he d rather party than show up to matches Can you imagine if a famous modern footballer did that
What is Carlos Tevez
Shuck it Trebek
I ll take Football Traitors for 300 Alex
Didn t City ask allow him to take the leave though
for 6 months
Disgusted this city named our Airport after him too We have many more deserving people in our history He was a product of his times and had his demons Fair play he had a dark side but who else was any better The Eamonn Holmes city airport
CS Lewis John Stewart Bell Jocelyn Brunell Gary Moore
Wait so kicking a ball has less merit than playing a guitar
I see you opted not to pick the author or respected scientists Nice
Gary Moore
A man has never defined the Blues more aptly
Agreed I m no fan of the classic blues King Allman Clapton but there was something intense about Moore s style something unique
Equally we shouldnt forget him and denigrate his achievements because he wasnt a very nice man Alcohol addiction isnt something you can control the wife beating is obviously scummy but abusing people for being addicts seems a little harsh I didnt realise an airport was named after him I assume Belfast not Turin
Yeah Belfast
What s it with greatest footballers beating their women Messi will turn alright though i think
It s just stupid people from bad backgrounds who suddenly get the world handed to them on a platter and can t deal with it well
More acceptable back then
Correlates with substance abuse and addiction problems
If Messi started on his wife she could just put him back on his high chair
Even if Messi does get started with the whole domestic violence jag he s probably too small to do much damage no
Kicking a ball around Grow up will you There are few things more cringey than someone saying football is kicking a ball around as if it s that simple You re no better than these people on Facebook demanding that footballers swap their wages with soldiers As for Best s alcoholism and liver transplants that was his personal life This post is celebrating the footballer
You re no better than these people on Facebook demanding that footballers swap their wages with soldiers I love these its brilliant to see people trying to work out the economics of it and realising how fucking stupid it is
One brings joy and entertainment to the masses The other invades foreign nations on the whim of politicians FWIW I m not having a go at soldiers We all need to make a living but we can all stretch the logic to suit our arguments
It s fucking bullshit Its like my mother or my wife when united lose a big match It s just a game For better or worse people invest a huge part of themselves to this game Look at the faces of the fans when their team scores a an important goal What else brings that much extreme mixture of positive emotions fleeting as it might be Very fucking little
It s just a game must be the stupidest quote ever To them it may just be a game but the fans it means everything people often say men show no emotion but you look in the crowd after a team has been relegated won a cup and you ll see many emotions including grown men in tears
It s the same with any Maradona post But he beat his wife but but he s a cocaine addict but he he cheated by using drugs
With a friend currently on the transplant list who has barely drank a pint in his life fuck this guy not only do people like him take organs that other people deserve more high profile cases like his actually discourages people from signing up to be a donor
high profile cases like his actually discourages people from signing up to be a donor Is that true I just can t imagine people refusing to be donors because of cases of famous people being privileged
I d be amazed if this is the case
Not what I meant in the slightest an alcoholic who is famous meaning people who might have previously signed up to be an organ donor wouldn t do so one of the main reasons people use to not sign up is because they feel that there organs would go to alcoholics and drug addicts
Some might say alcoholics and drug addicts are victims of horrible crippling illnesses too
Seen children who had no choice in the slightest become ill and rely on donations to live hard to feel sympathy for somebody who bragged about the champagne lifestyle he had and caused other people to be discouraged from signing up to be donors because they don t want there organs going to alcoholics and drug addicts For what it s worth I think there is a vast difference between someone who homeless or has suffered abuse and has turned to substance than a rich and famous footballer
So a rich and famous footballer deserves no sympathy for being blighted by a horrible condition I m not one to pick and choose who I feel bad for The man died from this He s not sitting in some mansion somewhere lording it over his stockpile of livers And I agree he s no more deserving of a liver than someone else Perhaps less so because his illness wasn t just something that could be fixed with a new liver But if you were dying and were offered a liver would you really turn it down for someone more deserving You re a bigger man than me if you would
Hang on are you saying he should have turned it down Blame the system dont blame the guy for taking something available to him that could save his life
He got himself into that situation by drinking to excess and bragging about it whenever he could
I can t believe people are circlejerking his LOL I DRANK ALL DAH ALCHAHOL quotes from him after he had one of his fifty six liver transplants It s fucking pathetic Sure he s a good footballer but he sounds like he was an absolute tosspot
Whats worse was the actual real life circle jerk People in Belfast knew he was an alcoholic it was literally killing him yet they where busting their asses to buy the man a pint just so they could say they drunk with their hero Pathetic
Pretty much exactly the same happened with Alex Higgins Probably Gazza too
You can t fault them They re Irish
Yeah if he was Australian we d probably just take a photo with him outside the local prison
That was nice
They d probably classify themselves as either Irish or more than likely Northern Irish
The man was a first class prick I m glad his hedonistic lifestyle ended as it did but the repercussions can be felt on his family
ITT folk who ve been lucky enough never to have had to deal with addiction in their lives Talk is cheap lads
I think it s where you see the average age of the subreddit coming out Haven t had to deal with their own shit or haven t lost anybody to anything like alcoholism or drug addiction Ill people aren t arseholes they re ill
Bunch of absolute cunts Seemingly think that alcoholism is just loving the drink no self control Best was just a party animal Its being dependent on alcohol every second of every day And if one more person equates him going through two livers to stopping two people having transplants I ll swing for them The first liver was his fucking own he wasnt giving that away
I ll swing for them https pbs twimg com media CHFE EvWwAA2rpH jpg
Yeah addiction is a problem and it s hard to stop doing something you re addicted to But when you burn through 2 livers because you can t stop you re taking chances away from other people People who might ve lived a longer and more decent life Talk is cheap mate Just because he was good on the pitch doesn t mean he should be worshipped off it
One of the livers was his own tbf What is your solution Let him die Its not like it was a conscious decision to kill himself after the transplant he was an addict
I don t know if I have a solution But he shouldn t have been bragging about slugging pints while on medicine
If I had to choose between dribbling past 5 players and scoring from 40 yards at Anfield or shagging Miss World it d be a hard choice Thankfully I ve done both George Best
Proper legend
Dumb cunt didn t deserve liver transplants he got Because of him many people who actually deserved 2nd chances didn t get them
Helmet
He s right though
Alcohol addiction doesn t make him a dumb cunt though
Alcoholism is the only disease you can get yelled at for having
Just an Asshole
He s a prick for other reasons but being unable to control his alcoholism isn t one of them
Its like they think that people make conscious decisions to become addicts
Yeah don t think Besty really thought oh I ve just gone through a whole load of pain and been bedridden for months while slowly bringing myself closer and closer to death but I might just do it all over again just for a laugh Could be another one of those stories people tell about my banter
Not for alcoholism For the multiple liver transplant which could be used by other non scum people
And the liver transplants were brought on by his inability to control his addiction Not sure what point you re making
The point is that people who consistently relapse into alcohol abuse shouldn t receive transplants over other patients and should be pushed down lower in the waiting lists
No shit Poirot My point is that doesn t make Best an asshole He didn t relapse on purpose
To be even considered for a liver transplant a patient has to be fully responsible to keep it healthy It is pretty much like 2nd chance When they screen for possible candidates that is an extremely important category without it people don t get livers He got them because of his status and pissed it away An addict got a healthy liver over someone who actually was sick
Hmm I m starting to think he might have had some kind of addiction to the alcohol Almost as if he had no control of his drinking We should probably tell the authorites For now let s just call it alcoholism until they come up with a better name for it
He got them because of his status and pissed it away And died People are acting like Best got away with one His addictions killed him We should be pitiying him not abusing him Its these attitudes and misunderstandings of addiction that mean we dont treat them properly
So if he got the liver because of who he was and not because he was considered responsible enough to be sensible with alcohol post transplant why does that make him an asshole Surely it d be the people who made the decision My point doesn t change if that s the argument
If you re drinking is so bad that you need many livers it s probably time to go Also being in addiction doesn t desolve you from criticism There s nothing wrong with drinking and driving then it s just addiction
Haha what an incredible leap
Well 2 people didn t get second chances not sure how he d have stopped many people lol

Yeah it s a good compilation I reckon I even like the music I remembered this clip after searching for some clips of him a while back to see how great he was and this clip thoroughly convinced me
10 years already I remember watching his funeral on the TV Shame he practically retired at 25 due to drinking and partying
If only he had a tiny bit of professionalism he could have gone on to be a Man Utd legend like Wayne Rooney
The famously professional Wayne Rooney Would you say the same about Tony Adams
If Tony Adams had missed training to go and get pissed or if he retired because he didn t get his own way and threw a hissy fit about leaving the club then yes Just so happens he didn t do any of that but that arrogant cunt Best did
Must have missed a fair bit of training when he was in jail for two months having been convicted of drunk driving Alcoholism is a disease why does Adams get a pass where Best does not
Because Adams as a former Arsenal player is infallible apparently
Adams as a former Arsenal player didn t ruin two livers through being a pisshead cunt and didn t run away from training numerous times to aid that It s a case of someone who turned their life around and one nasty bastard who refused to
He did however drive drunk and admitted to playing games for Arsenal while pissed So he was a danger to others and put his career at risk Its a case of someone who turned their life around and someone who couldnt Do you think all addicts are just selfish
George Best drunk himself through multiple livers and into his deathbed Tony Adams beat his addiction and set up the sporting chance clinic to help fellow athletes beat their addictions
Continuing to drink after his liver transplant was stupid but it cost him his life Do you think he was doing it for a laugh because he just loved a party Alcoholism is a disease Adams should be lauded for beating it but Best shouldnt be abused for succumbing To criticise Best for allowing his alcoholism to affect his career and not Adams who missed months of a season and even played drunk is hypocritical
Stay classy buddy
Stay classy buddy How is he not being classy What the fuck does classy even mean in this sense You spoke ill of a footballer I like ergo you are not classy Typical vote pandering neckbeard babble
Maybe criticising someone in a thread about the anniversary of their death isn t a terribly nice thing to do
It s 100 serious I don t understand why Man Utd fans fall over themselves to laud Best who never wanted to play for them and missed training all the time to go get pissed yet slander a club legend like Rooney if he goes a couple of games without scoring
who never wanted to play for them You re speaking out of your arse Also no one s slandering Rooney He s their second highest goal scorer From what I can tell they merely want him benched
He has a point though Play to your best your entire career win countless accolades retire late on like Rooney and Lampard and you will be hated mercilessly mocked and ridiculed Burn out retire early and drink yourself half to death and the nation will love you for it We have a weird self loathing complex in English football where we hate the successful but eulogise the people who wasted their careers and talent
Yeah Lineker Shilton Shearer Beckham Scholes Neville etc are all hated Lets not pretend Rooney doesnt get a lot of warranted stick He s unprofessional he spends his summers drinking and smoking and he s twice threatened to walk out on United in order to get himself a bigger pay packet He s also not performed for England at a tournament in 10 years including letting us down badly in 2006 He s clearly been a fantastic player but that doesnt mean we have to love him

Some fake ass bromance IMO
I d go as far as say that even Arbeloa would be a better replacement for Carvajal if the latter can t play for some reason than Danilo Porto are laughing their asses of for robbing Madrid 30M

Much credit to Bale for Cristiano s goal
Guys how s Kovacic been so far in this game
Kovacic himself said he s much better as a DM than as a offensiv midfielder higher up on the field Don t really think he ll be a success in the game

Bayern or Barcelona the one with the less injuries
His teams does not play spectacular football but the results are decent He has never been fired or relegated and made pretty good things with small teams Bastia Saint Etienne in Ligue 2 Nice

They sold their best players while offering new expansive contracts to average players and they built a new expansive stadium who is not profitable
Pique would have done the calma calma then the siiiiiiii celebration and then he would have spent the last minutes with his right hand opened to show the manita
CamaradonaEverything is back to normal in r soccer now
Setanta commentator they ve been well almost perfect while Messi s been away And now they re em they re just perfect
Still no Pogba screamers
Not enough degaard updates either
And Diego Costa antics shaming
He just got someone sent off I don t think it will be long
Well there it is
Chelsea are winning games now though
It s truly miraculous how game in this situation is plural
Tis a Christmas miracle
Was Messi actually injured Jesus
Took time off to gather more Ki
Yeah he ran out of sensu beans earlier
He gave them to Suarez and Neymar actually He didn t need them
He s been doing intense meditation sessions with the Elder Kai and is now Mystic Messi
Spent a couple of episodes charging up his spirit bomb
Just took time off to become Super Messi God Super Messi
more Ki Seung yueng
He s going to for a Spirit bomb isn t he
Those three are just insane Mezmerizing
Messimerizing
Yeah something like that D
Messimaruazing
Messuaneymarising
That s actually one of the best team goals I ve ever seen
How do you even defend that Three players just absolutely tearing through the whole team
foul
lucas would have brought somebody down
Except he would have already been on a yellow and would have had to let him go
Classic
two fouls
People can t just go flying through the air like that Jackie
You don t That s when you shake your head and say Too good
You just can t They re doing this against Roma but they could do it to any side
They can only do it when the opposing team doesn t defend properly If they do track the runners you can stop moves like that Problem is they do it to you all game and eventually you have a lapse in concentration and they do this to you
Just takes one player s lapse in concentration for that breakdown The fact that Barca does this so frequently is what s scary
was thinking that I suppose the backline has to push up with impeccable timing but with passing that quick it s not gonna happen In fairness to Roma they look like they were trying not to sit too deep but that frontline is just too good
Foul hard enough to sit someone down on the build up
At the start of the clip Keita is man marking him After Messi lays the ball of he follows it when he didn t need to If he stays with him he can block his run Even after Keita lost him it was still stoppable When Messi lays the ball of the second time Maicon doesn t react to his run If he reacted earlier he would have easily dealt with the ball It s great play by Barca and they caused the mistakes but the goal was avoidable from Roma s perspective
If Keita had stayed with Messi then Neymar would ve passed to Suarez instead From there Suarez would have the ball with plenty of space Neymar and Messi to look up to and maybe even made a similar sort of run himself there s just endless possibilities so score when you ve got a team playing as good as Barca have been playing
track the runners instead of chasing the ball The RCB has didn t track the run of messi leading to the goal
The RB and CB tried he was just too quick for them
Football porn
It s reminiscent of Arsenal s goal vs Norwich Aka this one https www youtube com watch v wz EaTwqNII
Why the fuck did someone feel the need to play Coldplay over this
Apparently either Norwich or Arsenal used to rule the world
Just not as good as Arsenal s I might be biased
Biased but correct tbqh
staight from the most biased source of them all thanks
Nah that Norwich goal was beautiful
No definitely not as good but similar for sure
God I love soccer
That was better than porn imo
You can t just pay a young lady with big tits to deliver goals like this in the champions league
That s what you think
Maybe we should try
We do have the technology now
Like something straight out of a video game
I wish I could do that in Fifa
And that finish Pure art
Seriously how the fuck do you stop that Unreal
chop him down
MSN is finally back
You know what s unfair this is not even surprising anymore Those three are an exhibition
Seriously Watched this goal and was like oh wow that was nice but was upset that the ball was played over the top to Messi instead of a backheel I just want the buildup to go on forever because I know once he s through its over
Good guy Alves
Didn t pull a Nani
That still irritates me
Some say it still keeps Ronaldo up at night
That explains why he keeps moving further and further away from Ronaldo
That will always irritate me Nani ruined what would have been the greatest goal of Ronaldo s life Ronaldo beats both the greatest defender in the world at the time Pique then the greatest keeper of all time Casillas against who was the greatest team in the world at the time Spain All those things together and Nani invalidates the goal with his greed Infuriating To this day I think it was the greatest piece of football I ve ever seen of course enhanced by the fact that he beat both Pique and Casilllas I don t care how impressive a clip is if it s in the Ukranian league EDIT To everybody telling me Nani was onside I don t know if it was true I still see a lot of debate till today Ronaldo still argues that Nani was onside Here is the best screenshot I could get from a low fps clip you be the decider https gyazo com 6c13739c5292aab0594f73b8c685092f Ronaldo always seemed to be a good sport about it but onside or offside that ball was going over the line and I don t see why Nani couldn t shy away like Alves did to give his teammate his deserved goal
But it was a friendly Ronaldo should have done that in the weeks before when he was playing spain in the world cup
Does anybody have a clip of this
https youtu be j5gDJfFvObg
idk soccer what happened
The ball would have gone in the net and been a goal for Ronaldo but because Nani headed the ball in while being offsides there was no goal Edit got called offsides
We followed the guy Ronaldo completly outplay the defense of the opposing team and scoring a goal or so he thought At the last moment one of his teammates hits the ball but he s so far up he s off side thus cancelling the goal Ronaldo gets mad rightfully so i d say
Here you go
Nani was onside though no 3 I think Pique plays him on with his legs because he s lying down and even so Nani touched it after it passed the line
STUPID NANI CANCEL CRISTIANO RONALDO AMAZING GOAL NEW 2015
GONE SEXUAL
he was behind messi when he shot he ball he actually impeded the defenders clearance by being in front of him Woulda been called offside had he actually been offside
He is in ultra teamplayer mode today
Isn t he always
He is he rather passes the ball than score himself
Great restraint and he held off that last defender
Hahah it s just really bad defending right guys They can t really be that good Right Guys sobs
I instantly turned into arab football commentator what a beauty
Why arab Are they the same as those south americans that yell goooal for like a minute
Replace GOL with YA ALLLLAAAAAAAAH
Yababa ya baba
They don t stop talking for a second literally
No joke These guys talk incessantly for 90 minutes Every single action on the pitch is commentated
https youtu be XTpGw 7Y0as They sound hilarious
love the rhyming Arabic and French are becoming my favorite commentary languages
Actually the guy goes full poetry It s an Arabic thing
They re my favourite because they don t copyright their stuff so we can use it
They say golaso in Arabic
Golaso is universal

See if Barcelona scored a goal like this it would be at the top of r soccer
I ain t even mad
My god this is one of the more fine goals I ve ever seen
If i dont see peak bayern and peak barcelona play each other this year i will be slightly angry
The passing the movement the Messi Perfection on a football pitch
Some fine Messi ing by Barcelona so far tonight
This is some performance Suicidally naive high press by Roma but Barcelona s passing and pressure is just beautiful Nigh unplayable
We ve made Messi a verb Pack it up boys
passing and movement are nouns as is Messi
As is life

Never thought i would see this many Roma posts on the r Soccer front page
Neymar Messi Neymar Messi Su rez lob Messi lob GOOOOOOOAL

That was the Mona Lisa of goals I could sit and watch it all day
5 0 now this is one of the best players to ever play together
What the fuck is this shit How the fuck do you beat this shit What the fuck
Alves being a bro
DAMN 5 0 now this is absolutely the best Barcelona squad
MSN is back
aside from the possible risk of epilepsy good gif
You re looking for the word seizure Epilepsy is a disorder that usually includes symptoms like seizures
Thanks that is the word
Oh my
I regret nothing
He s Back
Let s face it at this moment Barca is just at a totally different level The set up of that goal is crazy and the finish Well its a Messi finish what else can be said
The assist for the goal was totally flithy I think that was from Suarez Such a deft touch
What a goal These guys are playing at an insane level nowadays
Holy shit
tiki taka level MSN
reminds me of Austrias team goal vs Liechtenstein this year http gfycat com GoodnaturedDistinctItalianbrownbear

Two things that turn worse on videogames Curry and MSN

If any Prem team scored a goal like that it would be goal of the season That seems to be a standard Barca goal All their goals are just amazing

BAAA
Incredible goal my god
That was insanely good
Oh my what the fuck MSN That was honestly magical
Falque thought about appealing for offside for a second before deciding fuck it
Shit is not even fair jesus
Suarez can do anything
You know at this point you should really just foul them Maicon grab his shirt and pull him the fuck down So you ll get a yellow big deal But I guess it doesn t matter in the end because they gonna score some more anyway
He s baaaack
I love how people used to worry about how selfish Suarez and Neymar would play with Messi on the same pitch Jumped off my couch for this one

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsIs a player considered a one club man if he was loaned out early in his career
If Andros Townsend spends the rest of his career at tottenham it would be funny if he gets considered as a one club man after like 10 loans
No need to exaggerate only 9 loans
Yes Lahm was loaned to Stuttgart back in his early days if I recall correctly and he s still considered a one club man i m sure there are other examples it s just that I can t think of anyone else from the top of my head
John Terry also was loaned out but noone would really argue he isn t a one club man eitherGood man Had a season ticket at Cracovia when I studied out there Some season we re having Great to see Kapustka doing so well too
Lived in Hyde Park Burley Roundhay and Swarcliffe Never had a problem in any of them
Can the dog die May sound weird but me purchasing the game is highly dependant on this I don t want to let him down
Leeds have more points than that
There s a club on Elland Road just off Lowfields Road who could do with some new players at the moment Owner is a bit of a knob mind Could probably get a game
Just a normal Leeds fan he was active on a Leeds message board once upon a time Tackle was clean and just done for a laugh that s how Vinnie was
Bremner or even his Leeds team mate Norman Bites yer legs Hunter Aggressive players who sure could play

Cheers bro
Is the 50 to 80 in dollars
Can someone tell me exactly what these things are I need to accept I can t grow a beard I m also guessing you wouldn t recommend buying a cheap razor from eBay
Don t give a fuck about off the line clearances ten men etc It s an away win And with how we ve been playing I ll take it
Silvestri terrible for the goal which is a shame as his handling looked markedly better today Berardi positive on the ball but some mistakes such as passing Bamba erratic Cooper meh Taylor handled his winger well and got in behind once Dallas meh Adeyemi woeful Murphy positive on the ball dwelled a bit at times though Cook far too good for this team Wood did he win a header Antenucci hard worker always looks like he ll make something happen We need something different hopefully Botaka is it
I m just not sure why it takes us so bloody long to get going Dallas is great but only in the second half I d start Antenucci on the right over Byram He might say he doesn t want to but I don t think a player should dictate his terms to the manager He s a right footed player who is clearly comfortable cutting inside and shifting it onto his left He can definitely do a job there I d also like to see Murphy start over Mowatt
No worries I can see Inter having a good season Strengthened well and Juve s poor start will be a great motivator

Holy shit that may be the highest rated squad I ve ever seen You have a 91 rated Thiago on the bench ffs Nice job The presentation looks very nice too
Yes this is the area final Should have clarified that This is Fratton Park home stadium of Portsmouth
I won after penalties Every penalty went in until I finally saved their 8th shot And sorry for this stupid small screen GIF My first time recording my screen on PC and I didn t put FIFA in fullscreen because I didn t think it would like this if I didn t Ninja EDIT I m Portsmouth btw and was playing against Crawley Town against Legendary
No you could hear three explosions in the first half very loud in the stadium and broadcastExcept we can t beat Spurs Like ever
Neither can Swansea
yeah well
Zac would be a Swansea fan
because he s pretty but struggling of late
Same back at you With love not really Man Utd
I got your back bro
This year only one team has beaten Spurs Even United needed an OG to do it
Yep Here s a list of scorers of winning goals against Spurs in the prem this season Kyle Walker
Always rated him
Wenger did in fact almost sign him
United didn t beat Spurs Kyle Walker did
If Walker had not scored Rooney would have
Rooney looked like he had a bad case of buck fever in that instance Much like Kane did last Sunday
It s less fun when you think of it that way
To be fair the only reason Walker ended up scoring is because Rooney bottled it
Man of the match he was I was hoping he would hit top form that game too haha
And everyone can beat Villa
Almost everyone
sadly
I mean we ve beaten everyone else since our return Both us and Tottenham have had a mix of managers And yet no matter what we seem to do we just can t beat them I m not hopeful the December match this year either
We ll probably go 2 0 up but end as a draw
Maybe though you re apparently more confident in our team s ability to go 2 up against any team right now
I always get super nervous against Southampton since you guys are usually tearing it up at the time but for whatever reason we seem to pull the win or tie out of no where at times Usually great games though well at least in my biased opinion haha
I think two or three times in the last couple of season we ve been 2 0 up against you guys at half time then Christian Eriksen just decides to tear us apart in the second half and you guys win 3 2
Or that one season of Adebeyor going nuts in his first game back under Sherwood Basically his only bit of form in years and it gets him two goals against us
It was nice feeling the way Spurs might have felt when Elia went nuts and scored two away against Newcastle last season
Yeah fuck Newcastle and that Krul game
Yeah just go God mode for one game and all is well We d been on a good run against Newcastle at that point too
I think we seem to beat you and Swansea a lot as your good footballing sides like we are but also not quite as good as us So you don t sit deep you actually have a go at us That weird thing where you tend to struggle more against as worse side who are just happy to take a draw It s like how united used to just always beat us
This season it is definitely you doing the tearing up
tie Spotted the American
spoiler alert there s more than one
Wait non English people watch footy as well
Haha true I hadn t even noticed I actually usually do say draw interestingly enough

And we can t beat fucking Norwich such is life
Newcastle Norwich was 6 2 sorry to be that guy
FUCK
Sorry Love your work though
I preferred his earlier stuff it s too commercial now
Did you actually make this Saw it earlier on today on another site
These things get made around this time every year Someone else could ve made one as well
Well at least I didn t have to be that guy
That game broke my heart
That game partially mended mine only for it to be repeatedly shattered afterwards
Business as usual as a Newcastle supporter then
Should say where anybody can beat Chelsea
except Arsenal
And us
In fairness we can t beat anyone
Bournemouth
Oh do fuck off
Fuck injuries
After 13 games I m starting to think the only word to describe us is that we re Fucked
Chin up Tamworth is only 9 points from the top
You think you re special We lose every week
Looking forward to this weekend but will be sitting in the home end as the away end sold out
Actually says Where nobody can beat Leicester Except Arsenal
Not saying we would ve won but to be fair Mike Dean fucked us over e Lol no idea why I m in the negative now Hell I don t get r soccer sometimes the officiating that match was dreadful and even Chelsea fans can admit that
You guys always say that
Every team s fanbase blames the refs on a regular basis hardly an Arsenal exclusive phenomenon Did you even watch that match It was a very unusual case
I was joking I forgot how sensitive it gets in here sometimes I remember Mike Dean fucking over many teams to be fair I didn t catch that specific match but did see the outrage afterwards My cousin supports arsenal and after every loss he blames the ref no matter what It s quite funny
Your cousin must have hated you for joining Manchester United
Nah its all good he got him an Xbox
Yeah well
Never expected to see Dan s thumbs on r soccer
Is this from Ninja Sex Party
This ninja
No this one NSFW
Isn t Juventus having a pretty poor start to their campaign as well
They started out absolutely abysmally Chelsea esque but have recently been kicking things up and are in the 6 spot after beating Milan last Saturday
Leicester have still only lost once and they went into the lead in that game mad
The best team they didn t lose to was Tottenham and they drew them The best team they ve beaten is West Ham 2 1 The next month will be telling for this team
Pretty good considering our defence let in 14 goals in the first 7 games Thank god for the rest of the team making us score
Like Liverpool 2013 14
But Leicester Could win the league
In fairness them being in the league doesn t add much as they where behind in a load of games Spurs have also only lost once
What about when not being fair
For La Liga 12 games played Sporting beat Malaga beat Deportivo beat Rayo beat Palmas beat Sociedad beat Sevilla beat Getafe beat Levante beat Villarreal beat Atletico beat Eibar beat Granada beat Bilbao beat Valencia beat Celta beat Barca beat Real beat Espanyol beat Betis beat Sporting There is nothing special about this specific cycle there are 3657 such cycles for La Liga Havent written code for EPL You can find the code here http pastebin com QdRvfwRv You will need to modify the arrays if you want it to work for the different leagues EDIT Coded it for EPL There are 144 such chains for EPL A different example for EPL Bournemouth beat West Ham beat Newcastle beat Norwich beat Swansea beat United beat Tottenham beat Sunderland beat Crystal Palace beat Liverpool beat City beat Everton beat West Brom beat Arsenal beat Leicester beat Watford beat Stoke beat Southampton beat Chelsea beat Aston Villa beat Bournemouth
without a circly picture I won t believe you
The circlier the truthier
Which is to say if anyone can beat anyone La Liga is more competitive
Yeah this means nothing Example circles for La Liga Serie A
Without pictured badges and fancy slogan I won t believe you
Damnit man I m a software engineer not a graphic designer
Not with that attitude
And now do Bundesli oh well Bayern
The Internet being the Internet
Graphviz
graphviz is where it s at
Damn right it is I don t usually get to see my computer science and football worlds intersect so neatly
La Liga Where anybody can beat anybody
And in all 144 Leicester will be next to Arsenal and Spurs will be next to ManU
The irony that this is more true for La Liga when this infographic was meant to defend the EPL s recent poor form in Europe is pretty funny
For what it s worth here s the version with the corrected scores http imgur com JzpajZe Edit Correcterer scores
Did you use an algorithm to find this path or was your work manual Edit I was bored so I spent a little bit of time writing a Java app to brute force it Here s all the combinations of which 144 exist at the moment They all start on Stoke but being circular you d get the same results ultimately no matter where you started Edit 2 OP s combination is on line 43 Edit 3 Tried to do the same for Bundesliga And well Can t because Bayern
Shouldn t be too hard to do manually it s quite closely defined by the fact that Villa and Bournemouth have only won one game each and Tottenham and Leicester have only lost one After that there aren t too many decisions to make

the answer we were looking for was badge or crest
We all know what he meant but it s badge
Is it still a badge if there is no shield
Get ready for the Sport bible to steal this without credit
I remember this was the case during the 13 14 season as well and it turned into a very good season entertainment wise so hopefully it s the same here
It feels like this one has already started to top 13 14
It s shaping up quite similar 4 5 teams at the top of the table with only a couple of points separating them the champions faltering badly and a team at the bottom who everyone has nailed down as relegated but a new manager could bring some hope
Hope What s this magical hope you re talking of
He was talking about Chelsea
I don t know I m being nice to Villa it must be this damn Christmas spirit of mine
I hope some of our opposition have some Christmas spirit and gift us three points soon I m looking at you Watford
I hope Scrooge takes away your points for Christmas
You need a heart transplant for being nice to the Seals and a brain transplant for thinking they have a hope
Yeah but I don t think Chelsea will fire Mourinho
Obviously I m a biased Liverpool fan but 13 14 was ridiculous Suarez had one of the best years that I ve ever seen from any footballer Yaya Toure was at his peak devastating bullying best Mourinho blew his chances of winning the league in his first year back at Chelsea with conservative tactics Tactics Tim had that beautiful gilet and weird salute thing with Adebayor Fulham hired a crazy guy and Moyes ruined Man U Crazy season This season is good so far though even if Liverpool have been mostly bad
We got Klopp that s the best part of this season
13 14 a good season depends on the perspective I guess
We only lost 2 0 to City not 3
Oh man seems I have a real problem reading and copying Apologies
It feels good that we only fit in this because of a very unfortunate own goal
we only lost 3 1 to Southampton
Ugh I had the results written out right in front of me as I made it and I still ballsed it up Apologies
Literally a cicrlejerk
This graphic for new r soccer logo
BPL is the most entertaining league Great density at the top great international players and teams with lots of tradition still being at the top Downsides are the atmosphere in the stadium and the lack of homegrown talent EDIT for some reason I like Stoke
In reference to your latter point lack of homegrown talent that s one of the reasons it s been so exciting to follow Spurs lately It s a shame that it does seem so rare but hopefully with investment in academies we ll see such things become more common
convert him Convert Him CONVERT HIM RUMMENIGGER THE SPURS SUPPORTER

I ll fight you for him

EDIT for some reason I like Stoke Top lad Most of the atmospheres are decent really its the top teams with their day trippers who struggle
EDIT for some reason I like Stoke All the right reasons
For some reason continentals think when we say it s the best league it means the highest quality teams when it s only because it s the most exciting even if the quality isn t as high
It might still be if you account for the entire table
Atmospheres at the big clubs maybe
Just wait till next year and your move into a bowl stadium
That s when we become a big club you heard it here first domalino
Atmosphere at West Ham has been slowly dying for years Doubt there will ever be a game like the Ipswich play offs again which is kind of sad
I was at the home leg of the Ipswich game and I have a season ticket this year and I disagree Think that s an odd game to pick because there have been better games since beating Chelsea a few weeks ago was about as good as any game I ve been to Even Everton in the cup last year with less than 30 000 fans there Every Tottenham game
Ya the top teams have superstars are fun to watch and are prone to playing like shit every third or 4th week so the other sides aren t completely out of it
Stoke
wouldn t you be able to do this in any league with no undefeated teams
Not necessarily no If you have teams that have only beaten the same teams for example it gets tricky Also only 13 games in to a season is quite early however in that crazy 13 14 season it only took 10 games
Oh ok thanks for clarifying that up
No worries Also it was made trickier by the fact Leicester have only lost one Tottenham have only lost one and Aston Villa have only won one so their positions were fixed in the circle next to Arsenal Man U and Bournemouth respectively
Not necessarily because it s possible a league has two teams who have only lost once each but both to the same team You wouldn t be able to do a circle if that were the case
Where everybody is kinda not really good and everyone will watch the UCL semis from their comfy couch
The whole anybody can beat anybody thing is true of every league in the world and I still don t understand why people only ever say it about the Premier League like they re unique or something Even in supposed one two horse race leagues like La Liga the juggernaut teams almost always lose a couple of games a season to teams they shouldn t be losing to
Because big teams lose to small teams very often that hardly happens in la liga and especially the bundesliga Although it does happen from time to time it s just a lot more uncommon Plus imagine barca bayern or madrid in the position chelsea is in right now Quite literally impossible But not saying the competitiveness of the league is the sole reason for the bad form but it does contribute
Plus imagine barca bayern or madrid in the position chelsea is in right now Quite literally impossible on the other hand could you imagine Chelsea or city or united sinking into mediocrity like AC Milan did in serie A
You mean like we did 5 6 years ago Doesn t happen often I grant you but it still happens
Something like Chelsea is literally happening for the first time in the Prem it s a bit silly to infer anything from it It s exceptional Well except for Dortmund last season I guess
How fast are people forgetting United under Moyes
Moyes United wasn t nearly as bad as Chelsea were in their first 12 or so games this season
No but other aspects of their respective declines are similar
That s because the big teams in Bayern Madrid and Barca are better and more consistent than the teams fighting for the title in the EPL
True u Al Gala needs to give us an infographic of upset frequency to really measure the stratification of the top leagues
Marketing
I feel like The Circle of Life should be playing in the background There s even a lion with a crown on its head
I got you https youtu be VxTQKxyJyxw
Fuckin hell norwich scored 2 goals against newcastle amazing up front Just the back was the problem
I remember that one time Villa won a match What a day
Any particular reason why you made the scores on the bottom half as if they were away wins I am not moaning about it just found it very confusing
I tried to make it so the team s score was closest to their logo I m graphically challenged though and didn t know how best to put it on the thing
Here is the one from 13 14 season http i imgur com oGtMJF2 jpg I personally find that way easier I could not imagine any kind of layout with scorelines in there either tough task
Yeah I did that one too tried to step it up with scores this time haha
Ah I was wondering since you mentioned that in your other comment here Really challenging design with the scorelines I will see if I can come up with something as well
I actually hadn t seen it as Elinaeri did although of course that is the standard football naming convention Scores closest to the logo made sense to me
Maybe as a cyclical human centipede
Can someone make one of these for the 03 04 season
Look at how much we suck look at our top teams failing week in week out That must mean the league is more competitive s
Football Feed on facebook have nicked your post
Well technically it s after 106 games played
I m glad we could do our part with our one win against Bournemouth
I ll believe that when we beat Palace
A Condorcet circle The cool thing about Condorcet circles is that you can delete all of the results from all of the matches involved in the circle and get the same rankings The thing is though that this is probably not the only Condorcet circle in the EPL this season
I am not sure but I don t think this holds true if the teams are separated by goal difference
Right only zero sum results Disregard the scores
https twitter com SoccerAM status 669613679013400576 Looks like SoccerAM have reposted this without giving credit
Where anybody can beat anybody Except Villa Villa can only beat Bournemouth
this is really cool
Awfully kind of Villa to only win one game this year to give our content creators somewhere to start
Giggled at Liverpool beating Stoke 1 0 thinking about last year and all
Do this for the 2003 04 season
urgh probably the only team to lose to sunderland Most depressing night this season
I will see if I can come up with scores this time haha AhC
Ah ok that went over my head P
I think he does often play as a right back he s right footed
Let s talk about facts
Credit to our lord and savior Omar
Bbbbbbbbbbbbbale
Marcelo Azevedo
where did Koscielny play before I thought he had been a centre back since the beginning of his career at Guingamp Tours Lorient
idk lol it all happened so fast
wow does anyone have a gif of Ward s skill to get around kaboul just now i think it was an elastico or nutmeg too quick to tell
after triumphantly turning into Diamond Palace last match v Liverpool I fully expect Palace to play like Tin Palace and go 0 2 down against Sunderland today within 20 minutes
Maybe Sarfaraz Ahmed 48 off 46 and Misbah 68 off 72 to win that match against SL in dying light in Jan 2014 Also definitely Sehwag 83 off 68 v England he turned a draw into a win Finally Sarwan and Chanderpaul chatting 418 v Aus in 2003
Apparently pontus wernbloom and Cheick Tiot
Is there not a rule in place that prevents loanees from playing against their parent club
Ah ok
That pass to Arnautovic was class don t know who did it tho
City 3 0 Liverpool
alt f4 is a shortcut on pc to immediately close all active Windows
Are Maxim and Pantilimon unfit
yeah I think it s Buffon Barzagli Chiellini Bonucci Darmian Florenzi Soriano Marchisio El Shaarawy Eder Pell
nice thanks for the threadDamn number 66 is not looking good today
That s Marcio Azevedo i really don t know why he s at Shakhtar or how he s been doing but he was average to shit in Brazil
But he always had 5 Star skills on FIFA
he has 4 get your shit together
He had 5 in FIFA 12
i am aware always had not sound weird to anyone else tho plus he wasn t even on fut 14 and 15
Fifa 12 13 legend
Probably has a very good agent
Most big teams get the world class brazillian talent Shakhtar ends up mostly with average ones Jadson Douglas Costa and William are probably exceptions
Not really most of their offensive buys were once a great prospect here Bernard did extremely well in Brazil and won Libertadores with Atletico Fred was bought early in his Internacional career but he was already highly rated Taison was great at Internacional where he also won the Libertadores Wellington Nem who hasn t been playing also did quite well at Fluminense and was considered a young prospect in Brazil Alex Teixeira was as highy rated as Coutinho in the beginning of their career at Vasco Then you have Fernandinho Douglas Costa Jadson Willian The average players they get are defenders like Marcio Azevedo and Ismaily
I am actually brazillian too but now living in Spain I know the trajetory of most of the players you mentioned and we have to be honest there is a reason a lot of talented players dont suceed or arent as great as they look the brazillian league isnt on a high level for something about 10 12 years most of the talent ends up being not even close to world class when they come to Europe
me and every other brazilian fan might agree that the league isn t nowhere near as it once was but still those players were good young prospects once if they turn out to be world class or not that s another thing
Marcelo Azevedo

That was the most hardman nutmeg and lob combination i ve ever seen Awesome
Dani is a warrior It s criminal that Danilo has started over him
He looks like he spends his spare time lumberjacking
What a goal from a right back with his weak foot
dani and luka scoring in the same match i m not crying you re crying
Ronaldo with a goal and two assists
Assist of the year right there
it s almost as good as busquet s assist
Master playmaker Anderson
Hans J rg Butt is the real deal
I m a fan of Tom Carroll s assist to Bale
that is beautiful Robben was certainly lucky to have a guy like Butt helping him to get on the scoresheet
I miss him
He s OUR Anderson now
Prefer this one from Xavi
HAHAHAHA Klopp
Busquet will remind that for the rest of his life He will tell his grandsons about that one for sure
Exquisite passing
here go
Savage
this is a real madrid post get that barcelona trash out of here
you see those men in white
Well real madrid are in the gif
This one too mate http youtu be yWVrolNQ4RU
Talk about being bitter lol
Still bummed out about last weekend
I don t think he s a Madrid fan
Why is this the top comment
Still managed to miss few chances
Decoy90 Okay so where s the real banter
No banter whatsoever I m glad he s back in form but he can be even better
He s just scored again lol But I don t believe he s back in form
Exactly how I feel It s going great for him but it doesn t feel like he s in top form I mean it s two assists and two goals can t be much better on paper but there is room for improvement
Can he even get back to form his knee problem isn t gonna go away with playing more lol
That is an excellent goal
Azevedo still living off his Fifa 13 self because it s clearly not working out for him irl
hahaha 5 skills
Where are the people saying Carvajal isnt offensive
Sweet nutmeg but surely that shove would be a foul right
Best goal of the night for me
Carvajal Danilo
Carvajal is just as good attacking as he is at defending Danilo is just as bad attacking as he is defending
what a goal
Has to be a starter this guy
What a rough game number 66 is having Also great goal from carvajal
What s with the recent explosionin the number of fullback goals
Fullback envy sweeping Europe
I love how he just nutmegs him and as the defender is trying to recover he just shoves him to the side
Isn t that a foul on 66
That was unexpected
hnnng fucking awesome
Yasss
nice curl
I can t tell if that was a cross or a shot Still a sexy goal regardless
Am I the only one for whom none of the streamable links are working right now
Why was the camera so zoomed in Thought it was a replay at first
The Shakhtar defenders find new ways to be crap for each goal
Does anyone have a normal angle Absolutely hate that let s zoom in on one player crap
Carvajal going James on this one
Jesus chris what a belter
What exactly is a belter supposed to mean I always assumed it meant fast hard and direct
yea that wasn t a belter by any means
Goalazo
What a cross
Ronaldo must be pissed at that
deleted
huh
I m surprised to see Ronaldo do those fakes I ve heard that he hasn t done many dribbling tricks recently Or is that just talking about 5 star skill type stuff
He hasn t done any skill to put a defender behind in like i don t even know Those fakes he does them every day
OK I don t really watch Madrid games I d rather not stay up until 5am for a game that isn t Arsenal the Socceroos or a World Cup finalSorry man I know you want to praise your defender but if Sterling put that on target either to Buffon s left or right that would have gone in It was a terrible miss from Sterling no defending could have saved you there

Felix Brych is such a terrible referee woeful calls all across the game Edit Every fucking year as well God fucking damnit
What A Goal
Anybody have any idea what s going on with Hart
Feeling a red card coming The players are getting fed up with it all
Unable to go back since I m relying on other people s streams Normally I would be able to go back into the match to grab that for you but now tonight Sorry mate
Cross was by Alex Sandro

Maybe try selecting a role for him in that position that s what I do So instead of CM Playing position select CM Central Midfielder That s what I do when I want to re train my player and it seems to help
He s still at United in 2018 in my save Getting decent amount of apps but not a key player United did buy Kane in their first season so they play him instead
Getting no yellows is pretty difficult thing to do Your players will make tactical fouls and or lose their head and make rash challenges It s pretty much impossible to not get carded at least once in a game
Can I see your squad I m currently playing with Gent and I m only in 2018 so I m still struggling a bit
Get Zabaleta
HOLY SHIT BOYS THEY DID IT Belgium is proud of you
Pretty fucking stupid that two four steps are guarded
That first minute red card though
Probably Pardew
Fuck I didn t get Bolasie s skill that lost him the ball in itSorry i just went off of what the article said not very knowledgable about Sweden Thanks for correcting that
Thats actually an awesome picture thanks for posting it
After they see how he handles Messi and Neymar at the Euros they will definitely sign him
3978 miles to go see Belgium in a friendly against the US in Cleveland Ohio Well worth it
Jelle Vossen from Burnley to Club Brugge is comfirmed Signed a 5 year contract
LvG s Notes
Ghost corner in Belgian first division game
How about Vidic s double tackle
Belgium put up their tent in Cyprus box hopefully some goals follow real soon here Starting to look like shooting practice out there
De Bruyne Gotze Kagawa
Robot Celebration
Same goes for The Netherlands sometimes they are referred to as just Holland while this is technically not the whole of The Netherlands It would be the same as referring to Great Britain s team as England
I like it but using Fellaini next De Bruyne feels funny to me In the future we d have Thorgan Musonda Jr or Praet for that spot Not that I rate them that highly but just seems like a position better fit for them
I agree with your future midfield line up In 4 6 years Tielemans Malanda Musinda would ve been a massive midfield Kind of like Witsel Fellaini Defour back in Standards days
I feel you My choice for Origi is based on the fact that i feel he will have a growth period in the next two years that will make him more compatible with the players around him like Hazard and De Bruyne He is more unpredictable than Lukaku in the field but I got to give Lukaku credit though As for Benteke he seems to be having trouble finding his form maybe a transfer to a bigger team make change that for him
Belgium for Euros 2016 not much difference from WC2014 GK Courtois RB Meunier CB Kompany CB Alderweireld LB Vertonghen CDM Witsel CDM Niangolan RM Mirallas CAM De Bruyne LM Hazard ST Origi
Probably pretty unknown but Tom De Mul Belgian winger who spent his youth at Ajax similar route as Vertonghen Vermaelen and Alderweireld Managed to get a transfer to Sevilla which wasn t a bad club at the time but couldn t stay fit so retired when he was 28 last year Also Arsenal s Diaby and Spurs s King
They forgot Toby Alderweireld on loan at Southampton from Atletico Madrid and ex Ajax And of course other but thought he deserved a mention since Southampton is second in the BPL atm
I don t know if he counts yet since he hasn t proven himself in a top competition yet but Martin Odegaard is 15 years old and made his debut for Norway s national team already http youtu be Smi8jvNixL8
Thank you This is awesome I didn t know any of this Missed those good years sadly
Thank you so much that s so interesting Didn t know any of this How old was Totti when Real Madrid bid for him
Can someone tell me more about the hype around Totti and Pirlo when they were younger I was way too young to remember how they started out and i feel they ve been left out of this discussion
I feel that PSG would try to bring back Eric Gerits back to France He s familiar with the French way of playing and was a solid coach at Marseille Would be a surprise though Maybe even give Zidane a chance although these two are both Marseille men at heart you never know what money will do
Carlos Puyol will possibly make a good future coach He used to always be driven to steer his fellow team mates to stay focused and play their position correctlyI wonder if the defenders had played that to the end would Ronaldo still had made that weak header or would he have done something different They would ve certainly got to that if they didn t stop playing EDIT Also that defender marking Ronaldo should probably try to keep an eye on his man
Id be furious as a manager if I saw that heck even as a fan Id be mad
heck Please watch your language
it s a family show
I don t give a crud
Just imagine what kind of foul language we d be seeing if he was the manager
You kiss your mother with that mouth
Makes me think of the WC qualifier knockout between Sweden and Portugal Guys this Ronaldo chap is pretty good keep an eye on him
yea to be honest that should have been stopped Also on side note you can clearly see the lack of form he is still in with that attempt on net A form ronaldo would have put a solid effort on net Regardless goal and hopefully it helps him and the rest of us get back up from that loss sat
I know Ronaldo s fast but that afro guy didn t even try there until the pass was already on it s way
that Shakhtar defender
Defender
Hooooooly shit imagine letting the best player in the world run into your box in acres of space Edit I guess I mean one of the best thanks for the downvotes you morons
Wow 20 downvotes for asserting that Ronaldo might be the best player in the world
i mean it really is an absurd contention at this point
Didn t see Messi in the video
What was that number 66 doing
Gee I think that s Ronaldo
Dude couldn t be bothered to track back 10 feet Would have been an easy clearance The center back too looks like he could ve got there but he gets caught giving up before the ball is even in Not that the goal was his fault though
It was actually number 99 doing a handstand
He looks more like a rugby player than a footballer
probably hoping it would lead to a counter attack didn t really work out
that defending reminded me of this IRL lag posted over at r gifs by u fromthepharcyde
He s to my right I got him
What a pass by Bale
Modrics pass That was magic
Wouldn t mind seeing Modric at Bar a
Dude what is wrong with you
The Croatian double team with Rakitic Triple with Kovacic It s sexual
Croatian here By watching them play at the Croatian national team I would say they would do fuck all with all due respect to them they are indivudually amazing players Never seen them mesh together well though
Am I sexuuallll yeeeaaahhh Am I everything you need you better rock your gameplay now
He is a benfiquista
Just thought it would be amazing to see him playing there not that I dislike him at Real
Could anyone explain to me why he s being downvoted to oblivion I m genuinely curious as I don t understand what is going on here S Edit I m relatively unknowledgeable which is why I m trying to learn more
Probably because of the rivalry between Barca and Real It s like saying I d like to see Marcelo at Barca or Pique at Real
Ah okay thanks for the answer I appreciate it
Not sure if he was trying a Nacho goal of his own
Pardon me if this is a joke but Bale was going for goal
LOL yes he did think he missed the goal
Does fantastic to spot the run and then be able to float it over
Much credit to Bale for Cristiano s goal
Huh Bale He made a simple pass which was actually just a wide shot The real credit for this goal should go to Modric not Bale or Ronaldo He created this goal solely Ronaldo and Bales part could be done by a U 13 to be honest
Not sure what U 13 would be able to make that run or chip that Bale did I think you are selling him very short
I don t think you realise which players are which in this clip
Not if you ask Cristiano at least in this clip
Hurr durr ronaldo is so selfish
Le arrogant Cristiano amirite
You idiot Edit that s all I could say initially This 10 second clip wasn t long enough to show the part where he serenades Bale
I would ve broken my skull on that post
As soon as ronaldo started running towards it I got scared
wtf was that dude doing trailing ronaldo as if he wasn t going to score
Well me must ve just thought Oh well in Benitez s system Ronaldo has about 1 5th the shots he usually does Especially now that Neymar Suarez and Messi are playing so well Cristiano likely suspects he won t make the the three man list for the Ballon D Or leading to a loss of spirits which along side his knee injury and age can be attributed to his loss of recent form that is a greater part of his decline No need to follow him here
And then Oh shit
You really put some thought into this huh
Felaini really let himself go
Good team goal
Im glad Bale is looking healthy Hopefully he can keep it up
Inzaghi would be proud
Quite bad defending do they not realize how fast Bale is Great play by Bale and Modric though
They guy covering Cristiano is the true criminal here if you ask me He just kinda watched as Cristiano ran passed him
Oh man what a pass from Modric
Impure
Fck that was close
Madrid doing their best impression of Barca s goal the other day
Tapinaldo
7 10 players would probably miss that
Yeah those open net shots from 6 inches are insanely hard
No they wouldn t
Those passes though
meh
Well that almost ended tragically
I WANT TO HAVE MODRICS BABIES
what is it with defenders just ignoring ronaldo and allowing him to stroll unmarked into scoring positions
Number 66 is good
knock off Marcelo definitely didn t help
wow Modric
the world is a better place when Cristiano Ronaldo is scoring goals
Defender 86 might wanna mark the second best player in the world a little closer than that Just a thought
Neymar played yesterday unless you mean Suarez who also played yeterday
Goddamn can t a guy make a joke on an internet forum without dickheads being all sanctimonious about arbitrary rankings of grown men Fuck s sake
Seems like you can t take a joke either m8
s Just bants man BANTZ
Unless you mean Iniesta
Is he dare I say it Back
Bale assists Ronaldo Ronaldo pretends Bale don t be here
That defender running with Bale was pathetic but he made up for it by kicking the ball out of the goal after it had crossed the line
what the ACTUAL FUCK was 66 doing what the fuck was he thinking
Typical goal by him But that pass by Modric though
Ronaldo goals lack the flair they used to come with These recent ones look like spoon fed boringness
how was the celebration
Reminds me kinda of Barca s fantastic MSN goal yesterday actually Great for Ronaldo though he really needed that bit of confidence
Reminds you in what exactly In both the ball went inside
He s most likely mentioning those over top sort of flick balls into the area
yes that I thought r soccer was football forum where people understood the game lol no
This sub is pretty bad for serious discussion
Only if you have a Real Madrid flair and or try to compare anything other than gods to Barcelona s players
your understanding of the game is so deep man You recognized a forward over the top pass as similar to another goal Can Real Madrid hire you already
Good one jackass
How can you not see the similarities
You tell me
Well both are goals scored in a Champions League football game if that s what you mean
Great for Ronaldo the new kid on the block seems to have the potential to now aim for greater heights and probably play for Segunda someday
Almost scored on the same play ten minutes later but the next time the keeper stayed in goal to save Ronaldo s header
dont thank bale
But all the couch managers here told me that Ronaldo should be benched I don t even know if those people were serious or just blinded by their hate of this man
Good point he really proved everyone wrong by heading it in unmarked from about 6 inches outside the goal World class finish Ronaldo showing his best definitely not Bale and Modric
Only the GOAT can score goal like that
He scored and that s enough Doesn t matter how We can t be 100 sure that this situation and goal would have occurred without Ronaldo Also I am not trying to put Bale or Modric down I m just saying that people that never touched a ball in their lives should not make stupid comments Even if it s biased or because they hate him it s still retarded to say that real should bench him
He scored and that s enough Everything that is wrong with football viewers in the past 5 10 years
You do know that the objective of football is to outscore an opponent If this is wrong with football viewers then what do you suggest is right
Have a holistic view of football Goals and assists are just the final 2 moves in a chain of events I am not gonna pretend that they are not important but to pontificate on them at the exclusion of everything else is what is wrong with football analysis at the moment I blame Messi and Ronaldo
Mate you re making that assumption of me based on this post alone I m not saying that goals are everything I m a defender and love clean tackles more than anything I m just saying when a player especially a forward scores a goal or two then he has done his job
He s hardly proved anyone wrong This is the kind of goal that someone in a slump can score without changing their future performances one bit because it doesn t do shit for confidence If someone who could actually make runs and be a threat offensively had started there is no way to be 100 sure it wouldn t be 0 3 already
Lol the last paragraph is enough for me to understand that you are probably one of those who do not watch his matches regularly but still like to shit on him
Your comment history is enough for me to understand that you have a reputation for starting and encouraging circlejerks in the past I understand it s new for you to be on the other side for once
Yeah unfortunately you ve come across Shaqiriii the one user you can guarantee will be at the bottom of every thread he comments in I d ignore the guy
Oh believe me I know who he is Just another guy who views reddit as a platform for starting arguments
That still does not change what I said You try to get back at me but it does not change that you re probably one of those couch managers that like to speak a lot without knowing much
I actually haven t said shit about Ronaldo before I saw your comment today I just thought you were just waiting for an opportunity to pretend like you re right about Ronaldo even if he doesn t actually perform well
I never said anything about Ronaldo s recent form so no I wasn t waiting for something like this to comment that I was right Check my history if you re bored and that interested in it or take my word for it
Of course not I wasn t implying that all 400k of us in r soccer were just watching for a comment by you specifically But I can guarantee that you had a preformed opinion about Ronaldo s form and you were waiting for anything that you thought would allow you to get upvoted via hivemind Unfortunately for you this isn t enough for a reasonable person to say that Ronaldo has regained his form So you got downvoted
American flair Your argument is invalid
America flair Your argument is invalid
Is it really
Asshole spotted comment worthless
American Real Madrid fan Argument is garbage
And so is your attitude Grow up
Yeah nobody else could ve scored an empty net header Maybe he deserved the bench maybe not but one easy goal against Shakhtar isn t a good indicator
He never deserves the bench Maybe he can be rested in unimportant matches but claiming that he should be benched is just either being biased or clueless Even he plays bad there is no replacement Who would he be benched for
People don t want to bench him because someone else plays better it s because the bench could motivate Ronaldo to work harder and get back in form It s not a difficult concept to understand managers do it all the time with underperforming stars Pique Enrique Hazard Mou
There are different ways to motivate players Playing bad should be enough motivation for him to get back to his level He is a hard worker and dedicated I don t think motivation is the problem Maybe it s his issues with his legs or the managers tactics not clicking but I do not think its motivation Who knows
Man you defend Ronaldo with all your heart Are you his publicist by the way Has he thanked you for it yet
Oh look it s my number one fan Nice to see you too
So I ll take it he hasn t thanked you Man must be hard you must spend several hours on the internet arguing and defending him only for him not to notice
Well at least you get some appreciation from me for being such a good fan So at least one of us is being thanked
TIL defending a player on Reddit being a good fan Damn why didn t nobody tell me going to away games is costly If someone had told me I could show my appreciation to my team just by defending a player on the internet I would gladly save up some money for more important things
Couch managers lol
A lot of Madrid fans who don t hate Ronaldo have also asked for him to be benched so it s not just people who hate this man
Lol madrid fans C mon man a lot of Real and Barca fans here are a bunch of gloryhunters that will turn on their stars as soon as they stop performing It s not only people here even in the stadiums in Spain they turn on their own players It s not like I think that a comment is more believable if a Real fan makes them or the other way around with Barca
I m not talking about reddit look at Madrid forums on the internet read what many are saying and many claim Ronaldo is past it and that he should be benched And yeah like you said the Bernab u as well My point is that people who have said Ronaldo should be benched are not always blinded by hatred like you stated
Fair enough but I said I don t know if they are serious or biased That means that it s worse if they re unbiased and serious in my opinion And both fanbases are not the most stable ones so I take whatever madrid and Barca fans say with a grain of salt
A tap and 5 on Soccer sad
I thought he was past it
Yup that was an incredible finish Definetly shows the true Cristiano is back
Haha I I was just joking

Yes Maybe one of the best there is
True

Like magic
Like FU FU FU FU FU
You know
GERARD DE U LO FE U
no no didn t you watch he likes to fake to his left but then shifts to the right
Humble in the way they have no ego they accept that Ronaldo is superior I m commenting on why the video is specifically beautiful to me Ronaldo being amazing goes without saying
Would you say it s as beautiful as a gay swan Edit Fuck all y all I still think it s funny

A description of how Ronaldo plays Foo foo foo foo foo
And It s gone Children in Africa could ve eaten that ball
Best 9 ever I m not even kidding
It s crazy considering he was at his best when playing for Barcelona before his injuries He was like 21 Imagine how good he would have been without injuries
He was so amazing that even later in his career when he was fat as fuck burdened by years of injuries and hypothyroidism he was scoring like just a regular world class player at Milan and one of the highest scorers in the WC He had set such high standards that all people could talk about late career Ronaldo was how shit he was
Even when at Real Madrid he was amazing yet nowhere near as good as his earlier years A lot of people seem to think his prime was at Real Madrid when he was actually much better at PSV Barca and Inter
Imagine what would happen if he stayed at Barcelona and later teamed up with Kluivert Jesus Christ
One season at Barca 47 goals in 49 games Then he left for a better contract no fucks given
Puskas and Gerd Muller would like a word They d all be up there though
Muller was an excellent goal scorer but that s it The purest poacher the world has ever seen but not a pure 9 like Ronaldo
M ller was pretty good at everything actually His goals were typical poacher goals but he was fairly involved in the game
I want my striker number 9 whatever you call him to score goals If he does it by dribbling past three players and scoring or poaching them it s the same result I would take the flashier one there But Gerd Muller also scored much more goals than Ronaldo so that weighs in his favor I guess for a game in their prime I would take Ronaldo Over a career I d take Muller Puskas was a good mix of both though
It s silly to compare Puskas and Muller to Ronaldo and declare who the better 9 is Let s not act like all 3 didn t put up video game numbers The former two might have scored 3 goals per match with their dicks but I don t think a pure poacher could ever pull that off in Ronaldo s era
Well its whatever works Ronaldo may be one of the best players i ve ever been alive to see but i ve seen better strikers Suarez for one may actually be one of the best strikers i ve seen in a long time in that he s incredibly intelligent incredibly consistent and incredibly athletic The best player i ve ever seen is Messi best playmaker i ve ever seen is a tough one but i d give it to Iniesta or Zidane and best forward is a toss up between Ronaldo or Cristiano Ronaldo Best dribbler has to be Ronaldinho but I ve seen Neymar one up him once or twice Its nice to look at our childhood heroes with a nostalgic nod but Ronaldo s career was plagued with injuries and a little more disappointment than a lot of people care to remember He was the focal point of one of the most talented squads in recent history which is a high honor in itself But as far as pure 9s go i ve seen better Shevchenko for example was a better striker Ronaldo was definitely more talented but goals are goals
u wot
The same people who think Ronaldo is the undisputed best striker of all time ever are the same people that think Ronaldinho is a top 10 player Paul Scholes is the best midfielder of his generation and Zidane is the sleeper hit of his generation There have been better strikers than Ronaldo as early as Thierry Henry in 2004 While his technique was flawless and his athleticism was incredible at one point he merely set the standard a standard that has been reached more than once in the last decade I fully accept anybody people calling him what he is a legend but being il fenomino doesn t make you the best of all time ever His entire career was defined by 8 years 1994 2002 8 nearly perfect years but there have been better scorers better forwards and faster players side then
Rofl Here is Luis Enrique s last week interview about Ronaldo I d seen him on television at PSV and thought wow Then he came to Barcelona He s the most spectacular player I ve ever seen He did things I d never seen before We re now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players but not then
Wow Current Barcelona manager has nothing but praise for former teammate and club legend Ronaldo Seriously People need to relax
Shearer too
Why would you be kidding He is the best number 9 of all time
Suarez will be in with a shout in a few years if he isn t already
how old are you if you don t mind me asking Ive watched r9 in his prime and currently enjoying suarez While suarez will no doubt go down as one of the great forwards R9 will for a long time be the best ever to play in the position There is no arguing this fact what he did back then was ridiculous Remember this was also an era when little touch didn t end of being called a foul An era when slide tackling was such a big part of the game It was a golden era for defenders
Asking his age comes across as a little condescending The things Suarez has achieved especially after only recently coming into a top team are incredible He s a magnificent player and his all around work effort I m sure puts Ronaldo s to shame Suarez is only 28 and if he maintains this level and remains injury free for another 4 years or so then we would truly be talking about one of if not the greatest strikers ever
lol not how i meant it what i meant was if he got a chance to see ronaldo on live tv or even live but yea
Team achievements shouldn t decide which player was better Ronaldo dominated La Liga at age 19 or 20 Suarez was having a good debut season in the Eredivisie at that age I m not sure if your age comment means that you really haven t watched him back in the day but if not I can only recommend watching some video footage of him He really wasn t called el fenoemno for nothing Even after his injury he was still playing on an incredible level so there will always be this big if concerning what could have been sadly And I definitely know how good Suarez is
LOL NO
I m 27 I m the perfect age to have some childhood bias for R9 Suarez is very close if not as good He s been dominating leagues for years
Suarez is not any where near as prolific but the comparison bears merit if only because they have a VERY similar playing style
I m 35 Suarez is miles away from the best Ronaldo The Ronaldo at Barcelona was not just the best player around he totally and utterly dominated the game He was unplayable
He carried mediocre Inter squad to ultra competitive Seria A in his first year only finishing 2nd due to controversial match vs Juve Also carried them to win UEFA cup Suarez is a beast but Ronaldo prior his 2x knee injuries was just on whole another level
controversial Nice euphemism
I think people tend to give more weight to what they see now R9 was truly one of the most dominant players I ve even seen And I m old
The sentiment that Suarez is as good or better as ronaldo was would ve been extremely dumb in the time period between 2010 and 2012 where he helped take Uruguay to the World Cup semi finals and the Copa America title and it would ve been just a tad controversial when he took Liverpool to a second place finish with a POTY worthy display But a treble and a clasico rout later I don t think its fair to undersell him any longer Suarez is exceptional and any notion that he isn t at Ronaldo s level is just weird I m not actually sure if there s anything Ronaldo could do back in the day that Suarez can t do now The only thing separating them is 3 biting incidents and a bit of racism
Ronaldo is still a class above believe it or not The speed power control finishing
not even close
Suarez is awesome deffo 1 striker right now I still believe R9 was the most talented forward out there though He was basically an upgraded Suarez faster stronger with better ball control 34 goals in 37 matches for Barcelona at age 21 Phenomenal And then injuries hit Also is it just me or did Suarez get smaller in Barcelona He was a boar in Liverpool and now he looks lanky
He may look less bulky but he s as strong as ever
Not really Probably not even top 10 since 2000
Name 10 better since 2000 then
I m not really agreeing with u KrisDoolan but this seemed a nice exercise to do so here we go I did not include CR7 because I consider him more a winger than a 9 Otherwise he d obviously be with the 5 guys above Suarez Players I ranked above Suarez ie if I ran a team and had to choose between prime Suarez and prime player X I d go for player X without thinking about it too much Ronaldo Raul Henry Messi Rooney Players that I rank kind of the same level as Suarez with the same reasoning as above I d have to think a long time before choosing between prime Suarez and prime player X Ibrahimovic Shevchenko Van Nistelrooy Drogba Eto o Totti Tevez Aguero Pre Chelsea Torres Benzema
Half the strikers you listed are mostly known for exceptional finishing They are essential for turning a really good team into a great team The wonderful thing about Suarez though is that he brings so much more than just scoring goals to the table He is absolutely essential for Barca s pressing He was playing both finisher and playmaker for Liverpool When Suarez left Liverpool they simply could not fill the hole in the team The other players you mentioned were wonderful players but teams can cope fairly well when they lose strikers like Van Nistelrooy Raul and Shevchenko
Of the prime player X in the first scenerio only Henry Messi and Ronaldo have a case against Suarez Of the 10 in the second pool only Shevchenko has a case Suarez is comfortably better than all the rest Rooney was great in his prime but nothing to write home about Drogba is my fav striker but Anelka was always better he s just a better captain Eto o Tevez Totti and Ibrahimovich are cult icons but they re not without competition Aguero Benzema Torres and Van Nistelrooy have always been effective and efficient but Suarez has always played a much bigger and better role for club and country And Raul wasn t that good Having scoring records doesn t make you the best striker ever He was great but Real Madrid had no problem replacing him or Van Nistelrooy for that matter when the time came I d liken them to Inzaghi great club legend not the best striker None of them compare to Suarez in the slightest
Del Piero Vieri Van Basten Baggio Bergkamp Batistuta They would all be above Suarez I d say
Rooney even at his prime better than Suarez lol
Props for putting in the effort Would take Suarez ahead of Rooney and Raul Also ahead of Shevchenko RVN Dorgba Totti Tevez Torres probably Karim as well Only one on that list I would absolutely without question take ahead of Suarez would be Messi and he s not actually a striker
Ronaldo Henry Van Nistelrooy prime Shevchenko prime Torres Raul Ibrahimovic Eto o Del Piero Aguero
good list you forgot prime Falcao comparing him to Ronaldo fenomeno is just silly they are different worlds
I was going to mention Falcao because he was an absolute monster at Atletico but I believe this is only his second ever season of Champions League football so I was kind of reluctant to put him in there
I d rather have him on my team over everyone else except maybe Henry Ronaldo and prime Shevchenko
Definite no on Van Nistlerooy Shevchenko Torres Raul Eto o Del Piero Aguero Other three are maybe s at best
I m sorry but motherfucking Ronaldo is not a maybe at best I think you re either massively exaggerating how good Suarez is or you don t remember just how good some of those players were Van Nistelrooy especially had a much better scoring record especially in the Champions League likewise with Shevchenko Raul and Eto o
Nostalgic revisionism I think you re overrating a number of those players especially RVN Sheva Raul
Ruud set a number of records for his goalscoring exploits and had an absolutely ridiculous record in Europe same goals per game as Messi and higher than Ronaldo Shevchenko won the Ballon d Or and is Milan s 2nd all time top scorer only behind Gunnar Nordahl It took Messi and Ronaldo until last year to beat Raul s CL goals record He was Real Madrid s top scorer ever until the start of the season Suarez has achieved shit compared to them
Trying not to be biased but you are really underestimating Del Piero one of the best Italian players to every play the game
What could ve been Ironic that both he and Ronaldo arguably the two most promising and best strikers in the world at that time would end up having their career ruined by their knees
I still don t think Brazil would ve won if Ronaldo was fully fit in the final but they would have played much better in attack
Its simple break his fucking legs
Thanks Roy Keane
FOU FOU FOU
Nice Fortunately for them Ronaldo ended up playing one of his worst ever games in that final
Well his name wasn t even on the teamsheet before the match it was a last minute decision to play him Doctor Lidio Toledo revealed the striker had been rushed to hospital after suffering a convulsion in his sleep but cleared to play after neurological and cardiac tests Such a shame really http news bbc co uk sport3 worldcup2002 hi history newsid 1749000 1749324 stm EDIT Also many other theories as to what happened the night before
There s a strong rumour that he was forced to play by sponsors most notably Nike
This
to this day I still believe the rumors that he was poisoned by the French in their hotel
he was definitely not 100 in that match The disparity between the final and the previous games is absurd Like two completely different players
Probably shouldn t have played at all
Cool seeing them all giddy like a fan would be seeing skill like that up close
Why is this unverified
This is amazing
Watching him in his prime was mesmerizing Just simply unplayable regardless of the talent you put against him

OM also lost Fanni and Lemina
Considering how big the population of France is it s strange how they never produced elite teams like Spain England Germany and Italy They ve had sporadic success but nothing consistent
That has nothing to do with population though Portugal has 10 million inhabitants and they have successfull teams in an european scale Aside from PSG french teams are not attractive enough because we do not have enough money to pay premier league like wages due to fiscality low tv rights deals less attractivity
My point is going back to the start of European football why did no huge teams develop in France like they did in other countries The national team wasn t great either until the 80s
Because historically rugby was a bigger sport in France than football
Oh ok I knew rugby was popular in France but had no idea it was actually bigger than football
Higher percentage of the French population plays rugby than in NZ In the south especially it s all rugby country
The french rugby league top 14 is the biggest rugby league in the world
In the southwest this is true but absolutely not anywhere north of the Loire and at least doubtful in the southeast
I don t think there s any way around the fact that France is an outlier The top 4 leagues are 4 of the 5 most populous nations in Western Europe Portugal may have strong teams league relative to population size but they re still well behind Spain England Germany and Italy
I was once told that in France the taxes alone of you declare over 1M income are upwards of 50 and to keep the big names happy and staying in PSG the Qataris actually cover those extra taxes for the players Not sure how true it is though
Not enough money Atletico s budget is comparable to that of Marseille and Lyon and they reached the CL final while OL and OM have a combined 0 1 10 in their last CL games Also was money the problem when Lyon got ONE point out of 6 against Gent When they were eliminated by APOEL When they were eliminated by Astra Giurgiu When PSG couldn t qualify for EL s round of 32 in a group with Slovan Bratislava and Red Bull Salzburg Let me be clear Ligue 1 sucks and PSG s titles have never felt so hollow But quit trying to find excuses for your poor management French football has never been at a lowest point in decades PSG is our only ray of light but then again We are owned by a dictatorship This situation sucks so much I fucking hate it
Actually Atletico s budget is around 190 million euros Marseille for this season has a budget of 125 million euros A huge part of the budget is dedicated to salaries As a fellow french you should know that the fiscality is very high compared to Spain Marseille for instance had to renovate their stadium same can be said for Lyon with their new stadium It is estimated that Marseille lost 26 million euros over 3 years because of that don t know about Lyon but given it is their stadium and they paid for it the loss is huge Also we had to sell key players this summer so we could conform with FFP regulations Gignac left for free Payet Imbula Ayew left Nkoulou and Mandanda will be leaving FOR FREE at the end of the season We can not just pay premier league like wages because we simply do not have the money to Sure there is probably a problem in terms of management but for some reason and probably others I m far from being knowledgeable on the subject we lack the money to compete internationaly Best clubs are the richest that s all
We lack the money to compete internationally How do you explain that Portuguese clubs constantly trample ours That teams from Cyprus eliminated OL and Nice Danish club eliminated Saint Etienne
French clubs tend not to take europa league seriously because there is little financial reward with a huge investment given that there is way more fixtures in an already overbooked schedule See Christophe Galtier comment a year ago or so Portuguese clubs bring very talented players from south america through third party ownership and anyway the transfer fee is low Plus their academy is on point
That s true but I don t what your point is Are you saying that money isn t the main problem and Portuguese clubs are much better managed than us
I was just explaining why they have more success than us with a lower budget
Well that s kind of my point isn t it If we recruited better and if we took Europe more seriously we wouldn t be in this situation
Incomparable
Comparable In 2013 2014 Atletico s budget was 170M Marseille s 130 One went to the Final of the CL the other 0 0 6 in the group stages
Ah I see what you mean although there are other factors to consider as well
Of course of course But we in France always like to blame it on money I m saying that s really not our main problem
It is very strange only one winner in all of European Cup Champions League history
When has the EPL had consistent success in Europe outside of 04 09
Through the 70s and 80s across each competition
How so
A team in the european cup final 9 times between 1975 1985 7 times winners Spread across 4 different teams imagine any league doing the same now
Look up European Cup finals between 1976 and 1985
Ah I took his statement to mean two decades of dominance though I think the run was from 76 84
England were solid from 70 76 dominant from 76 85 and probably would have continued to be for a little while if not for the Heysel disaster
England were solid from 70 76 Might want to extend that window a bit m8 I mean who could forget our stunning Inter Cities Fairs Cup victory over jpesti D zsa in 1969
English and German teams pretty much exclusively dominated European football in the 70s and 80s until Heysel
The fact that almost none of them own their own stadia and rent from local councils really holds them back
Don t forget that Lyon also have Fekir unavailable due to his torn ACL that he got two months ago
Saint Etienne also sold Maximin to Monaco if that counts
So you are saying the league is shit Except for PSG
The league is poor
Ligue 1 is being bought out by the big 4 leagues but it s France s fault Why aren t French clubs offering bigger contracts bar PSG
LOL Clubs can t type rosebud IRL you re pretty much asking why a single mom working as a waitress can t buy a Lambo
Euuh because they don t have the money You know that with all the taxes a player costs to his Ligue 1 club 17 times what he would cost to a spanish club And if the player ends up being injured or shit DNCG will make sure you re relegated France is not Spain
It s France s fault exactly Not French clubs fault Here over 1M a year 50 goes to the country Under it s more complicated but let s say about 25 So if you want a player to earn 5M a year the club has to pay 9 5M approximately And I have probably forgotten A LOT of things I actually don t know shit about this juste it s super high tax here for high salaries Plus French club aren t wealthy compared to English clubs because English clubs are the main problem Spanish German Italian too but mainly English PS I love MKP Was a big fan during the MKP DRG area at MLG

PSG should just start playing David Luiz as striker just for laughs
Fifa irl
That s not healthy
Not for my blood pressure certainly
This kills the Ligue 1
Solution Espanyol and Barcelona to Ligue 1
Blame it on PSG if you want but Lyon only has 25 points after 14 games that s really not a lot for a 2nd
So everyone in the league is bad It s just PSG are average
I d rather say everyone in the league is average beside PSG who are good Nice lost against Ajaccio and Nantes but went to beat Lyon and Marseille for example PSG can afford to keep their best players which brings stability Marseille and Monaco lost half their team during summer Only Lyon kept their players wages were raised but eventually they lost F kir
Didn t Monaco lose half their team due to a change in policy They have plenty of money right They could have retain some players
It s a mixture of things but they definitely did want to mix up their squad a bit to hopefully get a better project going They let go of a lot of prospects that they felt were not panning out like Ocampos for example We lost half our squad because the club isn t very profitable any more Ayew and Labrune tried several times to extend his contract and our owner simply doesn t give a shit any more They netted 50m off of the sales of our squad this summer and she s going to sell as soon as someone offers
Things haven t been going that great for OM a shame that s happening to a team as great as you I really hope you regain your rightful place in Ligue 1
Eh thanks for the kind words but we have no right to anything in the league We get what we deserve and it s not weird that we are doing poorly given the circumstances It looks like Michel finally figured things out last weekend so I m hoping things will begin to improve
They had to sell some to break even per FFP but Martial wasn t supposed to be sold but given the 80 million offer it was impossible to reject
Why does Monaco lose so many players Aren t they still supported by a rich suggardaddy
Beside this divorce story he eventually did not lost half his money to his ex wife as far as I know they have to sell because of FFP AS Monaco because of its history has many fans in the whole France they ve one of the best away crowd But the home stadium is empty because Monaco is small and full of rich people And this can t work with FFP
He s lost basically nothing to his wife she is in huge debt and will have to completely capitulate at this point he has offered her half of what he originally offered her at the beginning of proceedings and only for 10 years rather than the rest of her life and she ll have to take it His daughter sided against the mother and basically shot down most of her case The issue is that he is happy to spend money as he has shown but he will not spend money if it means he ll have to pay millions in fines to UEFA so the policy shifted from big name star signings to young players with a lot of potential and Jardim with complete control of the squad and transfers along with a Portuguese scout he brought with him They buy low sell high and it will allow a core of players to develop and sell off one or two each season to cover the loss a like Lyon 10 years ago except a bigger safety net So they sold a lot of players one more than they wanted to Martial but obviously with 80 million on the table it was impossible to reject but the project isn t over
Yup you explained their change of policy and their new project well The only thing is that given the context it s even more difficult to create a chemistry between players in Monaco imo They had it last year and they sold everyone I doubt they can create this every year And when you bring in so many new players the risk is to miss on the CL spots Less exposure for the players and you can t sell too high beside they don t buy thaaat low they buy pretty high and want to sell very high
Makes sense I just wish that they d balanced the team better I mean yeah sell Martial for that crazy fee but then buy a good centre back and a good LB RB and another DM Then they d probably be okay Instead they have like 20 wingers and attacking midfielders and two 35 year olds playing defence
Sugardaddy that lost half his money to his ex wife IIRC
That wasn t true actually
Ok my mistake then The thing is he doesn t want to spend huge money on Monaco now so they are more a seller club than a buyer like any club in France other than Lyon or Paris The fact that English clubs are drunk with money that the french taxes cost a lot to the clubs makes the best players of the league go away and team are constantly rebuilding Plus this season PSG are performing good and all the others quite badly explaining this Actually PSG point per game is lower than Bayern per instance but Lyon has really few points for a 2nd after 14 games
We play bad while PSG play how they should with the budget they have They only have 2 draws and no loses so far
Mid and low table clubs are doing surprisingly well hello Nice and Angers Top table clubs are doing quite bad JUST LOOK AT MY CREST
It s that PSG is excellent and that other middle sized team especially Lyon Marseille and Monaco had a pretty rough start
Off topic but I can t wait to see Red Star get promoted and have a Paris derby in Ligue 1 do you think it could happen soon
Red Star is currently 6th 4 points behind Metz 3rd I honestly think it s going to be complicated this year especially since the games have to be played in Beauvais as Stade Bauer doesn t suit the league s standards But for a club like Red Star there s no need to rush sometimes it s better to spend a few years in Ligue 2 before playing with the big boys especially because of DNCG Red Star doesn t have a strong financial back up like Paris FC with fuckin Vinci
Seriously We don t blame it on PSG because we want we blame it on PSG because this is without a doubt entirely their fault PSG fans have nothing to do with it though you can t expect them to want their team to not win every game
PSG fault if teams like Lyon or Marseille underperform terribly They should have much more points by now and this thread wouldn t exist Lyon Marseille Monaco all have budgets above 100M Caen and Angers 25M Lyon lost against La Gantoise I think it s around 30M Those teams are underperforming I can t see how this is without a doubt entirely PSG fault
Can we just stop the season and call it a wrap right now I mean we all know what s going to happen the rest is just filler crap like Dragon Ball Z
Nah dude it s too interesting for us We could be top 6 or relegated nobody knows
I for one hope relegated Imagine the clusterfuck
Honestly it would just be the current clusterfuck amplified a bit and might even help get the club sold So oddly enough I m not as afraid of that as I should be Besides won t you miss the Aluas Labrune bantz
Imagine Aulas twitter with Labrune in Ligue 2 though That s just sounds like Christmas
I think we re forgetting there probably would be no more Labrune if we were relegated at least there better not be He could go to ASSE for continued banter
I would be ok with that even though CL football may kill us straight away
On the one hand Lyon have 25 points in 14 games so 25 42 which is poor for second place On the other PSG have 38 42 which is also huge That s what leads to such a disparity an extraordinarily good 1st place team but also a very mediocre second team
That is one of the consequence of the EPL being so rich The best french players used to leave France for the big 4 now they even leave top 5 teams in France to play bottom teams in England The only team that can keep its players is PSG Then english fan complain that it is easier for PSG in champion s league because Ligue1 is uncompetitive But you created the monster
Let s see there s Thauvin going to Newcastle the Ayews going to Swansea and Villa Hazard and Zouma going to Chelsea so yeah players from top 5 teams in France are leaving to play for relegation zone teams except for Swansea of course
You glossed over Payet to West Ham Azpilicueta and Remy to Chelsea
Remy left Marseille for QPR
He took the long way
I think the conversation was only about bottom half teams so fair shout on the Chelsea ones but Payet is going to a much more relevant club in West Ham which is understandable
Amavi Vertout to Villa as well
I spy the hidden bantz
Big 4 being Real Barca Bayern United
Maybe he means big 4 in England Arsenal Chelsea City United in recent memory
I think in this context the big 4 refers to Arsenal Chelsea United and Liverpool
Sky 4
Arsenal Leicester City United FTFY
Arsenal Leicester City United Leicester City so good they take up two spots in the top 4
No dude I was talking about Bristol City
Wait not Norwich City the ones who put a mighty 2 past Newcastle and constantly produce goals of the season
Fucking Norwich Hell no
I think he meant Lyon Marseille and maybe Lille and PSG
What are you talking about We had to sell Gameiro Nullifying our chances of european victory forever
Kind of off topic but what the hell happened to Lyon They used to be a top team in Europe and roll Ligue 1 year after year and now they are bottom of their group in the CL behind powerhouses like Zenit and Gent and haven t won the league since 2008
Lyon had a formidable upcoming in the mid 2000 s Very well managed They started making good money and saved it Then they for some unexplained reason they splashed all of their cash on Kader Keita 2007 16 Million Ederson 2008 14 million Jean II Makoun 2008 14 million John Mensah 2008 9 million Michel Bastos 2009 18 million Yoann Gourcuff 2010 26 5 million Pretty much every single one of them was a flop Then they decided it was the perfect time to build a stadium BOOOM
All you need to know
This is a good perspective but really only addresses the past couple seasons I m wondering more why they went from historically dominant in the mid 2000 s to where they are now Certainly the rise of PSG and their unlimited funds has something to do with it in the most recent seasons but they were falling from glory even before that for some reason They won 7 straight titles from 2002 2008 which is pretty amazing
they are bulding their own stadium so their last big transfert 30m was hm gourcuf in 2010 but he fails with injurys less than 30 full games played in 5 five years since 2011 they are only on young players and own formation lacazet fekir grenier gonallon martial but sold to monaco like arsenal did during many years
But we went to finish second in the ligue with 8 of our starter being formed at the club Lopes Umiti Gonalons Ferri Tolisso Grenier Lacazette Fekir If only we could form more defender instead of buying shitty player for 8 millions But guess they don t sell for the same amount so are not worth
They started overpaying for average players That s what shocked me the most And when talks about FFP began they decided to invest on a new stadium which will be finished soon Meanwhile they mostly had to rely on their academy players Ligue 1 s lack of attractivity didn t help them As well as the rise of Bordeaux and Lille

PSG have been able to sleepwalk through the league so far Even their bad performances have been mostly unpunished This is more indicative of the exodus in talent this year I don t expect it to stay this way next season
Yeah especially since many PSG players will play this summer You could see last season that PSG poor start was due to the players being tired and injury proned after the World Cup While OM players looked very very strong physically
Remember when they lost to Caen last year Good days
Owww you
I surely do inb4 it happens again
It s like when I play FIFA Career Mode on intermediate
Can t get away from the viral Bernie Sanders marketing anywhere on this site
Reddit has to do it because no one else will Hillary will probably win the nomination pretty easily in the real world she is much more recognizable Not that I would mind Sanders as president but this site is it s own little bubble You would have thought Ron Paul was going to be president last time this was the only place you read about American politics
I was just having a good natured pop at our old troubling but useful friend Modern Capitalism
First time I ve been on Reddit for Months and live in a Red State Bernie is pretty popular Favorite to win the Democratic nomination No At this point he is more than a dark horse However will young people get out to vote in the primaries History says probably not
PSG seem like they really need Ronaldo next season
How s that
It was sarcastic There s a lot of speculation over Ronaldo going to PSG and clearly PSG seem to be doing fine without one of the best players on the planet
I believe he s referring to how Real Madrid are starting to play worse with him on the pitch than if someone else who is younger and not nursing a chronic knee injury would be playing
Lyon won Ligue 1 7 times back to back this is nothing
Without having a Qatari daddy And we never steamrolled it
Without having a Qatari daddy Hmm Lyon went public Stock market daddy Also let s not forget OL Coiffure and OL Taxi

well that s ligue 1 we re talking about
This is a really cool stat fact
Noice
Inb4 PSG is ruining the league
You fucking are though Like seriously I like that you re playing well in Europe but watching the league is a fucking chore with your Qatari whores ruining the integrity of football
Your club did the same for 7 years though And you used to buy the best players from Ligue 1 thus weakening the league
Oh yeah totally similar situations Aulas is some foreign prince that injected a shitload of money in the club There s a difference between strategic presidents and sugar daddies
Precisely situations are not the same Lyon bought the best players from other Ligue 1 teams to secure their 1rst spot every year PSG brings in international stars which increases the TV rights on par with Germany can you imagine which makes more money for Lyon and the other clubs PSG does have shitload of money It doesn t mean this money isn t used as wisely as it can be QSI s strategy is pretty neat if you ask me Aulas is the best president in France It doesn t mean he didn t make big mistakes that cost a lot to OL Cissoko 15M remember
Lyon bought the best players from other Ligue 1 teams to secure their 1rst spot every year You re saying that as if it was easy and we just overspent everbody else they wanted to come here because they believed in what Aulas was creating most of them at least because had we ended up getting Pauleta or Drogba we d probably have a CL Budget wise PSG and Marseille were close to us Nowadays PSG spend 5 times more than anybody else that s not comparable We bought Essien Malouda and Abidal when they were unproven outside of France to Bastia Guimgamp and Lille not really contenders back then Paris buys Ibra Di Maria D Luis Cavani Thiago Silva just the same right We dominated because other big clubs were badly ran now the other big clubs don t even have a chance
Yeah you have some good points Although I think Aulas didn t really want Pauleta he just wanted to destabilize PSG back then by offering him a lot of money Essien Malouda and Abidal are good examples Shame you couldn t capitalize on the successes of this policy who knows what your budget would be like today Instead Aulas started overpaying for average players He was also unlukcy with Gourcuff Ofcourse with all this money PSG is supposed to lead the league But this thread is about those 13 points between PSG and Lyon This shows more about how the other big clubs are underperforming And honestly Marseille and even Lyon since a few years are badly run too
How are we badly run We had to trim the salary bill a lot starting around 2011 to pay for the new stadium so Aulas gambled on going young and we have finished 4 3 5 2 in those rebuilding years now we re back to regular spending We ll see if we can consistently play the CL now
Mostly the choice of players and the money spent to bring them since a few years including this summer with the exception of the very last few seasons when you pretty much entirely relied on your youth system You save money for years and you splash it out to bring it Beauvue and Valbuena Brilliant choice Glad if you re satisfied with that
Don t forget about Yanga Mbiwa He cost them around 10M if I m not mistaken
So one bad transfer window analyzed after 4 months makes a club badly run K Also splash it out Under 10M combined so David Luiz s left arm That s making it rain
Strong but fair Like a tackle from Puyol
Except the fact that Lyon havent exactly beng doing well in the league have they Lyon dont play PSG every week so cant blame them there same goes to all the other teams Last year Lyon finished 8 points behind PSG in the league with monaco only 4 points behind Lyon That seems like a pretty normal league standing doesnt it Same thing happened with Chelsea last season City finished 8 behind them Would you say Chelsea are ruining the league This Fuck PSG they are ruining the french league circle jerk needs to fuck off Everyone under PSG is under performing compared to last season and thats not PSG s fault is it Monaco have spent a shit load to get to where they are and no one complains about them
Paris under performed a lot in the league last year and they still had 8 points over a team which surprinsingly over performed
So its their fault Got it When Chelsea went undefeated for a massive amount of time last year were they ruining the league The teams under PSG are dropping a lot of points and Lyon has only 7 wins from 14 games Thats half of their games have been dropped points and they are 2nd Like I said just because the rest of the league is under performing isn t PSG s fault Bayern Munich have been very solid in recent years are they ruining the Bundesliga
Why are you bringing up Chelsea and Bayern The point is when a team overwhelmingly dominates financially every other member of the league it s playing in there s obviously no surprise on who s going to win It s like Juve s year in Serie B every other team knew they weren t playing for first place So yeah in a sense you can argue that it s ruining the league because even on match day 1 there s no suspense on who will end up winning
Im bringing up Chelsea and Bayern because they are relatively similar to PSG Bayern have been dominating the bundesliga for years but no one crys about them do they Do they say they are ruining the league What about Chelsea they were undefeated for a good portion of last year and were unchallenged really and have spent a lot compared to other teams but once again no one says they ruin the league So whats with all the PSG hate Ligue 1 teams under PSG are under poerforming and you cant deny that even though you dont mention it at all You can talk about PSG ruining the league but Monaco spent a shit load of money to get to where they are now and like I said just because you spend money doesnt guarantee success you guys were 8 points from them last year and were on top at one point so what there What about when Atletico Madrid won the league They arent exactly even financially when it comes to Madrid Barca are they I dont know where the circle jerk came from but there are so many teams that the same could be said about but PSG seems to get all the shit
Decades of success domestic and European got Bayern there There are about 4 5 different teams in England with financial means comparable to Chelsea s so it s competitive PSG has no competition in the league and got there because some guys decided to invest hundreds of millions in a club How is that fair estimate by Le Parisien of clubs operating budget for this season They spend as much as the next 4 combined how am I supposed to believe we or anybody else can compete
They spend as much as the next 4 combined how am I supposed to believe we or anybody else can compete Because you came within 8 points of them last year Even so it still doesnt explain dropping points in half of your games this year you cant blame you being 11 points behind on PSG you guys are playing poorly Also Man City and Chelsea spend considerably more than other teams bar united but they arent succesful in recent years so its not really competitive between 4 teams then is it
This is inevitably what happens when one team in a league has ambitions to step up to compete at elite level and gets the funds to do so CL has severely distorted national leagues in the last 10 years Even if Lyon or OM were performing as expected they still would be unable to maintain over the course of a season i e look at 14 15 So I can totally see the point of people getting angry about this when it is clear that no other team has the means to challenge
They don t have more ambitions they have a fuckload more money than us
Yeah wanting to win the Champions League and building bit by bit a squad capable of doing it that s not ambition at all
Where did I not say that I hate ambition arguments that fans of massive clubs use to blame other teams for a lack of competition I just meant it s what is to be expected when one team is chosen by the Arabian oil gods to get rich and challenge at a continental level The owners don t give a fuck about the domestic league
You know that s not true if Fournier had any ambitions you wouldn t finish 4th of group H against Valencia Zenit Gent Yes the lack of money is an issue but it s not the only one Ligue 1 teams have recently 5 years underperformed in European Competitions Now PSG became a rich club in Ligue 1 with mostly foreign players and reach quarter finals every year If we had more than 3 French players in the starting squad I don t think we would go far in CL Lyon did poor investments during their mercato You were unlucky to loose F kir but a club can t rely only on one player You kept an average manager who hasn t any European competitions experience I don t see any ambitions at all when I see Lyon picking ex Marseille average footballers or the 2nd choice from Serie A PL
You kept an average manager Who finished second in his first season after taking a team that finished fifth the previous season And you are the epitome of a PSG fan Oh so poor investments why didn t you buy Neymar or Boateng You can afford that We buy fucking second string Serie A and PL players because it s the best we can afford This isn t fucking Football Manager where we can buy some kid from Brazil and expect miracles this is real life I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us
why didn t you buy Neymar or Boateng We buy fucking second string Serie A and PL players because it s the best we can afford Kader Keita 2007 16 Million Ederson 2008 14 million Jean II Makoun 2008 14 million John Mensah 2008 9 million Michel Bastos 2009 18 million Yoann Gourcuff 2010 26 5 million You are the epitome of a OL fan Arrogant pretentious and ignorant T es vraiment un gros gros mais alors un gros de chez gros blaireau toi
come on guys hug it out um marchons marchons
I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us I don t see that happening anytime soon
I will dance the day when Qatar finally pulls out like Canal did because you all of you arrogant pretentious ignorant PSG fans can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us And then Ligue 1 can go the way of the Eredivisie or the Brasileiro Sure routinely losing your best footballers as soon as they show the slightest bit of potential will hurt the league more than the investment QSI has brought tv package comparable to Germany and not too far off Spain benefiting everyone but at least PSG won t have a lot of money
can go down to Earth and be shit like the rest of us What a great comment
Woeful league save Zlatan and get him out of there A S A P
That s the most inaccurate comment on Ligue 1 I ve ever seen in here
It s difficult to make any accurate comment when you are being overwhelmed by hormones I mean give the poor guy a break suddenly becoming pubescent is a very unsettling thing in someone s life
Ok without us Ligue 1 Arsenal would be a shit club but whatever
To be fair so would many teams in the Premier League
Especially Newca oh they re already shit
Another flop in the CL and PSG will surely start to lose their financial backing French football is abysmal
French football is abysmal but I m not sure PSG have really flopped in the CL in the past few years We got trampled by Barcelona last year but well who didn t
The year before that they lost to us on away goals and the year before it was Barca also on away goals Hardly flops pretty unlucky in all honesty
And the quarter finals the year before knocked out by a dominant Chelsea
Boring leagueModric s first goal from inside the box with Madrid
luka modric scores me wipes away tear with one hand and fist pumps with the other while silently mouthing my boy
He s just a player that s hard to hate It s crazy to think that If he didn t score that wonder goal vs Manchester Utd a few years ago that he probably would have been sold
My bae
Watching modric score is like watching an angel get its wings
was this his first goal inside the box for real madrid
yes
was the keeper under arrest
Just got my Modric kit in the mail yesterday perfect timing His tempo today was great very good linkup and forward pressing
Lukas first goal in over a year
Fuckin finaly He has so amazing shot and he just never uses it for some reason
Gorgeous finish
Modrulja is best D
Why wasn t that initial pass to Ronaldo offsides Isn t he well past the last defender
deleted
good run beats his defender coming back splits two defenders and puts the ball where only his teammate can get it meanie
You re an idiot
Padding
you got downvoted because you re hiding behind taht spain flair
deleted
No Ronaldo Assist He should pass more Ronaldo Assist He should pass more Ronaldo single handedly saves the world He should pass more
Ronaldo single handedly saves the world He didn t celebrate with his teammates
deleted
Yeah he should stop saving the world all the time and concentrate on football
I mean it s either assist or no assist right So yeah not gonna be 33 each
He will never be without detractors no matter what he does When you reach the level he has reached you re gonna be under a damn microscope for everything you do I do not envy that sort of pressurePogba is killing us here
Pogba has been going off this game
If people think that was a foul just never watch football again If you can t have those battles then football is a lost cause Otamendi just got beat
Think he was trying too hard to get a foul called
Hard to say from this particular clip to be fair
LOL at Otamendi 2nd awful error against Juve
pretty garbage positioning and looked outmuscled by mandzukic of all people for much of the game
Actually outmuscling defenders and beating them physically in the air and on the ground is an area Mandzukic excels in So it shouldn t come as a surprise that he of all people gives center backs trouble in those situations
I don t see much of Mandzukic so you may be right that he punches above his weight but Ota was totally out of position and will need to do better Mandzukic is smaller than most EPL strikers
6 4 is small for a PL striker nowadays
Google says 6 2 and 185 pounds He s slightly bigger than I thought but shouldn t be outmuscling Otamendi
And Otamendi is 6 and 180 pounds
No but compared to Neymar and Messi and Suarez and Dybala and Aguero he s definitely a stronger striker of all people Strikers aren t usually known for being massive punishers
But center backs are expected to be strong Mandzukic has 5 pounds on suarez who is the same size as otamendi He just ain t that big
Centrebacks are supposed to be strong yeah Everyone s agreeing with you there The reason you re getting downvoted by people is because you used the phrase of all people which implies that Mandzukic is weak compared to other strikers Yeah he might struggle to outstrengthen a lot of center backs but compared to other strikers he ain t weak
The whole game he was getting outmuscled ref bailed him out most of the time though
I really didn t see why he gave half the fouls I cracked up when he gave that last foul against Marchisio still don t get what the ref was thinking XD
That run from Pogba
65 metres according to the french broadcast I was watching
Fuck I forgot about this game why the hell am I watching PSG
Weak defending but cracking cross
Pogba and Sandro have been playing so well recently
Otamendi one of the strongest defenders around complaining about that contact is just laughable
i ve watched every city game he s played and haven t seen anything to suggest he s one of the strongest defenders around or did you not mean physically strong
Not sure if it was a foul by Mandzukic or not but the skill by Pogba and cross by Sandro were both excellent
Could have possibly been a foul but you ve got to expect your center back to be stronger than that
Heh that s exactly what the commentators just said
Does that mean I should be getting paid for this
Can t be worse than the clowns commentating now
Anyone have Pogba s drop on De Bruyne
So happy to see super Mario score
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot to me he s been the best player of the first half Now I just wish Khedira can stay healthy and keep Sturaro off the field
Sturaro was pretty damn good today He recovered so many balls
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot He has been for a while but Allegri is attached to Evra for his consistency and alleged defensive superiority
Pogba running like a gazelle
Great cross Mandatory comment about the coefficient
I think this is the third consecutive assist for Sandro Evra s been good but this guy is just better
what a cross from Sandro
Love Sandro I wish we could have attempted to get him He s been one of the most complete young left backs for a while
Funny that he underperformed in the last season here
Yes Indeed the young man is an excellent footballer
does Pogba ever celebrate
Beautiful cross in Deserved the goal
And sadly Sandro is always on the bench
Doubt he ll be there much from now on though
He got subbed off today to his second consecutive standing ovation from our fans He s definitely making a great case for himself and there s no doubt in my mind that he ll feature quite regularly from now on
great assists 2 games in a row also very solid in defense he s fighting for it
looked quite a bit like Baba s pass to Oscar yesterday Lovely ball
That cross couldn t have been more perfect
Pogba has been amazing so far in this match hoping he scores
I love how quickly goals appear on here
Alex Sandro s cross had eyes
The defense of De Bruyne on Pogba was just horrible He put himself between the ball and the sideline instead of the ball and the door
Great cross What happened to the defender there though
Otamendi choked hard
Mogo si se bacit na glavu
Yyyyyyeeesssss Way to step up mandzukic
What a cross
Makes me miss Darke for world cup games
Vintage poacher Mandzukic
Does Otamendi think he is Ronaldo
Great cross from pogba sandrp pogba is looking good so far in this match
Pogba didn t cross it The commentator even said Alex Sandro as he crossed the ball
Ohh corrected it thanks

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsI expect Chelsea to improve marginally I have trouble seeing where the magic fairly dust that turns the clock back to last season comes from
You are what your record says you are Mahatma Ghandi
If you think I ve been unfair in mocking the Blues here s a neutral version to share with your Chelsea supporting friends https drive google com file d 0B ZcVoqtapgRNC1kT1RvbEZSYUk view usp sharing edit to add ugh does not display well in Sheets You ll have to use Excel
Hadn t planned on it but it should be easy Only problem is I don t know which supporters to pick on in other leagues p
If you beat Spurs this week I ll eat my hat Unrelated note I wear pizza as headgear
In isolation yeah catch any one of the teams ahead of you is plausible Catching all 11 of the teams in between Chelsea and 4th place well This seems beyond your grasp though I also give up p
This I agree with If the cups go toward the big fish Chelsea may well nick the EL Or if they win a cup themselves
Now that s a hot take
A lot of time and matches remain and Spurs still are a Harry Kane ACL away from a serious problem don t count your cockerels before they hatch
spits in hand offers to shake
The math nerds Ok Michael Caley and whoever does stats com put 4th on around 66 points the average is around 68 There s a lot of compression at the top since the appointed breakaway pack some subset of United City and or Arsenal has thus far refused to breakaway Plus also the computers are positively glitchy about Leicester They still have a lot of but it s Leicester in the model The models tend to weigh the previous seasons results and lessens it over time as the current season s results are factored in Frankly I don t trust the models regarding 4th place so I m inclined to agree with you If Leicester is s posed to be lower on the table that means that they points they do have have taken away from the other top clubs Gross oversimplifcation just happened So maybe we ll see a lower 4th place point total For reference the lowest in the 20 team era is 60 and the highest is 79
I ll take that bet if Chelsea do make the top 4 I ll eat a very spicy taco
I ll take a bet on either if you want
Or to put the Chelsea question in isolation What is your over under on total points for Chelsea this season
We ll see I like Everton to go on a tear I haven t watch enough Southampton to rule out a run and yeah West Ham is probably at their highwater mark If I were a betting man I d take the following clubs to finish higher than Chelsea Arsenal Man City Man United Spurs Liverpool Everton and yes Leicester Which four of those am I wrong on p And I have a newsflash Chelsea s not winning on Sunday p
It matters a lot because Chelsea is not the only candidate to make a huge run from the middlebottom of the table Everton looks good Liverpool looks good Southampton is well they may or may not come good it s hard to tell It does Chelsea no good to go on a massive run and achieve 68 points if 4th place is now 70 because someone got a hot hand 68 is not the finish line it s just a statistical point where half the 4th place team finished ahead of it kind of You are betting on Leicester falling back AND Spurs AND Everton AND Southampton AND Liverpool AND even the Hammers sure why not all dropping so many more points while Chelsea performs at last year s level suddenly and without any sort of reason to believe other than well belief I mean support your club and all but well yeah
Some other interesting things besides Chelsea p The bar gets even lower if 6th or even 7th are in the mix if the cups fall to high placed teams then the doors are open for Europa Everyone thinks Leicester will fall back to earth but I still like them for Europe Yes they have a daunting run to finish the front half but that just means they also have 13 matches reversed fixtures in their future where they glorped up 28 points on the first pass If they have another 25 28 points in them plus a few more around 7 9 from murderers row they can make 63 And if the top finishers get the cups they won t even need that many Leicester on Thursday nights What a world From West Ham to around Stoke if any of those teams go on a surge they are suddenly in play for nicking the last CL or the top EL spot It s wide open a few unexpected wins here or there Aston Villa are in deep shit DEEEEP shit They have 5 points in 13 matches 0 38 ppm They need to be more than 3 times better to get their nose into clean air I wonder what the lowest points after 13 matches that didn t get relegated was
Which is why I included the 80 target The math nerds on twitter agree that the champ this season might not make 80 whoever they are
I had that in but I dropped it maybe I should in future editions
Man City had one team to catch That team stumbled and City ran them down Chelsea has to eclipse 11 teams of 14 teams to claim fourth Sure they have almost 4 times as long to catch them as City did United but it s just too many clubs Plus they ve shown nothing on the pitch thus far that indicates there are a hair from making the switch from 1ppm to more than 2 1 ppm
I think it s sort of mad to consider it but if Chelsea can average 2 1 points per match for the rest of the way they ll have earned it no doubt
HHHHRRRGGGGAAAAHHHHH Oh sorry had a nightmare there for a second
I want Dembele with Dier maybe not as dynamic going forward although I think he s starting to get the value of passing forward p but Dembele is as smooth as butter on the ball and denying Chelsea a whiff of any takeaways up the pitch is quite valuable On Sunday I prefer Hugo Kyle Toby Jan Danny Mousa Eric Erik Christian Heung Min Harry It s not as dynamic as other options but it s stone cold hard defensively with enough up front to get the requisite 2 goals
Bah they were better than Norwich and Maccabi Tel Aviv Forgive me if Chelsea squashing bugs doesn t exactly fill me with dread When they ve played teams with some talent lately Loss to Stoke Loss to Liverpool Loss to Stoke on pens Loss to West Ham During that same span they got a win and a draw against Dinamo Kiev scoring a grand total of one goalibrahimovic substitution

CamaradonaAhh thanks Your connection helped me find this The use of grass as British slang for a police informer dates back to the 1930s and is apparently a short form of the slang term grasshopper meaning the same thing Grasshopper itself is rhyming slang for either copper i e a police officer or shopper one who shops sells information to the police
You can hover over a crest to see the team name
It s no surprise that Sandro getting more regular minutes has coincided with Mandzukic looking more dangerous He could prove to be an important striker for us this season
What does grass mean when used in this context
Omar s version including Pogba wrecking De Bruyne https streamable com 774n
Unfortunately not
Probably his best performance of the season
The people who say that are those who have only seen the Vines
Sandro is making his claim on the starting spot He has been for a while but Allegri is attached to Evra for his consistency and alleged defensive superiority
That was headed for the corner flag
Oh come on put this game to bed already
Lo stile Juve
Bit selfish from Morata there He did the hard work but if he passes to Dybala there the game is over And right off the back if that Sterling nearly scores at the other end
To be fair he doesn t need to work on his attacking game too much to reach Gattuso s level
On loan though your point still stands
Yep we play it after every goal at home
It was
Sounds like it s the only game you ve ever seen
Morata nearly gifted them a goalscoring opportunity there
Come on Mandzu
Haha can t blame you for trying Barza

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsBeating Barca and Madrid was about the only noteworthy thing they did this season They ve been poor in the league too
saw today how good they can be What you mean go down by 4 goals Conceeding 3 goals in 10 minutes is much more indictative about how bad Madrid s defense is rather than how good Shakhtar is Especially considering the fact that Madrid have conceeded 10 goals in their last 3 games
That s becasue the whole league was affected by the war
Or maybe how the players are affected by the war You think it s a coincidence how many Brazilians are leaving the team They re afaird for a reason you know They had to fucking move stadiums and the club s owners are running out of cash to support the teams
I mentioned Ronaldo because the guy I was replying to talked about Ronaldo
lol Portugal and Netherlands
A win by BATE could send them through the R16 IMO Roma and Bayer have been shockingly poor this year I expected a lot better from them
I m not pinning it on anybody
Mate this is against a team in a war torn country He has dissappeared in all the big games this year Atletico Sevilla PSG Barca
lol these English commentators Sagna clearly got Dybala on the foot
Well upon future research it appears they went to Budapest instead of Bucharest and the final was in Bucharest Other than that it s true
If they re gonna rotate then why even start Ronaldo He needs the rest the most
I remember when this huge group of Athletic fans flew to Bucharest for the EL final Except that the final was in Budapest
all that means is that Bayern is a team full of chokers
UEFALONA
Youth development If Sergi Roberto and Rafinha can turn into world class players and he wins us another CL then I d rate him over Pep
Holy shit Barca s wage structure is out of control I really hope that Iniesta is the second dot and not Neymar or else we re gonna be in big trouble in thre coming years
Who s the outlier for United I know for Barca it s probably Messi Neymar and for Madrid it s Ronaldo but who s earning that much for United Rooney
Isn t Ribery still injured
Yeah just support Columbus then If you re looking for an European team just pick some team from the top leagues Spain Germany England Spain is perfect because the kickoff times aren t so damn early in the morning Go research stuff on Wikipedia and watch some La Liga games to decide Laola1 tv has free streams if you can get a German IP

Always round up with the exception of stoppage time where it would be for example 45 1 If a goal is scored 15 01 into the game that is in the 16th minute

Right but why is a counter strike pro playing football
Akinfeev is having a bad day
Akinfeev s trying to restore Sch rrles confidence huh
I hope he does He s one of those players who I inexplicably like even though I ve never supported any of his clubs nor his country
It s that perfect aryan thing isn t it
Those blue eyes show me all the could be pure in this world
Ty Akinfeev
That wasn t even a shot he was trying to settle it
I kind of wish we still had him
No you don t He has been dreadful
He just seems like a nice guy And I had hopes he could come good for us after his bad spell
We definitely do He was our only attacking midfielder that actually made runs in behind the defence and had a strikers instinst And he was an excellent finisher
The tense of this comment is bothering me more than it should
Why It s fine
He edited it It was in present tense
thank you based wolfsburg
looks a bit like his goal against PSG happy for him
Looks similar to the Torres goal he assisted vs Bayern
a bit but the bounces for torres s goal was higher

What has Rabiot s mom been feeding him lately
https twitter com Ibra official status 669493486056513536
Alves has had five great months of play in the past two years terrible from 2013 to mid January 2015 then he played to a world class level going into the Copa Am rica and his defending has been bad this season Only reason why he is still at Bar a is because they couldn t sign anyone else otherwise he would have left in January
cba watching the rest of this game i literally just saw Kobe brick an open fadeaway with 4 22 left in the third quarter and then Ezeli scored an alley oop 9 seconds later
Hibbert GOAT rim protector
honestly Kobe is being forced to take so many bad shots so many bad misses but the Lakers are AIDS
i assume this guy is in uni which means it definitely will take longer than 15 minutes the problem is that in most cases you have to absorb and analyze a lot of information and when you are limited to 450 words it s difficult to be concise whilst covering all the bases recently i had a business law assignment which was worth 20 of my grade it could only be 500 words it s difficult to really cut down from 750 words to 500 without losing key aspects of your arguments
Chuck is laughing but in his head he s like wtf bruh
GSW are going to win by 60
Kobe drops at least 30 points condition he isn t injured at any time Lakers win if i m wrong i ll buy you gold for one month if i m right you buy me gold for the next three months which one of you will take me up on this once in a lifetime offer edit 6 3

Ohhhh ya beauty its Flamini
OH MAN WHAT A GOALSo much room for activities
This is so bizzare it almost looks like a sabotage I can t believe manager would set them up like this
To make a point that the BBCJK can t all play
Exactly Its either a sabotage by Benitez so Perez stops interfering with tactics or its a sabotage by the players to get Benitez sacked Otherwise there s just no way any top team uses such a bad formation Even the most casual fan would notice something is terribly wrong
Bale Benzema Cristiano James Kroos
Aye
Did you hear about their line up in the game against Sevilla CDPRNMCKIBC
I find it hard to believe he did that s one strategy for taking the midfield battle out of the game s
That is some Moyes level failure right there
Surrendering the midfield from the start Bold move Let s see how it works for them Oh right Well then
Its perfect for Barca
This hurts to look at Still baffled how we went from an organized defensive team to that Sure its against the best team in the world right now but what a poor performance and utter lack of focus and organization Hope we can do better at the camp nou
Describing Madrid s formation
I can t understand how when real is attacking in possession Ronaldo Benzema and sometimes a third player are all within a radius of 4m of each other When on top of the above there is no one between the forwards and midfield defenders lines I am surprised they can still score as many goals as they do In fact they were already doing this last year with Ancelotti and Rafa just made it worse

Hmmm who s that new Hennessey player must be a new Wels oh
You can t give creative players that much space
You cant give Stoke that much space
Exactly That wouldn t fly even in lower divisions
I didn t watch the game but this is just a snapshot isn t it I cant see that the team remained in that shape all game Surely
A team should never stand like that against a top tier team
aahh the good ol charcoal formation
Shoutout to Hennessy for the graphic
If I recall correctly in the early chapters of Tsubasa their rivals did this strat and it was effective I dont know what went wrong there
It reminds me of how we would sometimes end up looking under Moyes
poor benitez he came to italy and totally forgot how to football
Ah the classic 4 2 4 wide formation with Kroos and Modric as CBs
James such a good midfielder though right
He is He was one of the few players that were somewhat carrying real
I mean Barca were going to dominate the midfield anyway In some ways it is a good idea to not waste players by trying to compete with them in there
Because they re good you decide to give them more space
Modric Kroos James
How long will barcelona fans drag this out
About as long as that gap in your midfield
bravo just bravo
Great keeper
Had probably his best performance for Barca yet
I refuse to take anything seriously a Liverpool supporter says
Yes because the fact that he supports a lesser team than yours means his opinion doesn t matter
Bet you have lots of friends

You just didI hope we will see a worthy clash between barca and bayern at their best
i don t think bayern will ever have robben and ribery on the pitch together again but those 2 being on the pitch might not even be their best team at this point
Costa is better than Ribery anyway
No he s not This is such a stupid thing to say
Not that I necessarily agree with him but Costa has been amazing
yeah but Robbery is a nightmare to play against
R bben is better
No Robbery is better because they steal points And in hindsight 49M total for that striking power is a steal too
of course he is He has been playing just as good as prime Ribery since he got to Bayern Current Ribery wouldn t get off the bench with Costa on his current form
just as good as prime Ribery What s it like having a memory span of one year
It proves that right now Costa appears to be the more productive choice Ribery has lost a step it happens to all players eventually
Ribery has lost a step Ribery was absolutely bonkers last season And no one knows if he lost a step because of his current injury He will return soon Maybe already in 3 weeks
The point I m debating was that as of yet Costa is not better than Ribery in his prime Perhaps better than Ribery now
Ribery has never had this much impact in his career
Had 7 assists and 5 goals in the small handful of matches he actually played last season Bundesliga specifically You have to be trolling
Cool random stats
Oh god please leave
that s my point everyone was pissed that bayern were missing ribery and robben against barca now it doesn t matter
Well Robben is important they are much more dangerous with him Ribery isn t
this would be amazing
There s not much between both teams just now Barca have been excellent for a few matches but Bayern have been consistently excellent At the same time it feels like Barcelona have done their homework and ironed out their early season problems The extra motivation might give Bayern the edge too after Barcelona beat them last year
and then there s the fucking almighty augsburg
EINE INSEL MIT ZWEI BERGEN MOTHERFUCKER
Verstehe ich nicht was meinst damit
It s a popular song from an old german kids theatre from Augsburg that was very popular in the TV and it s the goal song of the FC Augsburg We also don t give a wimpel before the game but a puppet from that theatre Lovely club that one
Been to the puppenkiste museum last year after going to the christmas market Had to rewatch Urmel aus dem Eis and Bill Bo after that
I went three years ago with my little brother my then still alive grandmother and my mother Damn that was a lovely day was so close to buy a fully fledged Jim the Lokf hrer puppet for 70 And the only time I have seen a professional footballer was Bobadilla a fewe weeks later getting drunk on the christmas market Good times I miss that city so much
Every time there s a discussion about Augsburg on this subreddit or r borussiadortmund I can count on you being there Why did you leave
Why did I leave what
Augsburg You talk about it so fondly that I m curious about what led to you moving away
I finished my bachelors the masters there was not for me and most people that made that place what it was for me left So I wanted to see how much I like other places Turns out that I wasn t imagening it when I thought that those four years where the best time I will ever have And I will always remember it fondly Maybe even move back there one day who knows Augsburg shouldn T go below second league though that s a requiremend
Jim Button and Lukas the Train Conductor to be precise
Wtf were we doing
Should ve never won that game to begin with
8 different formations

Everyone has to visit the dentist
And no one enjoys it Except for Augsburg
Well Augsburg did lose in the last minute so they might not have enjoyed it that much
The dentist was nice to them for the whole trip and then he just ripped out the tooth They were definitely in pain
We didn t enjoy the wrong penalty call But we enjoyed the match
I m with you on that Hate winning that way would ve rather taken a draw against The Parked Buss of Augsburg
Just wait until Mainz makes Bayern look like a bunch of amateurs yet again
Like they often do Fucking Mainz
I dont know much of the german league why other teams are not even close is about resources why is Bayern in a different league than the rest of the teams
Bayern right now would comfortably whoop every other league aside from La Liga They have a gulf of talent across world football not just their own league
Bayern are not all that much better than the top teams in spain england italy or psg ON THEIR DAY The thing is that bayern are so consistent comparatively They have been making far fewer mistakes than the other top teams in europe
Consistency is what seperates the best from the rest Arsenal can beat Bayern on their day and we do but we d get battered 4 times out of 6
Correct That it what i just said
And I m just pointing out why that makes them much better than the top teams in England Italy PSG
Fair enough i guess i just thought i portrayed that when i said ON THEIR DAY We agree then Consistency separates them Cheers
Yeah ressources Bayern can compete with the best because of ridiculously good marketing TV money is a joke compared to Spain or even England I would wager that Suarez Neymar and Messi make more money than all of Borussia Dortmund first eleven combined
There s not much TV money spread around the league but Bayern has done well to market to supporters globally that other teams haven t gotten close to Having an amazingly consistent success rate in recent years and having some of the most famous NT players certainly helps the appeal Bayern also has been incredible well managed and received consistent growth where other German clubs squandered their potential in the past Lastly once Bayern solidified their place in the top clubs worldwide the income was solidified as well causing further gap in the BL
Holy mother of fuck
Their home record in the CL is even more impressing
Pep likes his funky formations
And that s why I hope that if we meet Madrid or Barca in the CL before the final it will be a home game first as opposed to an away game
Why where there 24 more seats on the first 2 matches
Corporate boxes probably
Curious to see if they can keep it up when Europe s elite come visiting
Barcelona Arsenal Dortmund
When did they meet Barca this season And Arsenal and Dortmund aren t part of Europe s elite anymore
Hey now
Dortmund especially this season are better than most teams in the CL regardless it d be deluded to say otherwise
Might get far in the EL true
Oh whoops I thought I was on the post about our last 9 home CL games
Yeah Well to be honest neither is Ajax if Arsenal is not sorry I actually love Ajax
Ajax hasn t been part of the European elite for nearly 15 years now maybe longer Money talks
For me Ajax is not in European elite this season But they are usually I usually have high expectations from Ajax because I love Ajax very merry much
he s right they haven t been a mighty European side for a long time last time they got to QF of UCL is 2002 03
Yeah I know I still do not want to admit it

One team league

I think he meant that Bayern are so good that no other teams can match them But its the same circle jerk bullshit that people are taking shit about PSG and as a Celtic fan I hear it plenty too
Don t see what that has to do with his comment
one team league multiple leagues

Deutsch ist manchmal auch in Deutschland selbst eine schwere Sprache Immer weiter so
Aktuell schwer Wird sich aber auch bei mir wieder legen liegt wohl daran dass ich vor einigen Monaten selbst in Paris war und die Dinge die ich dort als sch n in Erinnerung habe jetzt einen dunklen Unterton bekommen Es ist nicht wirklich Angst im eigentlichen Sinne sondern viel mehr Wut und Trauer
Krass Find s halt brutal wie der Terror jetzt auch Deutschland erreicht Vor allem so wie du s erz hlst Ich hab mich aber auch brutalst mit dem Thema auseinander gesetzt Der Mensch f hlt sich halt zu dem was ihn ver ngstigt hingezogen Darum hab ich viel zu viel ber Paris gelesen und auch gesehen
Wie geht s euch eigentlich so nach den Paris Anschl gen und der Evakuierung in Hannover Habt ihr Angst Ehrlich gesagt w rde ich l gen wenn ich sagen w rde dass das alles bei mir nichts ausl st Versp re schon etwas Angst um da mal bei der Wahrheit zu bleiben Andererseits sollte man sich solidarisch und die Terroristen nicht gewinnen lassen aber das f llt mir aktuell schwer

Maybe try selecting a role for him in that position that s what I do So instead of CM Playing position select CM Central Midfielder That s what I do when I want to re train my player and it seems to help
He s still at United in 2018 in my save Getting decent amount of apps but not a key player United did buy Kane in their first season so they play him instead
Getting no yellows is pretty difficult thing to do Your players will make tactical fouls and or lose their head and make rash challenges It s pretty much impossible to not get carded at least once in a game
Can I see your squad I m currently playing with Gent and I m only in 2018 so I m still struggling a bit

Injuries suck so much
Grear read funny to see all of the coindicences
TIL
Season cut Shaw t Fucking excellent hahaShame he wasted his career winning everything with Barcelona he could have taken us to Championship glory
He would certainly have added strength to our sub s bench
Sure he d have got into a midfield of Nicky Bailey and Kevin Thompson
He never proved himself in the Champ but neither did Kev who was always injured Bailey was alright Robson was the real guy to displace
Always had a soft spot for Tarmo Kink Should ve kept him just for advertising Parmo s
Loved Kink remember him scoring a double against Burnley shortly after we got him very decent player
I fucking love it when Estonian players get praise
The Estonian Exocet What a left foot Shame he was so incredibly hit or miss
Mate he s the Tallin Torpedo Remember one match after he scored his first screamer for the club he came on in the last few minutes literally everyone in the stands was saying he would fire one in from range What did he go and do fire one in from range
Thomson is a quality player would have done a lot if not for horrible injuries
Spent his career at a team who couldn t even dream of winning the Football League Championship Shame indeed
Heres some quotes from the article that this article is referencing Xavi is a genuine football fanatic I interview players all the time You and Jamie Carragher are the biggest football addicts I have met I met Carragher on a beach in Ibiza when we were on holiday What did you talk about Football He s a good guy a fanatic You can see that He came back to Spain to interview me I bet I could ask you about lower level teams in Spain and you d know Ibiza from the second division Ibiza are now in the third Barakaldo a tiny Basque team with a beautiful stadium They re leader of one of the four Segunda B leagues Look shows his phone I read about all the leagues every day Alaves Near the top of the second Gaizka Toquero has got five goals so far Huesca Near the bottom of the second Regional fourth division club San Andreu Mid table Started well I have friends at these clubs I follow how they do Cornella who play next to Espanyol is another I follow the Belgian second division because there are players from the Aspire Academy there What about lower level English football I follow Middlesbrough because Aitor Karanka is there Brighton are top of their league I met a boy the other day English He was wearing a Barca shirt but I asked him who he supported He said Sheffield United I know them they have 20 000 fans in the third division That s incredible You get that in England I watched some of a game with Charlton the other day There was football on television yet the stadium was packed with supporters Incredible If that was in Catalonia Olot vs Reus then there were would be a few people there and the families of the players Heres a link to the full article
Xavi s wife must be so fed up with him
well actually When I have time I d love to do the same but I think my wife would kill me Can you imagine OK you stay with the baby for three days while I go and watch Liverpool against Everton
haha he said it because he talked about Luis Enrique before he became a trainer that he used to go and watch teams and he used to wear a scarf so he was not recognized
that sounds awesome wish i had the money to travel around europe watching all the best derbies out there
Didn t he break up with his previous girlfriend and basically say well at least I can finally watch all the football I want
Xavi didn t date anyone for a while in order to be free from distraction and focus on football
Xavi and Carra seem like such an unusual combination Hopefully they both find their way into management at some point
Imagine carra trying out a bit of Spanish with a scouse accent
Me yamo carra
Sounds good to me
I ve heard it It s not so bad The real odd one was a very strong Welsh accent combined with near fluent Spanish of the Spain variety It was quite odd To be fair both were better than Chileans haha
You re basically describing what Angel Rangel is going to be like at the end of his career
Joint managers of Catalunya
El Clasico 2035 Xavi in charge of Barca vs Carragher in charge of Madrid
So knowledgeable What a guy imagine he ends up coaching Middlesborough
i m not sure my heart could take the pride
Holy shit how does he have so much time to follow all these leagues amazing Can t wait to see him training Barca some day I hope Lucho stays until Xavi arrives
What else does he have to do Footbalers are usually free most if the day after they finish training
I mean I imagine that after a long day of doing nothing but playing thinking about football and fitness you might want to do something non football related Like go mushroom hunting
It sounds like he just looks at the tables and reads articles
Yes I watch a lot of football Madrid are very strong this season They have a different philosophy to Barca They work a lot on their defence Rafa Benitez has improved that snigger
What s the Aspire Academy
Qatari football factory Foreigners go in NT players come out
That s by far the best definition for it African and Asian players training to make it into the 2022 Qatari NT
Football academy in Qatar where Xavi is studying
Best football academy in Qatar IIRC
I m Mallorquin and I didnt even know Ibiza got relegated
What a legend I miss him so much
That is such an incredible interview I wish there would be more revealing interviews like this where we get to read about player s experience in historical events and their insights towards football in general and certain players in particular
Brighton are top of their league INCORRECT Clearly Xavi knows nothing about football
they Sheffield Utd have 20 000 fans in the third division That s incredible You get that in England I watched some of a game with Charlton the other day There was football on television yet the stadium was packed with supporters Incredible If that was in Catalonia Olot vs Reus then there were would be a few people there and the families of the players How can anybody say English football has no identity
huh who said that
Vicente Del Bosque
Totally out of context He wasn t talking about the fans at all He was talking about the English way of playing football vs the Italian Spanish insert any country here s way of playing football And he s right Those times when you could recognize the nationality of a team by the way they played is over Take Arsenal and Chelsea for instance Totally opposite ways of playing yet in the same league There s no English Spanish or Italian identity in terms of playing anymore or at least that identity is getting much more vague
Take Barcelona and Atleti and you have the same disparity in play style
Absolutely yes Which is precisely my point
Pretty sure he was talking about the style teams play with when he said that
In what context
He s a cretin
What a glory hunter
Dags and Red or nuffin m8
Xavi should come help us out so those 20k fan aren t pissed because we lose 4 2 at home to fucking Shrewsbury Town Fuck
Big Nigel s doing a fantastic job
Curse of the Nigels To be fair it can t just be him We ve got a massive squad full of crap bought for a lot of money Our entire behind the scenes finance board is very opaque so no one has any idea who s actually making the final decisions on stuff I m pretty depressed seeing you lot doing so well too Football s pretty shit right now
What s happening with McGahey
Sent on loan to Tranmere God knows why our whole defence is shit might as well give him a try
What about Che Adams and Louis Reed Your squad is full of young talent sorry if I m kind of rubbing it in at the moment
Adams got injured and is finding his feet again Reed was one of the offenders last night got subbed at half time Both are really talented though Reed seems to have become a bit too relied upon for my liking though it s a fair bit of pressure for him especially when the others in midfield aren t playing well
Xavi s just trying to get in the next Sean Bean movie
LORD OF THE GRASS
Not surprised to hear him say this always thought he had his head screwed on right
He would have been dead proud of United s fans last night singing your not fit to wear the shirt 40 minutes in
The Lane s not the happiest at the moment
I can understand why you would have been promoted by now if you kept Danny Wilson
I was behind Wilson got some unnecessary stick off the fans C est la vie
Will be even more impressive next season when we re drawing 20k in the fourth division
The more I read about Xavi the more I like him He seems like such a nice guy
He is a genuine football fanatic follows third division teams all over the world I can t wait until he coaches his first team I think it s inevitable that he will become a coach
let s hope so his football brain is immense
Which is crazy to think how smart Lahm must be then Pep worked with both and made a huge point how smart Lahm was
Let s hope he successfully managed a first division team
Obviously I hope he coaches Barca one day
Mhm I m just nervous cause sometimes highly successful ex players turned managers due fairly poorly
He seems nice a good leader but from what I ve seen he also seems like a sore loser
Ferguson always scouted for the sorest of sore losers they were the ones that fought the hardest on the field
you re really determined not to find fault in Xavi lol
heh not really I m just trying to point out that for many football players their biggest asset is that they are sore losers
Except even among the realm of top class footballers Xavi is noticed as being a sore loser So it cant be that
So is Mourinho So is Ronaldo Are you saying this because of the grass length comments he d make
Not that nice a guy https www reddit com r soccer comments 3bfwxk xavi qatar has conditions for great world cup
I m just saying if someone gave me millions I too would blindly praise them for everything
yeah but you probably aren t already a multi millionair
But they can get good infrastructure due to money
Really He s said and done a lot of things recently to put me off him
really s top lad
What a football nerrrrrrd one of us
I m sure he writes for Zonal Marking under a pseudonym
Why is Xavi such a cool guy
Xavi is the ultimate hipster
Would he be impressed by this blavdes fan https twitter com Oddschanger status 669531006769213441
Xavi is a fantastic player and genuine football fanatic but I must say the whole Qatar ambassador thing is very disappointing and on the same note Barcelona s Qatar Airways deal is quite depressing as well
Have to think that Juninho and Ravenelli had something to do with that
Great Another what Xavi said post
Too much Xavi last days
Xavi to Middlesbrough confirmed
Mate he wouldn t make it into our midfield
Who needs Xavi with Big Grant bossing it
Banned for Huddersfield though isn t he I suppose we can arrange a tryout deal for this Xavi guy
Oh no you ll really struggle to beat us now s
Poor man s Adam Clayton
Fuck it we ll have him

I d go as far as say that even Arbeloa would be a better replacement for Carvajal if the latter can t play for some reason than Danilo Porto are laughing their asses of for robbing Madrid 30M

Kovacic himself said he s much better as a DM than as a offensiv midfielder higher up on the field Don t really think he ll be a success in the game

Wake me up the day Cristiano do the same for BaleHe s back guys He didn t rapidly decline die or some other shit He s okay
He didn t want to score till Messi started scoring
I miss Messi its not fair if hes out injured and I keep scoring Ill just lay low for a bit until he s back
The Kneejerk is real
He was briefly less than superhuman but even that was scary enough for him to get back to form
He obviously did decline but since the last game found the fountain of youth He s getting better so must have reversed the ageing process it s the only explanation I mean that maybe a few bad games happens to everyone and just because you re over 29 doesn t mean a few bad games means the end of your career
I still think he s declining

That has been opta thing from the get go
They usually use words that actually have relevance to what the stat is about But motivated seems like it was just randomly chosen
Not really in the news today it was reported he d promised to work harder etc in the team meeting after the Clasico so obviously they are going with the idea that Real are extra motivated for today s game after Saturday s embarrassment
Only Benzema Ozil and Di Maria have assisted Cristiano more than Bale
OptaJose 2015 11 25 20 38 UTC 21 Gareth Bale has assisted in Cristiano s 21 goals only three players did it more times Benzema 31 zil 27 and Di Mar a 22 Duet This message was created by a bot Contact creator Source code
Reports of his demise have been greatly exaggerated
Mate this is against a team in a war torn country He has dissappeared in all the big games this year Atletico Sevilla PSG Barca
what the hell does war torn have to do with it You realize that the game today was played in Lviv a city on the complete opposite end of the country from where the conflict is taking place right Ukraine is a very big country It s not like they had to worry about bombs being dropped on the stadium It s amazing how far people go to discredit Ronaldo s achievements
Or maybe how the players are affected by the war You think it s a coincidence how many Brazilians are leaving the team They re afaird for a reason you know They had to fucking move stadiums and the club s owners are running out of cash to support the teams
It didnt affect them in the Ukrainian league they have only dropped something like 2 points since August
That s becasue the whole league was affected by the war

I think you are being ignorant and unfair towards Shakhtar They are extremely strong at home and its incredibly difficult to beat them Many big teams in last few years have been unable to do that And we saw that today how good they can be
saw today how good they can be What you mean go down by 4 goals Conceeding 3 goals in 10 minutes is much more indictative about how bad Madrid s defense is rather than how good Shakhtar is Especially considering the fact that Madrid have conceeded 10 goals in their last 3 games
Doesn t change the fact that shakhtar are good at home
so did the team don t pin it on one player
He s not pinning it on one player Ronaldo played shit in all of those games not talking about the rest of the team
Ronaldo played shit but so did Bale Kroos Ramos Benzema etc are they all fastly declining too
No because you don t usually decline as a 26 27 year old top level player Ronaldo is nearly 31 and when he plays bad he essentially isn t there
what does age have to do with it if anything it s his knee problem that has limited his dribbling compared to the past but Ronaldo didn t go from scoring 66 goals and getting 22 assists last season to becoming useless this season in the space of 3 months even when he is playing like shit he can still give chances for teammates and create space for others with his movement just because he isn t dribbling past multiple players it doesn t mean he isn t doing anything useful the only problem this season has been that he is isolated as striker and his finishing has been bad also factor that his teammates have been invisible in most big matches too
Age has a lot to do with it come on I know that Ronaldo is a crazy fit guy but sooner rather than later later his physicality will decline Also 61 goals and 21 assists Also Declining being useless ffs It means he s not playing to his standards He s been realtively worse even in his worse form than he was before
yes in 2 or 3 years he will no longer be RM quality but as of now he is definitely good enough to make a difference in any match as long as everyone around him doesn t disappear like against Sevilla and Barca I get what you re trying to say though but it came across as you calling him useless in the original comment by saying essentially isn t there
15 goals in 17 games this season while having a short run of his worst form in years Not to mention the entire team has been playing like crap and there have been an endless amount of injuries Must be tough to life up to your peoples standards
How many games has he scored in And name the teams Ronaldo plays well when the whole team plays well and sometimes he plays bad when the team aren t up to it
15 goals in 17 games is still a record 99 of players want to have at the top level
I m not pinning it on anybody
He has dissappeared in all the big games You re making it sound like his team is playing great but he s letting them down or some shit
I mentioned Ronaldo because the guy I was replying to talked about Ronaldo
they are actually in some damn good form if you actually take into consideration their form but hey fuck that
deleted
I think i understand that part doesn t change the fact that they re playing very good
the boy is growing up
Eh Wrong I think I seem to remember him getting 2 assists away at Schalke in 2014
In the 6 1 win no Cristiano had 2 goals and 1 assist Bale 2 goals and 1 assist Benzema 2 goals and 2 assists and Ramos one assist

I hope we do renew his contract Best destroyer in the world
does he even play that much
He s still a starter although he doesn t play midfield under Pep
He did yesterday I hope it becomes more routine It probably will considering Boateng Benatia and Badstuber are all healthy
It will I think a lot of the stuff the fans see Pep also sees It s why I like him He knows what needs to be done and he does it He s smart about it though He doesn t rush into things He wants to make sure that the players are all healthy before he makes moves again He moved Lahm to RB and he ll move Martinez to CDM again Martinez is regaining confidence though When he first came back he was definitely not ready to play in the midfield He looked afraid to dribble He ll get there though
Typically Bayern managers have fallen into two archetypes pragmatic and not idealistic idealistic and not pragmatic Not to say I don t appreciate them but Klinsmann and Van Gaal fell into the former while Rehhaggel Trappatoni Hitzfeld fell into the latter In his last stint Heynckes was the first manager in a long time to maintain a sense of style whilst tweaking the philosophy to achieve the best results The more you look at Heynckes career as a player and a manager the more remarkable it becomes and I ve never even been a zealous admirer of him He went from stubborn Osram to a man who adapted and changed at an old age That kind of transformation is seen rarely in anyone especially not one as decorated as him And I think Pep has really taken cues from that Yes Guardiola is highly intelligent and he wants to win more than anything But let s be real here he s always been an idealist and it s hard to imagine him ever abandoning a possession system and playing like stoke But it s year 3 and he is still constantly modifying his starting XI and tactics because a for rotation and b because he knows that the best results have not been achieved yet and he ll keep searching for the best tactic for his team I hope he signs that fucking contract or imma kill him
Well that took a dark turn at the end
How s Badstuber doing these days
He just got back from injury got subbed in against Stuttgart two weeks ago Was in the starting XI against Olympiacos yesterday and got a red card Not really a justified red card in my opinion but I m biased so you gotta decide for yourself
Just got back from injury
Didn t get to watch the second half how d he look in midfield
Couldn t really tell the match wasn t hard at all so he got to coast pretty much
He s no2 CB with Boateng And plays over Benatia
Benatia and him rotate although he s recently been starting more often over him probably due to form injury issues I guess you can say they re kinda joint starters it s just that neither of them is clear cut above the other Kinda like MaTS and Bravo at Barca except Javi and Benatia aren t exclusively alternated between the league and the cup
And Badstuber is still injured Who will move on first
Badstuber played yesterday Not the entire game though since he got a red after an hour
since he got a red after an hour I like to call that one a substitution with a handicap to even the playing field
Ya to be honest though it was a fitness problem with Badstuber He wasn t as fast as he should have been and the guy went down and he got sent off
Badstuber was never fast
it s just that neither of them is clear cut above the other I d say Martinez is easily a cut above Benatia which doesnt come as a surprise because the latter didn t have much chance to play with the team for a longer period without injuries
It s hard to say Bayern haven t had four fit CBs for more than a handful of games under Pep and its usually closer to two Between Benatia Badstuber and Martinez it s usually a safe bet that 1 2 of them are injured at any given time At the start of this season all three were actually injured and Boateng played the entire defense himself and in one game was subbed out leaving just Xabi to cover the entire back line The most you can say is that Boateng is a permanent fixture His partner or two depending on whether it s a 3 or 4 man backline varies a lot He could be paired with any of the three other CBs or even Alaba and Rafinha who sometimes play as makeshift CBs too Pep is all about that flexibility
They have to keep him he was insanely good when they won the CL Just needs to stay healthy for a while
If they could start him in the midfield that would be greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
Yeah I would so love to see a midfield of Martinez Vidal Thiago
Pep please
more like Thagio please
Bist du besoffen Deine komplette comment history schaut so aus als ob ein 14 j hriger dies alles geschrieben h tte
Der ist leider immer so
I can t even imagine the conniption Athletic fans have whenever they pop on a Bayern CL match to check in on Javi and he s chilling in his own half with Boateng
chilling in his own half with Boateng Dude have you seen our matches lately The only one chilling in our half is Neuer and even that just barely
that vocabulary tho
Is conniption not like a word people use
I mean my friends think I have a huge vocabulary and it s not something I ve ever uttered I meant it as a compliment haha Edit unless you re being sarcastic and I missed it
It s a common enough word in Ireland it means hissy fit
Also common in West Virginia Irish immigrants maybe
Chilling in the centre circle you mean CB have to stay in the other half under Pep or no chocolate
Javi was among the main reasons why we won the CL His presence in midfield was nothing short of staggering It was as if there were three of him Edit Yes please
He has to get back in midfield Simple as that
I love you Javi
Come to Arsenal please
Every thread yada yada
It s cool just throw me a downvote
You can t have all the playmakers and cdms in world gooners
not having any dms is one of the main things that s been fucking them the last few years tbf
He would be a dream signingGeorge Best top 10 goals according to some dude on youtube

The change of pace is amazing Also your flair is amazing
Thank you
Pat Jennings save at the start as well Us Northern Irelander s should have done more with those two surely
Worse teams have won more with worse players See Denmark 92 and Greece 04
Some of the tackles flying in are brutal
Goal number 10 was nuts Half of the players today would still be rolling if that had happened them
So many long balls

Obligatory George Best quotes If you d given me the choice of going out and beating four men and smashing a goal in from thirty yards against Liverpool or going to bed with Miss World it would have been a difficult choice Luckily I had both I spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered I used to go missing a lot Miss Canada Miss United Kingdom Miss World In 1969 I gave up women and alcohol it was the worst 20 minutes of my life On the pizza gate incident between Manchester United and Arsenal That s what children do throw food That s not fighting We were real men We d have chinned them On having blood transfusion after a liver transplant I was in for 10 hours and had 40 pints beating my previous record by 20 minutes I used to dream about taking the ball round the keeper stopping it on the line and then getting on my hands and knees and heading it into the net When I scored against Benfica in the 1968 European Cup final I nearly did it I left the keeper for dead but then I chickened out I might have given the boss a heart attack On Eric Cantona I d give all the Champagne I ve ever drunk to be playing alongside him in a big European match at Old Trafford On Cristiano Ronaldo There have been a few players described as the new George Best over the years but this is the first time it s been a compliment to me And my favourite now They ll forget all the rubbish when I ve gone and they ll remember the football If only one person thinks I m the best player in the world that s good enough for me
And of course George Best was the greatest player in the world Pele
The Pele comparison one anyone remembers In which he would say somewhere along the lines of if he is not that beautiful then he would have achieved more than Pele
This one I think If I had been born ugly you would have never heard of Pel
Yeah look like this But I don t think this is the exact wordings
Is that Ronaldo one true He could only have seen Ronaldo in his first couple of years at United way before he looked like he d become a truly world class player
There are some videos of Ronaldo s first couple of seasons 2014 Ronaldo could be as effective as 2004 Ronaldo with 1 3 of the trickery but you never knew exactly what 2004 Ronaldo would do Edit At least once he d finished his stepovers
I had the once in a lifetime chance to play against George Best and some other UK footballers in 1976 I lived in Torrance California and played youth football since 1966 at the local parks and then in the AYSO I went to High School with Sigi Schmid and Marine Cano ex goalkeeper for TB Rowdies and in 1976 I was at El Camino College in Torrance using the weight room facilities on a Saturday morning in February I was in training for a shot at a berth in the 76 Olympics but in another sport when a friend sees me and knowing I played soccer came into the weight room and told me there was a pick up game on the football practice field and they were looking for more players I was going to decline but then he told me that Rod Stewart was there so off I headed It wasn t just Rod Stewart but also Elton John and and some other expats playing with some other English expats and a good part of the LA Aztec team Pre Season was just around the corner and everybody was trying get the poundage off But I was young and really really fit and was outrunning every body most of the English players I think that year the Aztecs has like a 20 23 man roster and 17 of them were from the UK I hadn t played any organized soccer in 3 years and just kicked around with friends over a year ago but as soon as the rust fell off and I got my feet from under me I started playing better good enough to be asked to come back as a practice player Many NASL teams had unsigned player they had practice with I has to sign some kind of waiver but in turn they paid for a medical insurance policy for me and all training players I played for about 4 5 weekends and a few weekdays before I had to leave for more specialty training in my own sport I remember after I left Terry Fisher the coach of the Aztecs asked about me When I came back from the overseas later that year I was told the Georgie had opened a bar called Besties in Hermosa Beach by the pier on Hermosa Ave When I walked in he was BEHIND the bar LOL but he even remembered me called me a gddam idjet mucker and gave me a pint George was his best customer and he would often take a stack of bar business cards walk down to the beach and pier and hand them out to every good looking bird in a bikini for a free drink and he never cared if they were legal age or not If they were pretty they deserved at least a beer NONE of these girls knew who he was but about 3 out of four a took up the offer and the bar was always filled with birds and also bird watcher who ended up buying a lot of drinks that kept the bar afloat He had an apartment on the beach about a block away George never drove especially in the US but always had someone drive home As drunk as he sometimes got he was usually at every practice on time He really loved football and a hangover was no excuse One of my most prized possessions was an old photo I had taken with me and my girlfriend with Rod Stewart Elton John and George Best I never made the Olympic Team but I did graduate from college and went on to work in Washington DC for an agency that is called now The National Geo Spatial Intelligence Agency and when I moved back to DC I found out my soon to be ex girlfriend had poached that picture along with two T shirts we got from a Battle of the Bands at Redondo Beach Veterans Park of a band we played against called Mammoth as the pimply faced lead guitarist gave to us because he thought my girlfriend was hot Mammoth may not ring a bell but I m sure the name they took later Van Halen would But even though the Tshirts and photos were lost the memories will never be and they sound even better when you talk about your Glory Days But I ll never forget George Best that g ddam idjet mucker for the rest of my days

Hahahaha yeah
Well there s a mural of him over on Sandy Row You could call over in your hoops jersey and lay a wreath if you fancied it There was another one out East somewhere but that was painted over to be replaced by a paramilitary one which understandably kicked up a fuss
I well i know about the mural but you think you d have heard something today about it being the 10th anniversary
Im more surprised its only been 10 years Feels so long ago I think they still have a mural up the Cregagh near his childhood house
It s very strange seeing someone reddit referencing the Cregagh
It seems like weeks ago to me
I actually served him drinks in 88 while working at a club opposite Granada Studios He was making the show Best Marsh The Perfect Match and Tony Wilson brought them in for lunch
RIP George
Greatest player to come out of Ireland Most naturally gifted United player You can t teach or learn what Best could do
Isn t it funny how all the most shining eulogies in British football are reserved for players who burnt out early and became complete pissheads Best Le Tiss Gazza etc
I admit Le Tiss had his fair share of McDonalds but i ve never known of any allegation of Alcoholism on his part And maybe a bit bias but he had a pretty average length career retired at 33 due to injury Not exactly the hardest worker but putting him in that category seems a tad harsh
Judging by his Countdown appearances last month Le Tiss is doing fine and is a much smarter guy than anyone would have suspected
He was never an alcoholic but he used to get hammered most Saturday nights during his playing career I live in Southampton and every landlord club owner and taxi driver has got a story about Le Tiss on the piss
Just realized I don t know a term for drinking that rhymes with Le God
Moore Charlton Shearer Beckham BTW Le Tissier played regularly until he was 34
Also not British but from Ireland Paul McGrath can be added to that list Premier League PFA player of the year as a defender I don t think any other defender has managed that
McGrath is actually about as British as it gets He s from Ealing
I ll drink to that
It s funny because he died due to his crippling alcoholism
Yep his problem was so bad that he drank through 2 livers
from what I hear hard to stick to recovery when fans were willing to buy him drinks
In his autobiography the one published before he got his liver transplant Blessed I think it was he said that he tried some hypnotherapy style treatment which he claimed worked for several weeks for him Then when the press found out he was going to it he stopped going because he didn t want people hounding him when he went
Very similar to Paul Gascoigne
Don t die like me Reading Best s story kind of ended up helping me get something of a grip on my own crippling alcoholism Learning of his tragic decline from something mercurial and almost otherwordly to something like a useless tramp bumming around in strange leagues and causing scenes It motherfucking wants you dead or down and out and it doesn t give a shit about how fast smart or successful you are The end phases of death by alcoholism sounds so utterly demeaning disgusting and painful that the actual end sounds like a massive blessing
Fuck man Glad to hear you re doing well
And the tenth anniversary and one day since 24 hour drinking laws passed in the UK
Going on up to the spirit in the sky It s where I m gonna go when I die when I die and they lay me to rest I m gonna go on the piss with Georgie Best
Conversely the man was also an alcoholic wife beating scumbag who took multiple liver transplants that could have went to more deserving people Disgusted this city named our Airport after him too We have many more deserving people in our history Edit Kicking a ball around should not absolve a person from their sins irrespective if you support that club so downvote away Edit 2 United fans down voting as expected
yeah even Utd fans tend to ignore his later days with the club I remember watching a documentary which mentioned that in his last season with Utd he got so fed up with the team s performances that he went AWOL in the middle of the season and decided he d rather party than show up to matches Can you imagine if a famous modern footballer did that
What is Carlos Tevez
Shuck it Trebek
I ll take Football Traitors for 300 Alex
Didn t City ask allow him to take the leave though
for 6 months
Disgusted this city named our Airport after him too We have many more deserving people in our history He was a product of his times and had his demons Fair play he had a dark side but who else was any better The Eamonn Holmes city airport
CS Lewis John Stewart Bell Jocelyn Brunell Gary Moore
Wait so kicking a ball has less merit than playing a guitar
I see you opted not to pick the author or respected scientists Nice
Gary Moore
A man has never defined the Blues more aptly
Agreed I m no fan of the classic blues King Allman Clapton but there was something intense about Moore s style something unique
Equally we shouldnt forget him and denigrate his achievements because he wasnt a very nice man Alcohol addiction isnt something you can control the wife beating is obviously scummy but abusing people for being addicts seems a little harsh I didnt realise an airport was named after him I assume Belfast not Turin
Yeah Belfast
What s it with greatest footballers beating their women Messi will turn alright though i think
It s just stupid people from bad backgrounds who suddenly get the world handed to them on a platter and can t deal with it well
More acceptable back then
Correlates with substance abuse and addiction problems
If Messi started on his wife she could just put him back on his high chair
Even if Messi does get started with the whole domestic violence jag he s probably too small to do much damage no
Kicking a ball around Grow up will you There are few things more cringey than someone saying football is kicking a ball around as if it s that simple You re no better than these people on Facebook demanding that footballers swap their wages with soldiers As for Best s alcoholism and liver transplants that was his personal life This post is celebrating the footballer
You re no better than these people on Facebook demanding that footballers swap their wages with soldiers I love these its brilliant to see people trying to work out the economics of it and realising how fucking stupid it is
One brings joy and entertainment to the masses The other invades foreign nations on the whim of politicians FWIW I m not having a go at soldiers We all need to make a living but we can all stretch the logic to suit our arguments
It s fucking bullshit Its like my mother or my wife when united lose a big match It s just a game For better or worse people invest a huge part of themselves to this game Look at the faces of the fans when their team scores a an important goal What else brings that much extreme mixture of positive emotions fleeting as it might be Very fucking little
It s just a game must be the stupidest quote ever To them it may just be a game but the fans it means everything people often say men show no emotion but you look in the crowd after a team has been relegated won a cup and you ll see many emotions including grown men in tears
It s the same with any Maradona post But he beat his wife but but he s a cocaine addict but he he cheated by using drugs
With a friend currently on the transplant list who has barely drank a pint in his life fuck this guy not only do people like him take organs that other people deserve more high profile cases like his actually discourages people from signing up to be a donor
high profile cases like his actually discourages people from signing up to be a donor Is that true I just can t imagine people refusing to be donors because of cases of famous people being privileged
I d be amazed if this is the case
Not what I meant in the slightest an alcoholic who is famous meaning people who might have previously signed up to be an organ donor wouldn t do so one of the main reasons people use to not sign up is because they feel that there organs would go to alcoholics and drug addicts
Some might say alcoholics and drug addicts are victims of horrible crippling illnesses too
Seen children who had no choice in the slightest become ill and rely on donations to live hard to feel sympathy for somebody who bragged about the champagne lifestyle he had and caused other people to be discouraged from signing up to be donors because they don t want there organs going to alcoholics and drug addicts For what it s worth I think there is a vast difference between someone who homeless or has suffered abuse and has turned to substance than a rich and famous footballer
So a rich and famous footballer deserves no sympathy for being blighted by a horrible condition I m not one to pick and choose who I feel bad for The man died from this He s not sitting in some mansion somewhere lording it over his stockpile of livers And I agree he s no more deserving of a liver than someone else Perhaps less so because his illness wasn t just something that could be fixed with a new liver But if you were dying and were offered a liver would you really turn it down for someone more deserving You re a bigger man than me if you would
Hang on are you saying he should have turned it down Blame the system dont blame the guy for taking something available to him that could save his life
He got himself into that situation by drinking to excess and bragging about it whenever he could
I can t believe people are circlejerking his LOL I DRANK ALL DAH ALCHAHOL quotes from him after he had one of his fifty six liver transplants It s fucking pathetic Sure he s a good footballer but he sounds like he was an absolute tosspot
Whats worse was the actual real life circle jerk People in Belfast knew he was an alcoholic it was literally killing him yet they where busting their asses to buy the man a pint just so they could say they drunk with their hero Pathetic
Pretty much exactly the same happened with Alex Higgins Probably Gazza too
You can t fault them They re Irish
Yeah if he was Australian we d probably just take a photo with him outside the local prison
That was nice
They d probably classify themselves as either Irish or more than likely Northern Irish
The man was a first class prick I m glad his hedonistic lifestyle ended as it did but the repercussions can be felt on his family
ITT folk who ve been lucky enough never to have had to deal with addiction in their lives Talk is cheap lads
I think it s where you see the average age of the subreddit coming out Haven t had to deal with their own shit or haven t lost anybody to anything like alcoholism or drug addiction Ill people aren t arseholes they re ill
Bunch of absolute cunts Seemingly think that alcoholism is just loving the drink no self control Best was just a party animal Its being dependent on alcohol every second of every day And if one more person equates him going through two livers to stopping two people having transplants I ll swing for them The first liver was his fucking own he wasnt giving that away
I ll swing for them https pbs twimg com media CHFE EvWwAA2rpH jpg
Yeah addiction is a problem and it s hard to stop doing something you re addicted to But when you burn through 2 livers because you can t stop you re taking chances away from other people People who might ve lived a longer and more decent life Talk is cheap mate Just because he was good on the pitch doesn t mean he should be worshipped off it
One of the livers was his own tbf What is your solution Let him die Its not like it was a conscious decision to kill himself after the transplant he was an addict
I don t know if I have a solution But he shouldn t have been bragging about slugging pints while on medicine
If I had to choose between dribbling past 5 players and scoring from 40 yards at Anfield or shagging Miss World it d be a hard choice Thankfully I ve done both George Best
Proper legend
This thread should be a quote fest
Dumb cunt didn t deserve liver transplants he got Because of him many people who actually deserved 2nd chances didn t get them
Helmet
He s right though
Alcohol addiction doesn t make him a dumb cunt though
Alcoholism is the only disease you can get yelled at for having
Just an Asshole
He s a prick for other reasons but being unable to control his alcoholism isn t one of them
Its like they think that people make conscious decisions to become addicts
Yeah don t think Besty really thought oh I ve just gone through a whole load of pain and been bedridden for months while slowly bringing myself closer and closer to death but I might just do it all over again just for a laugh Could be another one of those stories people tell about my banter
Not for alcoholism For the multiple liver transplant which could be used by other non scum people
And the liver transplants were brought on by his inability to control his addiction Not sure what point you re making
The point is that people who consistently relapse into alcohol abuse shouldn t receive transplants over other patients and should be pushed down lower in the waiting lists
No shit Poirot My point is that doesn t make Best an asshole He didn t relapse on purpose
To be even considered for a liver transplant a patient has to be fully responsible to keep it healthy It is pretty much like 2nd chance When they screen for possible candidates that is an extremely important category without it people don t get livers He got them because of his status and pissed it away An addict got a healthy liver over someone who actually was sick
Hmm I m starting to think he might have had some kind of addiction to the alcohol Almost as if he had no control of his drinking We should probably tell the authorites For now let s just call it alcoholism until they come up with a better name for it
He got them because of his status and pissed it away And died People are acting like Best got away with one His addictions killed him We should be pitiying him not abusing him Its these attitudes and misunderstandings of addiction that mean we dont treat them properly
So if he got the liver because of who he was and not because he was considered responsible enough to be sensible with alcohol post transplant why does that make him an asshole Surely it d be the people who made the decision My point doesn t change if that s the argument
If you re drinking is so bad that you need many livers it s probably time to go Also being in addiction doesn t desolve you from criticism There s nothing wrong with drinking and driving then it s just addiction
Haha what an incredible leap
Well 2 people didn t get second chances not sure how he d have stopped many people lol

Horrible analogy Proper analogy would be like if someone is fat because he has horrible eating habits and gets a heart replacement over someone who actually had a genetic heart condition and needed a heart Then proceeds to ruin his healthy heart by eating shitty food while a person with a heart condition dies from the wait
Rest in Peace Best but he wasted two Liver
My uncle Harry was his minder for a few years Says one morning they woke up in Glasgow had a match at Old Trafford that day Made it back to Manchester in time for the second half Scored a hat trick
I spent a lot of money on booze birds and fast cars The rest I just squandered
Can t believe it s been 10 years I remember watching the funeral and looking over at my Dad as silent tears rolled down his face
oh
14 min compilation https www youtube com watch v 2FhhhT27KM0
Nice there was some clips I had never seen before
Yeah it s a good compilation I reckon I even like the music I remembered this clip after searching for some clips of him a while back to see how great he was and this clip thoroughly convinced me
10 years already I remember watching his funeral on the TV Shame he practically retired at 25 due to drinking and partying
If only he had a tiny bit of professionalism he could have gone on to be a Man Utd legend like Wayne Rooney
The famously professional Wayne Rooney Would you say the same about Tony Adams
If Tony Adams had missed training to go and get pissed or if he retired because he didn t get his own way and threw a hissy fit about leaving the club then yes Just so happens he didn t do any of that but that arrogant cunt Best did
Must have missed a fair bit of training when he was in jail for two months having been convicted of drunk driving Alcoholism is a disease why does Adams get a pass where Best does not
Because Adams as a former Arsenal player is infallible apparently
Adams as a former Arsenal player didn t ruin two livers through being a pisshead cunt and didn t run away from training numerous times to aid that It s a case of someone who turned their life around and one nasty bastard who refused to
He did however drive drunk and admitted to playing games for Arsenal while pissed So he was a danger to others and put his career at risk Its a case of someone who turned their life around and someone who couldnt Do you think all addicts are just selfish
George Best drunk himself through multiple livers and into his deathbed Tony Adams beat his addiction and set up the sporting chance clinic to help fellow athletes beat their addictions
Continuing to drink after his liver transplant was stupid but it cost him his life Do you think he was doing it for a laugh because he just loved a party Alcoholism is a disease Adams should be lauded for beating it but Best shouldnt be abused for succumbing To criticise Best for allowing his alcoholism to affect his career and not Adams who missed months of a season and even played drunk is hypocritical
Stay classy buddy
Stay classy buddy How is he not being classy What the fuck does classy even mean in this sense You spoke ill of a footballer I like ergo you are not classy Typical vote pandering neckbeard babble
Maybe criticising someone in a thread about the anniversary of their death isn t a terribly nice thing to do
It s 100 serious I don t understand why Man Utd fans fall over themselves to laud Best who never wanted to play for them and missed training all the time to go get pissed yet slander a club legend like Rooney if he goes a couple of games without scoring
who never wanted to play for them You re speaking out of your arse Also no one s slandering Rooney He s their second highest goal scorer From what I can tell they merely want him benched
He has a point though Play to your best your entire career win countless accolades retire late on like Rooney and Lampard and you will be hated mercilessly mocked and ridiculed Burn out retire early and drink yourself half to death and the nation will love you for it We have a weird self loathing complex in English football where we hate the successful but eulogise the people who wasted their careers and talent
Yeah Lineker Shilton Shearer Beckham Scholes Neville etc are all hated Lets not pretend Rooney doesnt get a lot of warranted stick He s unprofessional he spends his summers drinking and smoking and he s twice threatened to walk out on United in order to get himself a bigger pay packet He s also not performed for England at a tournament in 10 years including letting us down badly in 2006 He s clearly been a fantastic player but that doesnt mean we have to love him

They sold their best players while offering new expansive contracts to average players and they built a new expansive stadium who is not profitable
Pique would have done the calma calma then the siiiiiiii celebration and then he would have spent the last minutes with his right hand opened to show the manita
CamaradonaEverything is back to normal in r soccer now
Setanta commentator they ve been well almost perfect while Messi s been away And now they re em they re just perfect
Still no Pogba screamers
Not enough degaard updates either
And Diego Costa antics shaming
He just got someone sent off I don t think it will be long
Well there it is
Chelsea are winning games now though
It s truly miraculous how game in this situation is plural
Tis a Christmas miracle
Was Messi actually injured Jesus
Took time off to gather more Ki
Yeah he ran out of sensu beans earlier
He gave them to Suarez and Neymar actually He didn t need them
He s been doing intense meditation sessions with the Elder Kai and is now Mystic Messi
Spent a couple of episodes charging up his spirit bomb
Just took time off to become Super Messi God Super Messi
more Ki Seung yueng
He s going to for a Spirit bomb isn t he
Those three are just insane Mezmerizing
Messimerizing
Yeah something like that D
Messimaruazing
Messuaneymarising
That s actually one of the best team goals I ve ever seen
How do you even defend that Three players just absolutely tearing through the whole team
foul
lucas would have brought somebody down
Except he would have already been on a yellow and would have had to let him go
Classic
two fouls
People can t just go flying through the air like that Jackie
You don t That s when you shake your head and say Too good
You just can t They re doing this against Roma but they could do it to any side
They can only do it when the opposing team doesn t defend properly If they do track the runners you can stop moves like that Problem is they do it to you all game and eventually you have a lapse in concentration and they do this to you
Just takes one player s lapse in concentration for that breakdown The fact that Barca does this so frequently is what s scary
was thinking that I suppose the backline has to push up with impeccable timing but with passing that quick it s not gonna happen In fairness to Roma they look like they were trying not to sit too deep but that frontline is just too good
Foul hard enough to sit someone down on the build up
At the start of the clip Keita is man marking him After Messi lays the ball of he follows it when he didn t need to If he stays with him he can block his run Even after Keita lost him it was still stoppable When Messi lays the ball of the second time Maicon doesn t react to his run If he reacted earlier he would have easily dealt with the ball It s great play by Barca and they caused the mistakes but the goal was avoidable from Roma s perspective
If Keita had stayed with Messi then Neymar would ve passed to Suarez instead From there Suarez would have the ball with plenty of space Neymar and Messi to look up to and maybe even made a similar sort of run himself there s just endless possibilities so score when you ve got a team playing as good as Barca have been playing
track the runners instead of chasing the ball The RCB has didn t track the run of messi leading to the goal
The RB and CB tried he was just too quick for them
Football porn
It s reminiscent of Arsenal s goal vs Norwich Aka this one https www youtube com watch v wz EaTwqNII
Why the fuck did someone feel the need to play Coldplay over this
Apparently either Norwich or Arsenal used to rule the world
Just not as good as Arsenal s I might be biased
Biased but correct tbqh
staight from the most biased source of them all thanks
Nah that Norwich goal was beautiful
No definitely not as good but similar for sure
God I love soccer
That was better than porn imo
You can t just pay a young lady with big tits to deliver goals like this in the champions league
That s what you think
Maybe we should try
We do have the technology now
Like something straight out of a video game
I wish I could do that in Fifa
And that finish Pure art
Seriously how the fuck do you stop that Unreal
chop him down
MSN is finally back
You know what s unfair this is not even surprising anymore Those three are an exhibition
Seriously Watched this goal and was like oh wow that was nice but was upset that the ball was played over the top to Messi instead of a backheel I just want the buildup to go on forever because I know once he s through its over
Good guy Alves
Didn t pull a Nani
That still irritates me
Some say it still keeps Ronaldo up at night
That explains why he keeps moving further and further away from Ronaldo
That will always irritate me Nani ruined what would have been the greatest goal of Ronaldo s life Ronaldo beats both the greatest defender in the world at the time Pique then the greatest keeper of all time Casillas against who was the greatest team in the world at the time Spain All those things together and Nani invalidates the goal with his greed Infuriating To this day I think it was the greatest piece of football I ve ever seen of course enhanced by the fact that he beat both Pique and Casilllas I don t care how impressive a clip is if it s in the Ukranian league EDIT To everybody telling me Nani was onside I don t know if it was true I still see a lot of debate till today Ronaldo still argues that Nani was onside Here is the best screenshot I could get from a low fps clip you be the decider https gyazo com 6c13739c5292aab0594f73b8c685092f Ronaldo always seemed to be a good sport about it but onside or offside that ball was going over the line and I don t see why Nani couldn t shy away like Alves did to give his teammate his deserved goal
But it was a friendly Ronaldo should have done that in the weeks before when he was playing spain in the world cup
Does anybody have a clip of this
https youtu be j5gDJfFvObg
idk soccer what happened
The ball would have gone in the net and been a goal for Ronaldo but because Nani headed the ball in while being offsides there was no goal Edit got called offsides
We followed the guy Ronaldo completly outplay the defense of the opposing team and scoring a goal or so he thought At the last moment one of his teammates hits the ball but he s so far up he s off side thus cancelling the goal Ronaldo gets mad rightfully so i d say
Here you go
Nani was onside though no 3 I think Pique plays him on with his legs because he s lying down and even so Nani touched it after it passed the line
STUPID NANI CANCEL CRISTIANO RONALDO AMAZING GOAL NEW 2015
GONE SEXUAL
he was behind messi when he shot he ball he actually impeded the defenders clearance by being in front of him Woulda been called offside had he actually been offside
He is in ultra teamplayer mode today
Isn t he always
He is he rather passes the ball than score himself
Great restraint and he held off that last defender
Hahah it s just really bad defending right guys They can t really be that good Right Guys sobs
I instantly turned into arab football commentator what a beauty

The passing the movement the Messi Perfection on a football pitch
Some fine Messi ing by Barcelona so far tonight
This is some performance Suicidally naive high press by Roma but Barcelona s passing and pressure is just beautiful Nigh unplayable
We ve made Messi a verb Pack it up boys

aside from the possible risk of epilepsy good gif
You re looking for the word seizure Epilepsy is a disorder that usually includes symptoms like seizures

Oh my
I regret nothing
He s Back
Let s face it at this moment Barca is just at a totally different level The set up of that goal is crazy and the finish Well its a Messi finish what else can be said
The assist for the goal was totally flithy I think that was from Suarez Such a deft touch
What a goal These guys are playing at an insane level nowadays
Holy shit
tiki taka level MSN
reminds me of Austrias team goal vs Liechtenstein this year http gfycat com GoodnaturedDistinctItalianbrownbear

Incredible goal my god
That was insanely good
Oh my what the fuck MSN That was honestly magical
Falque thought about appealing for offside for a second before deciding fuck it
Shit is not even fair jesus
Suarez can do anything
You know at this point you should really just foul them Maicon grab his shirt and pull him the fuck down So you ll get a yellow big deal But I guess it doesn t matter in the end because they gonna score some more anyway
He s baaaack
I love how people used to worry about how selfish Suarez and Neymar would play with Messi on the same pitch Jumped off my couch for this one

R ben Vezo Red Card Hulk SkillsIs a player considered a one club man if he was loaned out early in his career
If Andros Townsend spends the rest of his career at tottenham it would be funny if he gets considered as a one club man after like 10 loans
No need to exaggerate only 9 loans
Yes Lahm was loaned to Stuttgart back in his early days if I recall correctly and he s still considered a one club man i m sure there are other examples it s just that I can t think of anyone else from the top of my head
John Terry also was loaned out but noone would really argue he isn t a one club man eitherGood man Had a season ticket at Cracovia when I studied out there Some season we re having Great to see Kapustka doing so well too
Lived in Hyde Park Burley Roundhay and Swarcliffe Never had a problem in any of them
Can the dog die May sound weird but me purchasing the game is highly dependant on this I don t want to let him down
Leeds have more points than that
There s a club on Elland Road just off Lowfields Road who could do with some new players at the moment Owner is a bit of a knob mind Could probably get a game
Just a normal Leeds fan he was active on a Leeds message board once upon a time Tackle was clean and just done for a laugh that s how Vinnie was
Bremner or even his Leeds team mate Norman Bites yer legs Hunter Aggressive players who sure could play
So wrong

Can someone tell me exactly what these things are I need to accept I can t grow a beard I m also guessing you wouldn t recommend buying a cheap razor from eBay
Don t give a fuck about off the line clearances ten men etc It s an away win And with how we ve been playing I ll take it
Silvestri terrible for the goal which is a shame as his handling looked markedly better today Berardi positive on the ball but some mistakes such as passing Bamba erratic Cooper meh Taylor handled his winger well and got in behind once Dallas meh Adeyemi woeful Murphy positive on the ball dwelled a bit at times though Cook far too good for this team Wood did he win a header Antenucci hard worker always looks like he ll make something happen We need something different hopefully Botaka is it
I m just not sure why it takes us so bloody long to get going Dallas is great but only in the second half I d start Antenucci on the right over Byram He might say he doesn t want to but I don t think a player should dictate his terms to the manager He s a right footed player who is clearly comfortable cutting inside and shifting it onto his left He can definitely do a job there I d also like to see Murphy start over Mowatt
No worries I can see Inter having a good season Strengthened well and Juve s poor start will be a great motivator
