Every time there is a balance patch I get nervous and almost every time I am happy with how blizzard handled it So glad they didn t do the spore nerf
Thank the lord I m not even a zerg player but I feel like the current spore is needed because of the lack of a good anti air solution from zerg and that hasn t changed since HOTS
In reality the nerf only impacts ZvZ but I am also glad it didn t go through DH showed a lot of variety in the ZvZ meta I thought
Mutas absolutely still have a place as a viable opener because ravagers can t actually hit well micro d mutalisks If spores were nerfed we d just have the old ZvZ meta which was muta vs muta slapfests It was fun to play for a while but when all the ZvZs were the exact same ling bane muta it gets a bit boring to play
Agreed
I play Z and I absolutely hate mutas I would have died if the spore was nerfed
Because Zerg had good anti air options in WoL D
The interesting thing here is how much this reminds me of BW Remember how if one of the zerg players went hydra lurker vs muta ling the korean commentators would go oh this matchup is pretty much over Here in LotV I have no idea what the outcome of such a confrontation would look like but the interesting issue remains alike and that is the hydras cannot be everywhere and meanwhile the mutas are darting in and out harassing anywhere and everywhere they can be
Mutad are already very viable in ZvZ don t know why they even tested it Happy it did not go through
Ya I love the feedback and the listening to the community It s way better than it was in WoL or HotS
hi bot
Wow that was fast And I m glad they re ditching the spore crawler change after we saw some great ZvZ muta presence this past weekend
That was pretty quick
Probably wanted to give pros a heads up so the ones going to IEM Taipei had a chance to adjust
and winter regional qualifiers
True though those are already going on
The ones that are ongoing only have like 1 2 matches left anyways I think
When will the patch go live on regular ranked ladder
They said the 28th in the Community Feedback
Well they promised that the patch was rolling out on the 28th in the last community update There would have been hell to pay if they failed to roll out a patch on or before then
I m a little worried about PvZ it s really tough to hold Zerg all ins But we ll see I guess it might just mean we have to play differently
Pretty much it boils down to the same opener I ve decided where you build 4 phoenix to stop muta and then non stop build immortals and upgrades until you get to the lategame
Dont immortals get wrecked by hydra What kind of supply you aiming at before transitioning Zerg here so not familiar
Depends If you scout roach hydra then you start producing heavy on ground army If you scout air you mass more phoenix before transitioning I usually tech to storm archon either way so my comp can fight almost anything including an ultra transition Pretty much you gotta see if the zerg is going to base all in or try to play a macro game with you
Awesome cheers So I assume you open single stargate phx and robo after third depending on what you scout Also what would your ratios of phx void zealot adept archon templar immortal disruptor be against a zerg who seems to be going roach hydra but isn t clearly committing to a big allin e g more relevant in the lower leagues they re building an army and taking bases and could decide to allin pressure at any moment Finally if you playing 2v2s against a Z T team how would the composition change assuming zerg is roach etc t is bio Thanks in advance for sorry for the question spam I m decent as Zerg diamond but got NFI how to play Protoss coherently short of mass sky or random yolo troll styles
Double stargate usually but thats considering you get phoenix harass in I ve been opting for a couple of adepts early on for base protection and securing fast thirds Adept harass can really help you gauge how strong they are and their composition Honestly if you can buy time mass voidray and carrier is really strong It takes 3 bases though and if they all in you have to micro your early void oracle really well They key to beating ravager all ins though is lots of immortal production You could just assume the opener is 2 star 2 robo twilight temp tech tech The build I was following was from a progame I can t recall who He opened double star and then stalker
Thanks again How would you get upgrades on 2 3 base with this Also how many gateways you aiming for on 2 or 3 base to support this
I add gates depending on my composition More gates for heavier ground army Keep adding gates when you get into the lategame for better remax Usually try to grab 3 attack and some air upgrades for lategame The 3 ground is so when you remax after a big fight you can make a ton of archons and your ground army will be very tough This is strictly PvZ though
Perfect thanks
Ultras are terrible units vs chargelot archon immortal The real problem is trying to kill a defensive Z before broodlords get out because pushing into good defensive lurkers is really hard which is good otherwise Z just straight up dies to chargelot archon immortal before broodlords
But hydra get wrecked super hard by storm and disruptors one of which you should have before the hydra numbers get out of control
wow you may not be able to triple expand riskless
as a bronzie i think i should shut up about this
If Trump can run fro president you can damn sure shout Bronzie opinions from the fucking rooftop Go for it young Terran
I THINK ADEPT SHOULD GET MORE DAMAGEEEEE I will leave now
pvz is going to be frustrating
PvZ is already frustrating
True
I hope the next step is toning down Ravager Bile I d love to see what a casting range decrease would do and PvZ could be in a good spot
I think a damage reduction vs buildings would be a nice change especially in a ZvP
I don t care about ravagers lurkers is a pain in the ass I think it should be Hive tech
Thing is in tournaments there s not a lot of games where lurkers look un manageable disruptors shit on them Making ravagers slightly less strong against protoss could have a snowball effect that makes everything that come after more manageable anyways which often happens when tinkering with early game units
I guess that sounds reasonable
Then every zerg would die to a 3 base charge archon immortal protoss push in every game It is litterally the only thing that allows zerg to survive to hive
And they re fucking awesome I switched to zerg in LotV for 2 reasons it s the only race I haven t hit masters with and lurkers are badass as fuck If they take away lurkers I have to go back to being an all in protoss or a whiny terran C
You should seriously try phoenix into chargelot archon immortal It shits on Lurkers especially if the Zerg is attacking with them Phoenix can lift up Lurkers and archons immortals destroy them as well I face this all the time in KR and it s strong Stalker disruptor not very good versus it imo
Might as well make it a melee ability then Damage nerf is be better I think
Current range is 9 that s huge There s room for toning it down without making it short
Can you shorten the bile range without making the Ravagers a useless counter to well placed Liberator harass
That s an issue yes ravagers are needed to defend against liberators but when the roles are reversed and the ravagers attack they just shit on libs and tanks
So long as ravagers are the only viable counter to liberators until T3 then they absolutely cannot be nerfed in any way
They can t do this because of liberator range ie bunny s build The only way for zerg to deal with liberator range is ravager bile or air units It s poor design for liberators to force a zerg to go air tech when that is not their tech path of choice
Vs ranged liberator cheese openings that can t be scouted no range 9 is fine
I always thought the bile CD would be the best way to tone down the ravager You keep the ability to defend against libs and you can still kill them with the same number of biles when they harrass but they re more manageable later on
That makes a lot of sense actually would like to see them try something like this
I personally think a small casting delay on Bile would be nice
The longass delay before damage isn t enough
Yeah these nerf ravager posts are completely moronic There is literally zero pro players complaining about Ravagers They are simply not a problem I guess I could throw up a Terran flair and start whining about tank nerfs or something too
They can t do this because of liberator range ie bunny s build
Make it less stackable If you can t oneshot Pylons now the PO nerf won t matter that much for defending allins In big fights you mostly spread them out anyway
I love the comments Terrans complaining that their race is broken and weak protoss saying that this nerf will kill them zergs saying that the PB nerf will make them die to air so in a nutshell every race is UP and OP at the same time
Schroedinger s Race
Brilliant
So nothing new
The thing is all of these things are kind of true Terran have been suffering from a pure balance standpoint Their win rates are low in both matchups and PvT is downright frustrating for them All the changes in this patch should give them some more room to do their thing which is good Protoss have been relying on heavy Photon Overcharge usage to counter the strength of Zerg all ins and general economic harass And heavy Adept pressure to limit the army advantage of Terran in the mid game I see it as taking away stilts from the 5 6 guy in a basketball game Sure the stilts were unfair but now he s a fucking 5 6 guy in a basketball game Zerg still struggles with air compositions even with the power of PB which could outright cause other players to not use air in their compositions In the end all of these changes are GOOD changes because they were little bits of too much making up for other flaws But now we get to see the other flaws and hopefully it ll all shake out for the best
Only one of these races has data support for the UP position
Not at the same time At different times or rather at different stages of a game Against different matchups
Damn Well I guess we don t need the TvZ ZvP TvP show matches if this is going live If Blizzard is still looking at potentially adding the spore change I have Snute and TLO willing to do a ZvZ show match this week I ll keep ya ll posted
I don t know possible it is but it d be great if you could get it out before patch probably not possible im assuming it hits tomorrow morning during maintenance A lot of people are iffy on the spore change
I d still be interested in the PvT and PvZ to see how the changes have affected those matchups
Can blizzard please acknowledge the Disruptor aggro bug Are they even aware of it
Pretty sure they re aware but it s under not game breaking well get to it eventually
PvZ be prepared for the return of the Skytoss
Did carriers get buffed Don t they still take 90 years to make Bomb really never did much to carriers
No buff to carriers still too long of a build time and still not viable in most circumstances
I have been experimenting with going carriers in every game so far I can get to high M with em but it s really difficult
Shouldn t you bomb the interceptors
You cannot cast parasitic bomb on the interceptors themselves anymore if that is what you meant
Ah it was too strong I m guessing
same reason why BCs are not used
I doubt skytoss will return
Should just release on the 26th for everywhere except Korea where they can release it on the 28th like planned due to matches
It really is a drastic change Playing with mutas vs the nerfed spores was amazing since you could actually harass with a reasonable amount of mutas Defending it was pretty difficult Mass queen seemed to do well but I feel that leaves you open to mass expanding or passive transitions I don t think it s the right change when mutas are as strong as they are now I also don t like that the spore hard counters them as hard as they do but it seems necessary
Really excited for the viper change I still enjoy a heavy muta style and or late game 40 muta switches 60 dmg parasitic bombs means you need more than 2 bombs ticking on each muta every tick in order to kill any one of them Before it was only 1 1 2 bombs making a 2 parasitic bomb hit nearly impossible to prevent muta s death By the time you pull out the 2 mutas they all still die haha Now if I pull back after 2 bombs go off they ll all live if 3 I ll still may have time to keep the rest majority of my flock alive Also can t wait to basetrade protoss again Nothing more frustrating than having an 150 supply army lose to 8 Pylon Overcharges and a warp in Looking forward to the patch
Or your scouting overlord dying to a pylon and that being a good use of energy
depending on the timing and what toss scouts out of the zerg still a good use of energy
I played a ZvZ where I was behind in muta vs muta but managed to sneak out 4 vipers with PB I was more mineral starved than gas starved I guess I figured out afterwards that ended up being about 2 3 vipers more than I actually needed to turn the tide in my favor Since the damage stacks it creates crazy overkill potential If you force a muta vs muta fight and can land PBs then even if they split they are probably taking mutas out of the fight and cause a favorable engagement for the person without PB even if they are significantly behind in mutas I think that s why the even though the damage change is heavy it is still going to be a really powerful spell you still need to split and that even perfectly splitting takes away a lot of your advantage at least for mutas which don t have a lot of range For the majority of players who probably can t split well enough anyway it will at least tone down how ridiculously fast it can melt an airball
Should be a good iteration of the game I m interested in seeing how tvz and tvp develop after this and the potential liberator nerf that might be needed
That s not how it works 1 less damage from the Adept is a really REALLY big deal because it passes the Marine HP breakpoint Saying build 1 more Adept and it s the same is completely wrong because this statement assumes your Adepts put out a concentrated stream of DPS ignoring break points and overkill Currently a Marine without combat shields has 45 HP and an Adept does 23 damage per shot In two shots the Adept kills the marine 46 dmg to 45 hp After the patch an Adept does 22 damage per shot Two shots only does 44 damage leaving the marine with 1 HP This is a BIG DEAL it requires a whole extra shot to kill the Marine If we are considering a pure Adept army vs a pure Marine army the Adepts just got 50 less effective they take 1 5x as much time to kill the marines as they used to So the DPS of the Adept might only have gone down a tiny bit but because it passes the Marine HP breakpoint it s a huge effect
Don t forget it also needs 3 shots for an scv now
ya i think its appropriate though not everything should hit like a DT
Also keep in mind upgrades With 1 attack the adepts will be as powerful as they are now However none of the current adept early pressures have 1 So this is basically an early game adept nerf that will deal with warp prism or regular gateway pressure plays Those plays will still be good in the mid game once you have 1 but it should be easier to defend for T because you won t have to lose SCVs earlier
That s what im saying I quoted the first comment from the battle net forums
Also stim now hurts more than it helps for marine vs adept until you have combat shields
Yeah because units deal big chunks of other units HP in damage this is why slight HP buffs are such a big deal Even if the health gained or in this case damage lost is not much compared to the previous number the amount of shots required to kill the unit on the other hand makes a big difference This is why CS is such a big deal For instance lets say you re fighting Banshees A banshee needs two shots to kill a marine but three to kill a marine with combat shield Despite gaining slightly more than 20 more HP the marine is 50 more resilient in this case so it s almost equivalent to the marine getting 50 more health for all intents and purposes Roaches are another exemple the take 3 shots to kill a marine or 4 with CS so it s a 33 survival increase Hell DT are probably the most extreme case they take two shots rather than one shot meaning marines have a doubled effective health So in the end it really isn t about how much the numbers have changed but about their practical effect in a combat scenario That 1 damage difference effectively makes marines 50 tougher in the early game where the adept is problematic but it has a negligible effect in late game confrontations where the adept is fine
and it was all about the SCV s I really hope that Protoss still is able to trade cost efficent with a terran without the need to rush tec Terrans will always have the mobility let us have the efficiency
The time of us having cost efficency just ended Back to needing to rush tech or timings
In mid late game they will still need 3 shots to kill shield marines anyway This nerf mostly affects early game
Actually it still makes a difference with shields since right now adepts will 2 shot marines with shields if they stim It only stops mattering after 1 if the Terran does not have better upgrades
To be more specific 1 damage will allow Adepts to 2 shot Marines unless they have 2 armor this scenario should never happen unless a Forge was sniped while upgrading 2 damage will always 2 shot stimmed no shield Marines regardless of upgrades
After the change 1 damage on Adept does not allow them to 2 shot a Marine with 1 armor The only way an Adept returns to its 2 shot status is if Toss is ahead on upgrades If they re even the Marine takes 3 shots Edit Wait I think I m wrong Adepts get 2 damage against light for each upgrade Disregard
Yeah adept damage will be 10 12 and upgrades will stay 1 1 Darn tricksy protosses
The change only really affects Adepts until they have 1 attack at which point they will be able to 2 shot the same things they do now It s an early game change only But just like saying just get 1 more adept saying just get 1 attack is missing the point of why this is a huge change as you say Early adept attacks are currently strong because they can do things with ONLY 2 adepts and WITHOUT a forge
From what I ve read in analysis this effect disappears the moment protoss researches 1 ground weapons Even if terran researches 1 armor Both for marines and scvs So this is mostly to curb down adept all ins including the prism all in as it would require 1 to reach the same effect and thus be delayed and map control to some extent
I m just going to add in that this change only affects the adept marine relationship before any upgrades except adept attack speed Once adept get 1 attack upgrades they ll two shot marines Once marines get shields they will die in 3 shots both pre and post patch
Yeah Adept can get 1 attack but Terran can get 1 armor As for shields marines will still die in 3 shots but if they ve been stimmed they STILL take 3 shots to kill previously only took 2 Gotta consider all the upgrades coming into play Edit I think I m wrong Adepts get 2 damage vs light with each upgrade Bummer for Terrans
It takes 2 armor to negate 1 I belive
i wonder if adding an oracle to adept pushes will be effective now It deals a constant stream of damage with its beam so potentially it can quickly kill off all the 1 hp marines scvs left after 2 shots from the adept
You ll have to add a stargate to the push which either means you re pushing with fewer adepts or later into a stronger defense and an opponent who hasn t faced as much pressure
In the mid game not much is altered A marine with combat shields needs 3 adept shots to kill Pre nerf and post nerf adepts will always take 3 shots to kill a combat shielded marine so mid game interaction is left mostly untouched They didn t nerf adept attack speed so 50 attack speed adepts will still do great against combat shielded marines in a straight on engagement It just won t be as one sided since marines after a stim back down to 45 health won t be easy prey The power of recent PvT builds also hinges on forgoing upgrades for more gateway units or faster tech since adepts do not benefit greatly from 1 attack Now getting an upgrade lead on a terran allows protoss to two shot workers a huge advantage considering how effective adept harass has shown itself to be
Exciting When does this fo live
You guys are sick Keep it up
Good to see that DK came to his senses and threw out the proposed spore crawler nerf Keep it up
I wish they d have tested adjusting the adept more I m still not convinced the damage was the problem In my opinion the mobility and vision of the shade was the problem
So Thor change and siege tank change from the table Raven
Not really up to date with sc2 Isn t this a pretty good thing
I hope the patch goes live today I have no motivation to play with the current outdated game
Has the mod been updated to this
Thank fuck they didnt include the spore nerf I wasn t looking forward to pure muta vs muta especially the whoever rushes muta the fastest wins kind Rest looks good though
protoss is gonna get shat all over in tvp The matchup was broken on both sides but blizz only fixed one Liberator ghost armies are untouchable
If thats the case it will be patched too Also liberator ghost is probably one of the most expensive things I can think of for terran
I m not talking pure liberator ghost I just mean 4 10 liberators and 3 ghosts with a bio ball This is a composition you can comfortably get off of 3 bases and if the protoss does not have tempests they hardly ever can win a fight
Liberators in general are so frustrating for protoss in the lower leagues If you don t have air units ready good luck being able to shoot them with stalkers By the time you get void ray phoenix they get shut down with marines
Everything is frustrating for lower leagues
You re right It s a brutal frustrating game but that s why I like it Starcraft is not for casuals Things like muta switches or endless bio drops are understandably frustrating but nothing makes me rage like having a liberator sitting behind your mineral line out of pylon range when the only AA you have are a few stalkers that can t reach it without getting obliterated
Nah man flying my factory in their base building Mines and then killing all his workers is not
GG PvZ This is a disgrace
Im toss and i really like this changes from a design point of view The only thing that i dislike is that it forced us to double stargate pretty hard And i hope we can do somethign about that in the future
Man i am scared i am a protoss player and i always have trouble with speedlings until i learned to proper position my pylons and use PO but now that we have half of charges i think zerg can abuse it pretty easily with his unit mobility
Did you play Protoss in WoL A mistake in building placement or unit hold position was an auto loss Man I switched to terran at the wrong time
Has the patch been relased yet
Glad they don t plan to implement the spore change I hope they look at tanks next TvT is killing me So this patch comes out on thursday
damn I can already taste protoss tears welling up
Don t worry we ll be downvoted to oblivion by anti protoss bias until we get more nerfs We re near 40 in ZvP and this pylon overcharge nerf is going to make Roach Ravager pushes insanely stronger Pylons are so easy to snipe with corrosive bile and now that it costs 50 energy we re super fucked I hope you like the taste
i still think it s blizzard s fault for coming up with attacking pylons they are stuck with it and so they are desperately trying to make it viable
That is the story of Protoss in Starcraft 2 Forcefield and MsC have been band aids for poor design
Protoss is definitely the worst race design There has always been the massive problem of defenders advantage with protoss because the game is balanced around warp in mechanics Terran has longest range units and sim city for their defense and zerg has creep and queens Protoss always just had to make due with whatever quick fix blizzard gave them forcefield and msc
I completly agree about the original sin about the defender advantage But since LotV where the warpgate has been finally strongly nerfed you could have strong gateway units again like in BW I m dreaming of a world where pylon overcharge and force field disappears completly as they are bad design And they could buff gateway units gets as a tradeoff That was not possible because of warpgate before but now they can do it
They did buff gateway units Look what happened
They didn t buff any of the existing gateway units They added a gateway unit that is really strong with the buffed warp prism They buffed a midgame zealot upgrade That s it Stalkers still suck Zealots are still weak early Sentries take all of your gas and are useless because of the buffed shooting pylon
I agree with everything you said My point is that the adept buffed gateway centric play and now they are scaling it back a bit
Gateway centric aggressive play Adept gateway still sucks shit at defending early vs roaches or marauders without overcharge
would you trade your MC for a shield battery just curious
I honestly think that instead of PO Pylons should grant a bonus to either shield armor and or shield recharge while a protoss unit stands in their power field I mean zerg has home field advantage with creep terran can set up really good simcity defenses but PO allows defense with basically no units shouldn t defense imply actually having units to defend
sim city can be used by all races though zerg use evo chambers to funnel hellions and toss wall off the natural for fast expo that being said im not against the PO changing to buff units as it still means toss has to scout and have actual freaking units rdy to defend
P and T simcity are for two different things T simcity is to allow seigetank liberator to poke from max range P simcity is only about controlling zerglings and new in LOTV maximizing pylon surface area at the front
First time I ve seen that suggested but it s really good idea actually Get rid of photon overcharge and give pylons an automatic shield recharge ability to units and buildings in its radius Encourages the protoss to build units to defend rather than just rely on cheap abilities
Even if you did that Protoss would get shit on by early all ins To make the pylon shield recharge ability viable early game it would be broken mid and late game
If it was strong enough then sure It would have to be comparable strength to like bunkers which are insanely strong due to repair and low commitment due to salvage
That s debatable since pylons also give supply If you need PO to activate this hypothetical buff then sure but if it s passive it might be stacking up to 5 or so but not too strong
The people who downvote only due to race are idiots Anyways the problem wasn t pylons when an attack comes to the front door with ravagers it s that protosses can sit in their base with the MSC and be perfectly safe from any counter harass A zerg run by usually only consists of 10 20 lings or 5 or so roaches which get murdered by pylon overcharge A 5 zealot run by requires 6 8 roaches to deal with proper micro Obviously some races should excel at things better than others but permanent overcharge safety wasn t fun and offered little to punish protoss for moving out Unfortunately while this nerf helps with that like you mentioned it s going to make the actual pushes harder to defend and the only thing I can think of is to change bile to 50 damage vs buildings
What I am worried about is how this will affect early liberator strategies that often depended on photon overcharge to defend it unless you just went stargate first Liberators tuck themselves in a corner so they only target 2 mineral patches but that is enough to make it very hard for stalkers to defend it on some maps
Or maybe use the great insight you mentioned All defense should require unit control of some kind Currently the all purpose PO can be used defensively or offensively because of the way the MSC works This unit was put in the game to give protoss some early game poking potential against zerg by privaledge of recall Poke a bit do some dmg or threaten to do so then recall back and turtle It was pretty elegant but still not enough Then overcharge debuted and essentially filled that niche twice Now that the WP and adept have stepped into the meta it is aparent that protoss can have some potency without recall but still requires PO Its a bit of a shame that the WPadept meta couldnt develop more and somehow seek some balance But the reality is that it in combination with PO limits terran far too effectively to stay unchanged I welcome the nerf and hope that it allows terran and toss to have more than 1 strat in this MU The question remains though can toss defend against zerg w o PO I don t think they can unless their offense becomes their defense I think that PO being nerfed gives toss the window to show blizzard how we can utilize the race defensively without need of the spell with units and strong micro but simultaneously dread the thought of more losses vs the very potent rorava timings I would like to see in the future of protoss PO removed from the game entirely the zealot and the stalker to recieve an early game utility buff to compensate and for stasis trap to become a more interesting keystone in how protoss pull off defense I sort of wish the sentry took a stronger role as a defensive unit also That at home it had some fortifying ability that helps preemptively defend against drops Such as the sentry can recall a unit to its location Spell is channeled and cancelled with dmg Being in a power grid makes it cost half the energy per unit Maybe scale the energy cost per unit type 1 4 energy for gateway units 3 4 for a robo unit So effectively 5 6 sentries could recall a majority of protoss army Units being recalled are vulnerable and immobile At least then toss has the ability to push and defend with units that need micro and cost money and a spell that needs foresight Moreover multiple sentries at each base gives the protoss the flexibility to fortify all 3 bases or just 1 base depending on the kind of drop instead of slugging an MSC to the drop sight then following the inevitable carnage It also requires good scouting which IMO should be the best and most reliable way to subdue incoming harassment Lastly offensive sentries could be used to refortify an army after a succesful defense but would lose all of their energy in doing so which makes them effectively dead weight in a fight
Yeah they get murdered by pylon overcharge but that s because the protoss army is slow as balls and won t be able to home and defend in any realistic timeframe While the zerg has a queens a creep network and fast units the protoss only has warp in which got nerfed And since gateway units are kinda shitty it makes perfect sense that protoss needs a bit more help dealing with harass
That pylon overcharge buys plenty of time for the protoss to get back to the base especially when the MSC has full energy
Yes that s my argument Pylon overcharge is necessary to buy time
its sad but true with corrosive bile hitting buildings this is gonna be a pain to hold
Yep it feels like Stargate will be the go to opener in pvz That s assuming it s not a 1 base Roach ravager rush which I m not sure how strong that will be if at all
Still won t be as much as T whines with a positive winrate
not sure how T can whine any more since adepts are nerfed how adepts destroyed bio was the biggest problem but now it s over T is very strong now
Wait one week
optimist I see
T never stops whining Even when T has a 70 winrate in TvP and TvZ then T whines that they play too much TvT
8 armor Ultras are still sick against Terran
yeah but so are liberators against mutas all races need some OP shit
I m barely seeing anyone acknowledge the adept change I m assuming that s because terran will still need something to complain a out after they lose
Warp prisms will be the next gripe
They took their time but I think these are the balance changes that most people wanted
regarding the overcharge 15 seconds 1 25 attacks per second 12 attacks each attack is 30 damage so 12x30 360 total damage its 360 damage for 25 energy or 360 25 14 4 damage per energy for the new version just copy the numbers except 20 seconds and 1 25 becomes 1 to get 600 50 12 damage per energy by the numbers that means its nerfed in damage but not very much 2 damage per energy and its not as spammable that makes this far more strategic since now you can t spam 7 overcharges and defend a large roach attack with a handful of adepts lets see the roach pushes boys edit of course this doesnt reflect on being able to run and hold out the overcharge which is now less spammable this change could be big but its good now you cant 3 base and tech up so easily
Well 3 base and tech up easily got us up to around 40 in PvZ Now let s the where that goes
I think the most important note is that pylons are easily snipeable with ravagers I predict PvZ being even more zerg favored in the near future
It s Likely it will be for the first month 6 weeks but i think this is a very good step towards balancing if this nerf proves to be to much they can look into buffs elsewhere to hopefully bring Protoss back into line that said i am pretty sure what we are gonna see is a meta shift into more unit based defensive builds with a msc for back up as opposed to the reverse which is exactly where we are atm especially now that this change opens toss up to more harassment through drops banshees muta and the like which imo is a good thing for everyone
Yeah this is basically certain
We need a way to buff pvz without affecting pvt
I don t think the Spore change and the viper change should be put in around the same time As much as I like playing muta styles I say let s see how the meta is after the Viper nerf before we decide to re nerf the spore
there s no need to nerf the spore it s already weak the biggest advantage of the muta style is the mobility even with todays spores you need quite a lot of them otherwise they will just be focused down pb nerf is ok imo
Can someone please explain the difference between duration and weapon period I m unsure what the difference is between the two
Duration is how long the overcharge is active on the pylon Weapon period is how much time is between each attack
Weapon period would make more sense being called attack delay
Ohhh ok interesting Thank you

Whatever happened to the proposed change to reduce or remove the Disruptor shot s bonus shield damage
They seem pretty sensible changes adepts don t two shot scvs photon overcharge can t wipe a whole army and parasitic bomb isn t quite so crazy

Still could be better than some maps of the current map pool
I wish I could disagree with you
Where are players supposed to walk There is way too much liquid
It s a solid idea We ve never really seen a big flat expanse with nothing in it being used in a map Of course this map also has a gigantic open area between bases which makes it ridiculously zerg favored But if the steppe leads nowhere then it doesn t cause balance issues It could be connected to the map by two or three chokepoints So fill the space where TLO s face is with standard map geometry and you ve got something interesting Here s a quick sketch of the concept An otherwise normal map but where there would be a think sneaky map edge passage is now a giant field
Oh please let this map get published played put on ladder
Wont be much worse than some of the ladder maps
I haven t published it yet because I m uncertain if it goes against the EULA
How It s not offensive in ANY way

Greatest map of all time
That s beautiful
This is better than 3 maps on the current map pool I m not being sarcastic edit The bases at the top remind me of broodwar maps where they have the alleyways on the side
this guy thinks TLO is overrated and he still loves it That basically confirms it s amazing
I d like to bust some banelings all over that face

Pro tip Nipplegeysers
We ve yet to see this come across our desks
Skins via achievements Now we re talking
Now we just need skins that depend on your current in game average APM Like the lasers your units shoot change color from Blue at low APM to Red at 100 200 APM to RAINBOW colors at 200 apm Or your marines with this skin will have black wigs on At 150 APM the wigs turn blond supersaiyan at 200 they get longer and glow At 300 the marines get a flame effect turning super saiyan level 4
This is one of the most insane suggestions for SC2 I ve ever heard and that says a LOT
Losira will be sitting with his own color
Someone make this an extension mod
This idea is crazy and awesome at the same time but I think APM based is impossible to make What about using the unit rank corporal veteran etc etc So cool btw
Yes we re talking
I would love for someone to copy paste this article so I can read it at work I want to know what we are talking about
Here you go A new Tal darim skin has been added for the Colossus To unlock this skin players must complete the achievement Winner Is Coming in the Achievements Multiplayer Competitive category To see this skin appear in games set your expansion level to Legacy of the Void in Options Gameplay Expansion Level The icon art on the command card has been updated for the following abilities and upgrades Zerg units Burrow Raven Explosive Shrapnel Shells Medivac High Capacity Fuel Tanks Banshee Hyperflight Rotors Reaper KD8 Charge Adept Resonating Glaives
Now what is the achievement winner is coming
Win two games in the same multiplayer mode
Wow that s rough Why make the skin if nobody is going to be able to unlock it
Well I know that was sarcasm but really I thought the achievement for a skin would have been well you know harder
It s actually quite a letdown Literally everybody you see in multiplayer as long as they ve played a couple games will have it unlocked Skins lose their meaning if they re not rare or hard to get
Thank you
good shit go sHit thats some good shit right th ere right there if i do a so my sel i say so thats what im talking about right there right there chorus mMMMM O0 OO O Oooo Good shit
Honestly I think it is great Even though it s probably there until second part of the year when they start adding way more things in the game as they said who will be more unique skins But basically it s saying that we ll get skins multiples ways and also multiple skins for the same units
I love the concept and I hope this is just testing the waters or something but the achievement is so trivial that there s no point to it at all Two wins in any mode means that anyone playing the game at all will get this almost immediately Here s hoping they explore the opposite extreme as well and give us some difficult to earn skins
The problem is it says TO SEE IT in game you have to have this it should be to see it for your own units and everyone else should see it regardless
No it s just saying that the skin doesn t work in WoL or HotS
I personally like skins and customization and I think they re overall good for the game certainly better than NOT having them available BUT one of the most attractive things about skins in Dota or CS to me is that not everyone has easy access to them skins being somewhat unique even if we can t trade them right off the bat or if they were tradable somehow even if they aren t directly buyable would be a really cool concept to me Rare Unique Drops through randomization or even making some of the archievements to unlock them ridiculously difficult would make skins more meaningful I think that even if skins didn t have a monetary value at all uniqueness would make them way cooler to showcase Not to say that this is the right time for that to be implemented as you do want common skins and this is a good start on that regard but I do think it would be cool to explore other options that will generate more discussion and hype around them in the future This is all subjective opinion of course curious to read what the rest of you guys think on this topic Anyway huge props to Blizzard for getting things moving this is another step in the right direction combined with Ladder incentives for NA and EU the last couple of days have been great from their end of things though I do wish IEM had been a bit better promoted
That would actually be a good way to promote otherwise pretty dead game mode If they would give us unranked FFA back
You re a madman I love it
Ya hopefully this is just proof that the technology for skins is finally there
It s always been there have you not unlocked the leveling skins
Have you not unlocked meme kappa achievements
Ya of course I was referring to the fact that for years blizzard has used this excuse to delay LAN chatrooms cross region play additional skins voice packs etc When asked Blizzard simply tells people that the technology just isn t there yet
Do you have a link to that because that seems retarded lol
Here s a quote about chatrooms and crossrealm play from a while back http www teamliquid net forum starcraft 2 128014 blizzard no plans for chatrooms crossrealm play They ve also said it multiple times about starcraft 2 LAN Here is TB making fun of it https www youtube com watch v jKUgbk2cBTs I also remember them saying similar things about skins and or voice packs at blizzcon but I can t find the old blizzcon videos because of copyright They have also used the same excuse about changing UI elements in diablo 3 It s a ridiculous excuse It s just a dodge of the quesiton
Yeah I think it was Dustin who said that every skin they add increases the RAM requirements of the game They didn t want to add more to decrease performance
Skins could also give you a way to proud of something outside of the ranked system That would be cool because most people will not be super high ranked by nature and they would be able to chase cool goals anyway
Droppable skins would be an interesting concept So maybe if you finish an achievment you can see the item n the foor in game
Agree with this 100
im sure they will provide harder to get skins if this one is so easy then perhaps they just have a lot to hand out in the future
I have to disagree with this I love the idea of skins being earned rather than randomly unlocked
previous skins for overlord zergling supply depot were all pretty easy to get and ultralisk thor colossus are all through purchasing more expensive versions of the game which is fine but really easy to get as well
That s why levels are a thing we ve won skins for units and buildings before through levelling our races up like Overlords for level 20 Zerg and Lings for 30 Zerg They could just add a new skin for every 5 levels especially considering that levelling up takes a long time on the later levels and I m betting levels above 50 would take a very long time to get That d definitely make skins more valuable definitely made skins like the Marine and Ling skins more rewarding once I got them
Yeah but in my case I ve been the max level zerg for as long as the leveling system has existed 5 years and everyone I play with has those skins too
What is this ladder incentive I keep hearing everyone talk about
I agree but This is a campaign skin Its purpose appears to be getting campaign players to try multiplayer
Exactly I love the idea of the skins Went to see the conditions for unlocking this one and bahahahaha
I agree with a lot of this having it gated from a hard achievement or one that takes a while to get adds value to it My biggest fear is that some of them will be gated through attending certain events Imagine getting certain skins exclusively from attending Dreamhack IEM or even Blizzcon
LOL did that and it seemed to work just fine
Maybe add a Catz skin win 2 i na row vs Catz on ladder and you get a pipe or something
It would be cool if there was some rarity to skins but I frankly think that is asking way too much CSGO is a different animal I agree though about IEM we got to do a better job The dream is having integrated twitch inside the sc2 client
Or within the Blizz launcher itself so even people without sc2 can see it
What do you have to do to earn that achievement
Win 2 games of each Training Vs AI Unranked Ranked and Tournament Edit Got it wrong sorry The official post states that you have to play 2 games of those modes but the achievement description says you have to win them
Win 2 games in a tournament or win 2 tournaments
Win 2 Multiplayer games in the same mode Training Unranked Ranked Versus A I Tournament That s the official description the patch is already live on SEA at least so you can go check it by yourself
Win two games of each He did not specify 2 tournaments so pretty sure its games
Of each or in the same mode
it s in the same mode not each
CAN CONFIRM it is not of EACH only need to win 2 games of one category Just unlocked by doing only training
Jesus isn t this a bit too easy I mean I love that we are finally getting skins but at least ask for 10 ladder wins
I tend to agree but I liked getting my skin too
I think this is mostly a test to see how people react to it
easy race easy skins easy wins
http eu battle net sc2 en blog 20020255 You dont even have to win just play two games
Alieve gaem
NO WAAY Wrathwalkers
can someone please post some screenshots of the new icon art
WRATH WALKER SKINS BOYZZZ PogChamp http imgur com a wmnlX
https i imgur com 8shNLJE png Appears to be the Attack Animation
If that s actually the attack animation I m going to play mass colossus on ladder I love the evil lazOrz
It doesn t have that attack animation just the normal collosus one
That s looking quite cool Can t wait to get my hands on it
Holy shit this thing looks amazing
hell yeah
RIP CE buyers that skin is way cooler than the Purifer Colossus you get with the CE
I expect a lot of people will switch back to CE because it s more rare
But I get both Now I just need a shuffle option for skins
I m with you I ll try to get the second tomorrow At least I think it s basically saying there will be multiple skins for the same unit if it s carrying a message
Who build colossus anyway
Oh yeah it sucks But I don t think everyone is excited about this particular skin It s more about proof of concept and hope that Blizzard will continue doing this for all units
Seems like I have to go back to playing with Colossi
Fuck that s cool time to switch races
Technology is here bois
WHAT THE FUCK SKINS YES
I love these kind of updates Just awesome small quality of life changes
Good stuff Is this a new page for patch notes or something btw
That page has always been there
You guys Guys Guys Colossus are actually useful
is the patch already live I can t find the achivement
Apperantly it s win 2 games in each of the following modes Training Unranked Ranked Versus A I Tournament
2 wins in any of those modes
Im still on 3 1 1 so not for me
A step in the right direction
SKIIIIIIIIIINS GAME IS SAVED BOIISSS
Cant find the achievement though
Since the patch isn t live you can t see it I guess you gotta wait but it s getting two wins on Training Unranked or Ranked Vs AI Tournament
skins via achievements is awesome
but that means no 2000 knife colossus skins
cant find the achievement
It will appear once the patch is live
The patch isn t out yet is it No one has pics of the new ability icons I m curious what they re doing to burrow after all these years Also no new art for the liberator range upgrade haha I guess we ll have the BB gun for a little longer
i hope for more taldarim skins would totally make me switch over from zerg main to protoss if i could rock a full taldarim set
this is sick Thanks Blizzard now I m going to hunt this skin
CAN CONFIRM it is not of EACH only need to win 2 games of one category Just unlocked by doing only training
Great to have some new skins but why colossus I mean they have 2 skins already and nobody uses them anyway
Gotta start somewhere don t have to go big right off the bat D
Sounds like a good move to try and encourage the players to use less used units in my book
And Colossus do get used but almost only in PvT recently since most Terran pros seem to be dealing with Disruptors so well this past month We just don t see them every game like in HotS thanksfully
I think Colossus are pretty good in PvZ against Lurkers I find using them is a lot more efficient than Disruptors disruptors are better versus ravagers though if you happen to have a blink stalker army
Lurkers have the same range as LOTV Colo 9 and do bonus damage against armor Colo is not that useful when compared to Disruptor which outranges lurkers 13 9
the colossus has always had 9 range
Wrong during LOTV beta it was dropped to 8 range
Ah that s right I was wondering how you mixed that up cause i don t think there is a single 8 range unit or ever was except that change Hard to compare disruptor shots with colossus attacks They both play very differently but colossus are good at kiting a lurker army huge distances while sniping at them
Colossi have range 9 6 3
During LOTV beta it had range 8 5 3
I thought it was 6 2
They have the same range actually anyway the reason I find it more effective is because Disruptor balls are very valuable so using 2 of them on 1 lurker maybe 3 if they re clumped up seems really inefficient I ve had better success with them especially considering the nature of how their AoE is
It s like the blue flame buff they gave hellions
Reminded me of this https youtu be cLtcsIGEXAw t 1m34s 4Head
Nobody uses it Do you have any usage data on how often it s used or are you just using anecdotal data
They are far from as strong as in hots at high level I have only really seen them a little bit in PvT Then again this update is mostly for plat and below where collosus is used frequently because its easier to use
Maybe he follows the SC2 scene and knows it like everyone else who also watches pro games
Pro games are not the only games being played and not every player studies those games Some people just find the unit fun and plays it because they are bad ass
You couldn t be more right But then again QiQQu s point is for people who follows this reddit but more importantly the pro scene And so is my comment
While it isn t used much in pro games saw it a bit at DH Leipzig though it s still being played on ladder a lot And that means over 99 of the player base will be able to see use this skin and be happy about it Hardly nobody
Welmu also has been streaming a lot and has been using it I don t think anyone would say it s used as often as HotS but it s used more now than in LotV beta for two reasons Terrans have learned to split against it and they buffed it s range back up
Played on the ladder a lot Can you back this up I really doubt it And did I actually say something about the skin Fucking idiot Learn how to read
Whoa man Calm down Was it wrong to assume that your comment in a thread that is about the new unit skin is also about said unit skin If it s not maybe you shouldn t post I see Colossi in a fair amount of matches on ladder and so do the people I usually play with Considering that at lower levels the balance issues are non existant and Colossi are much easier to use than Disruptors I don t think it s wrong to assume that they are still being played The original comment was worded in a way that implied that nobody ever uses them at all and that this would make the skin useless
Technically it s wrong Otherwise I would ve either replied directly to the original comment and not to the guy asking for proofs or said something about the skin You made a good point about Colossi being easier and maybe funnier than disruptors But you failed to see that the comment is for the balance aware part of the community just by being in this reddit Second the original comment was a hyperbolic satire and you clearly failed to see that which is a good reason to get offended in my book No offense intended P
Ah yes skins
Thank god now people can shut up about Blizzard not delivering Edit The humor is it s for the one Protoss unit that is rarely used anymore
not just that but there is already a skin for the colossi if only it was the talldarem immortal skin
They rushed out an already made campaign unit skin to placate because of all the negative feedback You wouldn t have seen this skin if not for all of the people that can shut up So maybe they shouldn t
My infant seems to think he won t ever get fed unless he cries So you re probably right
I am pretty sure this is the most perfect answer ever given Congratulations
That s an incredible analogy
When does the patch come to EU
Wednesday as usual
It s a good direction Although it s a shame Protoss may be deciding between Purifier and Tal Darim Purifier still looks better for me
Anyone have a screenshot of the skin
And colossus got suddenly viable
I own both WoL and HotS and I can tell you that the HotS skins like the Zergling and Overlord Mutant skins do not work in WoL It s probably because they don t want to support potentially three different versions of a skin Currently most if not all of the animations of units with skins are the same but in the future these units may get different weapons or abilities in LotV
Thanks I never looked into it myself and was curious your reasoning is sound
Skins could also give you a way to proud of something outside of the year when they start adding way more things in the game to deploy new maps
Burrow looks the same What did they update about it
Patch isn t live yet
Yeah it is New achievement is in there and all the other icons listed are different
Should be way harder to achieve now everyone will have it by barely playing Make people earn it
I might actually build colossi now O excited for this to be starting now I hope that this is only the beginning for customization
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Now can I haz tank skin prease
Since the patch contains
Dear Blizz would you consider placing them on top of the liberators whom design is totally not interesting
what a gamechanger
Blizzard don t forget to add a setting to not show skins
Gotta log in and he that skin
I liked the patch unexpected changes but with so many bugs on the client not even a single note about fixing groups fixing auto tournaments and other problems
And people said they abaddon thier game lol
New skins are cool The most complained skins are probably those of the cyclone and of the liberators whom design is totally not interesting Dear Blizz would you consider placing them on top of the new skins list Cheers
I like the linerator reminds me of the valkyrie and i think you can see its function by its design Cyclone on the other hand is hideous Youre right
Is the patch LIVE Releasing skin like its nothing They should hype it up like riot with teasers maybe Announce it officially I mean why are they releasing it like it s a bug fix patch
Blizz you sure you ve not forgotten anything I don t know like the most requested icon replacement Probably the only requested icon replacement the liberator upgrade icon
Is this some kind of sick joke Whats a Collosi
some statue in greece
Are they listening
Of course the first one they put in is for the most useless unit in the game rofl
Swarm Host
Swarm Host might have that beat I saw colo in proleague last night at least
True
WOW Skins incoming oh wait Skin incoming I mean I don t want to complain actually but at least one for each race would have been something to start with
Why make a skin for a unit that I cannot use anymore
Well if the pros use it in PvT why can t you especially since it s easier than Disruptor in that matchup
If you ask me all the tal darim shit looked cooler
Who the fuck makes collosus
is that all the patch contains Just a skin some icon art Thanks i guess but i was hoping to see some of the map changes they had talked about Oh well least its better than nothing Lvie Gaem
Why would the artists have any say on the map changes
I don t think you need to patch the game to deploy new maps They get streamed to you anyway Best patch so far
How do they even waste energy in this shit
I thought new patch was supposed to address the matchmaking and leave league bug
Jesus fucking christ there s no pleasing some people
You have no idea
Seriously
Well the matchmaking bugs are fairly important considering Blizzard is handing out money for your ladder position which can be greatly negatively effected by these bugs I was kind of expecting a mention of them in the patch notes as well but I totally wasn t expecting a skin which is really cool
Well considering I doubt their artists can code this didn t impact any other patch they are unrelated
Obviously they are unrelated and nobody in this comment thread insinuated they were we were just surprised that there were no ladder related changes in the patch I m not even outraged they aren t there I just had thought that there would be
It s almost like Starcraft is a massively complex piece of software and the team has to work on multiple things with overlapping timelines CRAZY RIGHT
I don t get it why can t Blizz just add this line of code after the game loads getBugs fixAll
But zerg need their bugs to win with
Quite obvious that they transferred over some artist from Heroes to get some damage control done in SC2 Feels like Blizz isn t touching the game unless there is too much negativity
Blizzard please comment on the disruptor bug Are you aware of the problem
What s the bug
Are you talking about how units will run towards the disruptor ball That isn t a bug and is poorly visualized The units actually run towards the disruptor itself the ball is just in the path Why do they run to the disruptor Because that is how it works for every unit when it argos the other If a tank fires at your units and you have vision your units run towards the tank Same thing
I think you can argue it s partially a bug If a disruptor is outside the scan range but in vision and the disruptor shot is in scan range as well the units run to the disruptor instead of the shot
I understand why this happens The bug is that your units react when they see the nova They should react when the nova goes off and only then move to attack the disruptor
Still not sure that is a bug I d have to see some other delayed damage unit to compare Take the tank again Are the units responding to the explosion or the firing of the shot Hard to say since both happen at the same time I guess you could test something like the infestors and its fungal growth But I think the infestor is in range to quick and will be auto targeted anyway The tank and disruptor are special due to their great range beyond scan range
Clever ploy into tricking Protosses into making Colossi
It s working on me wp Blizzard
Just wait we ll get the craziest skin you ve ever seen for Swarm Hosts next
A polished turd is just a turd leave the poor thing alone
That s awesome honestly
Thank you for your honesty
have you seen the collectors addition skin That is awesome not this dark piece of crap
THIS IS A LESS THAN SUBTLE ATTEMPT TO BRING THE COLOSSUS BACK INTO THE META I RESENT THIS KIM
So we got a collosi skin for collectors now a newer cooler skin for free Im grateful for skins but why start with a unit that litterally just got a skin
I don t know but I guess it s easy to make Tal Darim lasers and to also basically say In the future you ll get skins for achievments and there will be skins for units that already have skins
I think they should give you the option of making your skins rotate That way you can actually collect them and still enjoy them all Maybe you can disable some you don t like in the rotation like the original one
Lol my first thought glad I didn t buy that CE just for the skin
Especially since you don t build them now anyway
my thoughts exactly why not put this on a unit we will actually use see maybe oh i dont know an IMMORTAL
I still prefer the collectors edition one
my thoughts exactly I want a zerg freebie for the ultralisk now me zerg main
Thor needs a re visit as well
I d be really happy with this skin for the hellion too http vignette2 wikia nocookie net starcraft images 8 89 OutbackHunter SC2 Rend1 jpg revision latest cb 20160103123837
I would love that
A paintjob like the civilian vehicles would also be cool
Too bad nobody will ever see it Cool skin tho
Looks sick
Damn this skin looks pretty freaking cool I like the direction Blizz is going with this idea Hopefully there will be more skins to come
Looking good
Would love a hydra skin that makes it look more like the SC1 Hydra complete with the spitting
All I want is a sick ass disruptor skin even if it was the old model of the replicant
Oh good a skin for a unit that is too awful to ever use
Very happy to see that the skin is earned rather than bought Like portraits skins should be something you work towards
BASED GODS BLIZZARD PRAISE BE TO DAVID KIM
so why make this skin available for non lotv users when it will only be displayed when you set the expansion level to lotv
It is great that it looks beautiful while not too different so it s always very easy to distinguish the unit on a first glance I was worried that the new skins may require for people to keep in mind various looks of units
I d think that the achievements to unlock the skins would be on the harder side that it d literally be an achievement you can show off A good achievement with such reward could be all missions on brutal or completing all missions of SC Master http starcraft wikia com wiki StarCraft Master It was very hard for me to complete all the missions and felt proud once I did but then felt saddened when they gave out the portrait only for completing 28 missions while 2 30 were significantly harder than the rest
I don t plat Protoss but that looks pretty sick PogChamp
At least make me work for it Blizzard
Hope they change the hallucination skin as well
This isn t going to make people start using this unit Blizzard trying to balance through skins because they can t do it any other way
This is the smartest thing I ve read in this thread so far
Brilliant Bring a new skin for colossus into the game when nobody uses colossi
with the shitty stats on the colossus they should at least lower the cost to convince me to build them again
Yes they can they just need 2 games in the same format any of those not ALL of those
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH That makes more sense
Wonder when they gonna give us things for Terran and Zerg players jk they never will its blizzard
I really hope we get a way of disabling them anytime because that s going to be goddamn annoying and distracting to face
If you can qualify for these tournaments Blizz will still pay It s only if you don t qualify and want to play in the open brackets that the team or player has to cover costs
Do you honestly not understand how they make money You pay Twitch to not see Twitch ads Twitch still gets money from that BasetradeTV does not get your Turbo money It s amazing how ignorant people are about the free content they receive
G2 was Ruins of Seras
Technically 2 Adept now 3 shot larvae instead of 2 shot Not a big deal but still a nerf p
Yeah it was the perfect thing to do if they pulled their drones away and you were waiting for the shade to finish Now you need a third adept
Technically he s still doing the Daily Just not the Starcraft Daily
Congratulations BaeReign and Funk
I m actually making some tonight D So next episode should have something
The current meta in LotV is to open either Blink or Adepts and go into a Chargelot Archon Immortal Storm style You can see this in dozens of games on KR and many foreign Protosses do this as well
I also had the same issue with map downloading when this started happening so I think it might
BlizzardCS tweeted that they are having authentication errors on their server This could be related might need to wait on Blizzard s end on this Check up on BlizzardCS on Twitter to see when that issue gets resolved then see if it fixes this one
obv gonna win blizzcon 2016
Natural is a very good Terran on the Korean ladder This is his first time joining any kind of team so hopefully we get to see more of him I don t know anything about bonobona Could be a player who changed his name or maybe another ladder hero who s been performing well
Well what s nice about that is it makes it easier if you pay attention to know which Nexus is chroning what if you just spammed all of your chronos so you can go and individually change them if need be I usually just switch them out individually so it hasn t been much of an issue for me
It actually uses whichever Nexus is closer to the building from what I could tell when I was testing this
It s a bug and they re on holiday break Probably someone just logged on during their off time and mentioned it They just got back into the office yesterday
TorkkSC
They already said theyre looking into it 4 days ago Looks like no one wants to research before posting here or making replies
It was found by Katatonik while Crank was streaming even says it in that tweet p
It s helpful for nexus to make sure the pylon is close enough when trying to put them down fast and want at max distance for most range on PO
I don t need a pony to tell me I suck people on ladder tell me all the time so HA FeelsBadMan
Especially when you win against them They really let you know how bad of a player you are
I don t get it You re not very good You shouldn t be beating me Guy I was beating in bronze league
GMs say the same shit
You get the same shit everywhere My favorite is when you defend someone s all in but haven t killed them yet because you re making sure there is no way you can lose WEOW U SUCK SO MUCH NOB HOW AM I STILL ALIVE U HAVEN T KILLED ME YET SCRUB LOL SO ABD
Im gold but i love this kind of chat I always reply with 3 for extra salt
I normally say something along the lines of aww do you need a hug
I see you got a polite one then
I ve never understood this mindset I ve had some close competitive games Games I would consider to be the definition of a Good Game If I pull off a slim win my opponent tells me how trash I am and I only won because of X Really We re obviously evenly matched Why are you even playing if you re going to be a miserable shit after a game like that
Shit man I ll be happy when I get gold Rank 1 Silver last season beating golds consistently beat a gold in my placement match put back into silver thanks David Kim
You ll get it this season I guarantee it
Sounds like you re due for a promotion Keep up the good work
Yeeeah my buddy and I were high diamond in archon last season got placed in silver after beating a gold our first match yesterday Sigh Took like 10 wins just to move up to plat Fun fact we were GM in archon for about two weeks during the beta And by God even that felt glorious D
Why not be happy now Enjoy just playing the game You can be even happier when you hit gold Also don t put too much stock into the leagues Some people don t play often enough to rank up I ve seen plat MMR players sitting in silver You might beat a silver who has a higher MMR than the last gold opponent you faced
Try playing more than 15 games a season lol
You forgot a zero at the end And yeah maybe But with a full time job schooling and other responsibilities I won t apologize for 150 games
If anything be proud of it its more than your average redditor in their lifetime
honestly 150 games a season is actually pretty good
I play less almost every season and I was in diamond last season but haven t placed myself since the new season 150 games is definitely enough to improve consistently over time I started 2010 in bronze lol
My 600 games a season are just because I have the time Don t know if I should feel good sitting here in low master
Hey man similar thing happened to me But you ll easily make gold this season and you ll have more time this season lemme know if u wanna play
If you are consistent in 150 games there is no way you d not be promoted I feel like there is more to the story
I don t get it hows it so hard to get gold I had the game for a week and hit plat without really trying lol Game too ez And when I made a post because I had no friends to brag too everyone on reddit said well plats not that hard to get
there s should be an addendum that says Not even on NA
Have you looked into the eye of a horse the black void https www youtube com watch v 9iSb5 X 2do
For me the pony would simply say you ll never be plat I would be so happy for GM to be even in the equation
What race do you play can you play NA timezone do you have a mic and do you want a former masters now diamond scrub to give you some tips We can get you in plat ezpz I promise

Who the hell upvotes this garbage
We have never gotten a gold base natural before This is going to be crazy I hope in a good way
icarus
Icarus was a mixed mineral line with a single vespene geyser this will be a new thing altogether If they want to swap the Bases the best way around it it would be to swap the near 3rd with the natural instead of what would be 4th with the natural because in ZvP Zerg would have easy access to the 2 gold bases if the Z goes for a quick 3 hatch while the toss player will stay with a single gold base and given the high extra income given by gold bases in low worker scenarios leaving the frontal base as a third would only increase the income differential between the two races which atm is already problematic on the map the reason for this change PvT is also a problematic MU in the map and usually before this change P player would take the frontal 3rd base compared to the fourth with this change you are creating a new dynamic in the map where players can create new strategies that allow require them to stretch a bit more and take the far away 4th and gain the extra income from it which would otherwise not happen As a nail in the coffin for the idea of swapping the natural for the near 3rd we also have the max worker efficiency as a cap which for gold bases is 12 this means that for players to efficiently take 3 bases they require to have around 40 workers as a minimum and that s a threshold of income enough for some pretty nasty timing pushes Image of how the map would look http i imgur com lOuFmcY jpg The other day I was trying to come up with fixes for Ulrena and Central Protocol which are the most extreme maps that have the hardest fixes I m quite pressured by time from RL things and the map contest submission deadline but I ll see what can I do regarding the issues of the map specially Central Protocol I have some ideas that may be interesting for all of you but I need to flesh them out first Edit came back here are a couple of the ideas I have about how to fix Central Protocol 1 http imgur com WeueQKY 2 http i imgur com htHViTU Change the backdoor into giving the players a third base with this change the map will still have issues and given the layout of central protocol there are no fixes to that without things like half bases or rocks with extra HP which on their own could fairly easily solve the issues of the map but I digress With these changes the map flow would be quite altered but because the map was conceived with a backdoor in mind there are no other heavier changes needed such as moving or splitting bases yet there still would be other issues like the difference between the attacker and defender distances when the defender is trying to take his 3rd and the map would need to lose the horizontal spawn capabilities
Rock Towers at the natural ramps on Central Protocol maybe Then if the destructible rocks get taken out in the main shoot down the Rock Tower at the natural ramp and just defend the main ramp
You Rang
I will be testing out flying my CC to the natural D
Gangnam terran is back
Oh no
Also CC first into 10 rax
Those games were always fun If nothing else it will make the map wonky instead of just a brutal slog against zerg
Huh Guess it s time to send an early scout to pylon block it
Flying CCs anyone
We re glad to hear your positive reactions to these changes Please feel free to add any additional feedback about these specific changes or others you may have
http www teamliquid net forum sc2 maps 503204 2 creative nylon terraces Please
I prefer Big Game Hunters
Blizzard or KeSPA STX version
Dude blizzard good job if ur not gonna give us new maps atleast you gave us something now people will actually play central and lerilak
Amazing changes Go Blizzz teeaaaammmmm
Love it any change is appreciated Didn t know blizzard browsed reddit though must be demotivating looking at the comment sections some times
Blizzard ran out of good ideas then they started with shitty ideas finally they decided to make use of crowdsourcing their balance team to the internet Who fucking knew good ideas could come from the masses what could have been if they listened back in 2012
The changes are good but why is it that we can t switch 2 of these maps for the GSL ones Some of the most beloved maps where introduced by the GSL and the community wants it What s the reason against it
Speculation performance related reasons since these maps have rain and lightning and other effects that reduce fps
I guess blizzard has a different vision concerning maps than gsl has They ve repeatedly said they really want to focus on a diverse mappool for lotv with some normal dusk towers and some crazy maps ulrena central protocol etc Gsl allways adds more standard maps because when they go for something crazy it gets vetoed to oblivion by the players Also blizzard has added gsl maps to the mappool before iron fortress comes to mind
It doesn t seem entirely clear so I hope you mind clarifying For Central Protocol would you be removing just the back door rocks or that ramp entirely
They mean removing the backdoor completely
Glad to see that you re making changes That being said I have been pretty critical of your team s general mapmaking prowess as a whole with the majority of SC2 s best maps all coming from the community outside of a handful Can you explain the thought process behind continuing to put out maps that are almost universally disliked by pros and community when you have more talented mapmakers constantly making new ones I understand the concept of designing around a certain gimmick playstyle although I believe that a good map allows for anything rather than forcing players into a certain style but why not just assign that map specific idea to a community mapmaker and ask them to come up with a few drafts compensate them and finetune accordingly
Great choices as to what to try on these maps I think next week is going to be a very fun one on ladder For Central Protocol have you thought about trying Rock Towers at the natural ramp I like keeping the destructible rocks for the main and getting rid of vertical spawns but I think adding Rock Towers on the natural ramp would be a really nice addition to the map
as long as you actually do something that s not shit ill always appreciate u blizzardman
can we get some non ladder fun maps such as in BW we had zero clutter awesome map to play on and as tastosis always says island maps
Disregarding whether or not these changes are good I love that Blizzard is willing to do this Even if it is not the changes everyone would like the fact that they are willing to change things take risks it s so good
Exactly It feels like now that the units are more locked down in this expansion they can start taking these risks It ll keep the player base AND the devs on their toes spurring on creativity This could be an awesome era of SC
This just in Richard Lewis will no longer be going on the b net forums too much positivity
I love it Solid changes It will be interesting to see how prion plays now
Very exciting
Gold base natural whaaaaaaaa
All the maps I vetoed Now I will give a chance to at least Lerilak and Prion Prion should be interesting I wonder how viable will Gangnam Terran be Very easy to wall off gold base safe natural main Vertical spawn on Central Protocol should be removed long ago just like horizontal spawn was quickly removed on Deadwing But I m happy this will be eventually changed It would be also great to see small changes to Central Protocol and Prion Terraces on the natural ramps so wall off would look like a proper wall not with those confusing space between ramp and a building that looks passable but it is a proper wall
Totally agreed even better just put Rock Towers at the natural ramps on Central Protocol
This rocks
This is gold
Goldilocks
No no rocks
Holy shit Gold base natural Thats fucking crazy
This is awesome we don t see much map tweaks any more Keep up the good work bliz
I m a recent arrival from Dota 2 I am still in awe at the fact that Blizzard actually talks to people
I hope you enjoy your stay here 3
Actually I really like the proposed changes I realllllly didn t like the backdoor aspect on central protocol Looking forward to it
I wonder if CC first followed up by 3 barracks to wall off the natural will be too strong
Vulnerable to cheese no If people play too greedy on this map cheese will also be more common
Not sure how vulnerable it really would be Any 1 base play is scouted easily by SCV scout and can be defended against Any two base play and you can pump out a huge marine army AND tech to something like siege tanks with that gold base The Barracks wall is stout and hard to take down by basically any T1 units that would come with an all in
Vulnerable to Reapers and Warp Prisms I think Probably not Oracles What s the fastest oracle out vs when those barracks start spitting out marines I do this on the south spawn of Asper Mountain and it CAN pay off 4v4 has a lot of variables though
Could Blizzard consider increasing the map pool to 9 These changes are great but I still think the community would love more maps to choose from
Amazing i am just loving this positive feedback we are getting now The community is starting to really respect it and i am feeling a lot more happier with the future of this game Thank you so much Blizzard
We did it reddit
USA USA USA
Thanks nice changes Wonder if Zerg will start playing 13 12 instead of hatch first on Prion
Ok terrans you have heard it here first float to your natural at the beginning then take your main as your natural
Delayed mining and a base that mines out faster If they want to do that then they can
But better income in the early phase also if you send your SCV to the gold base immediately and make a stop on your way to the natural with your command center so the the SCV can cash in you mitigate the early game loss And about the base that mines out faster that happens if you take it as your natural anyways not really a negative with the lift off strat
Ofc it is not gamebreaking it is just a variation in standard terran openers that can change the timings a bit I just like the idea behind lifting in general
It led to some pretty strong all ins in hots and that was a longer float distance
But this is against a player that gets a free gold and small ramp to defend it
So was hab station
1 base all ins were a big deal in HotS They are nowhere near as difficult to deal with in LotV I don t think this will be imbalanced
At least I don t have to play against 3rax reaper every game But maybe I should be careful what I wish for Cool map changes gogo
Damn this is awesome I can t believe how much communication we have with Blizzard I think the Prion Terrace gold base swap out should be swapped with the FOURTH actually just cause then zerg has less of an advantage at taking a gold 3rd that is riskier for terran and protoss to take I agree that zerg needs to be punished with the changes to this map so I think the tucked in 3rd being gold along with the natural would help protoss and terran not fall behind economically and still be playing not overly risky suggested Lerilak changes sound good I think this will help I m not sure about Protocol the map doesn t seem the best to me at its core I would much prefer to see maybe Rak Shir or Sky Shield http www teamliquid net forum starcraft 2 500891 2016 gsl s1 map pool from the SSL and GSL map pool be implemented as a replacement for Protocol If Protocol stays however the proposed changes sound like they would give protoss and terran some leeway
This is great TY DK
All of these are suggestions from the community That s awesome
Woohoo that s really great to hear
Does the map pool just not get changed for new seasons anymore Not especially excited about another three months of playing on the same maps even if they do get tweaked here and there
This is how things should work Prion would be the first map ever to have a gold expansion which should make things interesting
Overall I am SUPER STOKED for these changes Here are some of my spur of the moment thoughts Central protocol if rocks were removed there would be 2 entrances into the main This may be a bit overpowered for Zerg P Prion terraces making the natural a gold will certainly change play very significantly 1 base play will be less effective while 2 base timings will be SIGNIFICANTLY stronger as they will occur more quickly and with a bigger army However as Z as long as it s scouted properly 2 base timings should be no problem
I would love to play prion now
Great change for Prion
Wouldn t removing the back rocks for Central Protocol make your base way too open to attacks It s already a bit challenging to defend my natural against heaving Ling attacks but letting the Lings enter from the front and the back seems devastating
Mass widow mine will be viable wooo So much time spent working on the build in team games and now it s viable in 1v1 s
gold bases are the new rocks
I really hope this is the beginning of a better dialogue between the players and developers It s nice to see an outcome to our suggestions and the positive reaction from both players developers It s also nice to see people offering constructive criticism rather than I hate this map or this map is unbalanced
You mean like what has been going on all LotV beta
Change the snow white color on Protocol that might make people unveto it not fun to look at ugly background sharp and uncomfy
Well better than playing the garbage pool from last season but not by much Can we replace Protocall with anything I d rather play Metalopolis or Tal darim instead TBH
Not sure if Blizzard doing good job now or Blizz was doing such a bad job for so long that this is only a decent job but it seems amazing in comparison philosoraptor either way yay that they are actually making real changes to maps now something they basically didn t do before
if you buy the argument that the pool is imbalanced why not just change the map pool and give us a fresh season experience Why waste time with this half measure
I m no expert but I think the reasoning is there There simply isn t enough time to get reasonable maps created or even get maps from the community which despite intuition it takes a fair bit of time to go from community map to ladder map As such instead of rushing to create new maps for this season they are waiting until next season and in the mean time are fixing the more pressing issues with the current map pool
Not to mention that what if the map you switch them in for are not balanced So instead of rolling the dice and hoping the new maps are balanced they fix the imbalances
Well they have to change something im all for it Although i cant help but think that theyre just putting bandaids on it while they could just get rid of the maps in favor for better ones
Gold natural non zerg favored right get out your vetoes people
I disagree with your disagreement It is trivial to wall off as a terran on that ramp Just turtle it up a little and you are g2g To be honest this will probably mean I stop reaper rushing zerg on this map
The larva mechanics are what makes this so zerg favored in my opinion This will make it really easy to hold off early pushes since they won t need as many drones They are also the only race that can basically take a natural with impunity CC first will become the only option tvz imo and that s really not that strong a build since you will still lose to ravager all ins that are even stronger now
what are mules chopped liver
Mules dont generate extra minerals on gold bases which is the primary reason why gold bases do not favor the terran race What is your point
Gold bases don t favor Terran jesus fuck What s a Marine
Zerg has about 4 extra larva to work with Do you believe that the extra income on your side and therefore faster army production won t balance this out How I understand where your argument comes from but in practice I m 99 sure that a natural gold won t have the sort of impact you think it will
Zerg currently can take the 3rd which is gold as natural vs protoss vs terra I dunno if it s really viable While no other race can do it vs zerg So yes it is not zerg favored
They can try vs terran but will lose to 3 rax Now they can take it without losing to 3 rax Definitely don t see how this is bad for zerg since taking the far 4th is also way easier for zerg than the other races Might help pvz but I can t speak to that matchup
No one says it s bad for zerg It s good for the other races because Zergs were taking the gold first anyway This change just makes it so all the races can take the gold first It s a good change if they want to keep the gold bases
This may be the case in pvz but not tvz I go 3 rax reaper every game on prion to deny this because you basically lose if you don t against a good zerg This will just make it easier for them to do vs terran We won t know until we play it but I m fairly certain this will make tvz completely imbalanced on prion
While it makes it easier for a two base zerg to get the gold it also means the Terran will have a gold That in itself evens it out a bit Terran was already forced to stay on two bases for quite some time Now one if those bases is gold for Terran Faster third or earlier extra rax Not much better for zerg but a lot better for Terran
If everyone can reliably take the gold it is non zerg favored that simple Before the third bases were gold and they were wide open and far favoring zerg
one basing is so HOTS it s 2016 baby live a little
The return to a gold base is way higher for zerg than the other races because of the larva mechanic That s why I think this change will make tvz unwinnable
Explain please I disagree but I need to figure out why first
There is a drone unit trade off for zerg players that is crucial to game balance This means that they need 4 less drones to fully saturate a gold base and can also saturate faster because of the extra mineral income Theoretically this can translate into significantly more lings and roachs for early game defense with no tradeoff The midgame is already extremely difficult if they get both golds and now they can just get there more easily I think this might help the balance of pvz but not tvz
How is having 4 extra sets of lings materially different from having an extra rax and a couple marines which terran would get if they produce SCVs at the same rate they otherwise would
In your scenario zerg is maintaining constant income comparing gold and non gold at the cost of fewer workers and therefore more army You could just as easily maintain constant workers and therefore have increased income and more army It all leads to more army
Basically the zerg either can catapult their econ with 4 extra drones or make 4 extra lings for defense and everything else stays the same Terrans can probably get a faster 3rd cc and a couple extra raxes but zerg still comes out way ahead
I understand your disagreement but in the current state zergs are already taking the normal 3rd before the natural anyway A gold natural just allows terran and protoss to secure an early gold too
The returns from a gold base are way higher for zerg This just makes it harder to punish with 3 rax
This comment is utterly pointless You say that as if the map isn t already vetoed You may not think the change isn t enough but it s still better then the old version Just leave you veto where it is and cry less
I don t veto it I just 3 rax to deny the gold 2nd base
Make main base gold Problem solved
Yes yes yes yes this is fucking awesome this is the best WCS update I ve seen yet holy shit
GLHF
I m kind of shocked this isn t 1 on this subreddit by a wide margin I mean IEM is going on and they re some great games but this is giant news
but but but there are funny memes
If they removed region locking and allowed Koreans to compete in them it would dramatically increase the quality of practice in EU NA At least then the Korean players will be contributing to the practice pool and not merely flying in and smashing the foreigners and then flying home to practice on their superior server I really like the idea of the FaceIt Proleague they have for CS GO where they essentially use a ladder system and the winner gets a massive cash prize Things like that can do wonders for the foreign scene to incentivize better practice But baby steps I guess
amazing I am so happy to read this
Happy will be happy too D
LOL so true
It s definitely a step in the right direction but to be honest it feels like more of a test to see if they can do more with the ladder In reality this will only make ladder NA ladder at least competitive for about 4 days from where GM opens and the deadline closes After the deadline the ladder will go back to being dead for 3 months until the next regional challenger
This is awesome The ladder needs work but when it s working as intended and people are using it to qualify for stuff the quality of practice for foreigners should improve dramatically
My only concern is hackers and win traders We all need to put on our Avilo faces and report any suspicious activity Kappa
Well in the top 16 GM I think it would be very obvious when the guy will come to the tournament
But would be taking the spot of a deserving person which is not ideal
hacking could also accure in the regular qualifier I don t see how the risk is higher with the new ESL ladder format
Ye if anything the risk is lower Maybe you can go through a qualifier bracket hacking Being consistent around the top 16 all the time playing against the best without being caught Not so much Also I can t really imagine someone dumb enough claiming a spot hacking and actually taking it If this goes wrong he would probably lynched live but no way a decent amount of time of his life wouldn t be fucked As the internetz doesn t fuck around with persons like this with repercussions to RL
Just ask Lilbow what happens when you utterly bomb at a live event
Occur
Thank you
That s true but i think boosting and wintrading would be a bigger problem I can remember how Destiny did something similiar like ESL now and caught someone wintrading I mean it s still amazing but you have to observe the matchhistory of the players carefully
this should be an easy task for blizzard
Not only would he be taking a spot he would be stealing at least 400
I think if he gets banned due to hacking he won t be given that money
It s true Maybe they ll enforce their security test for these players And they did it just after a patch too so i think most hacks are broken again
last tournament there were ladder requirements for pro players got busted for win trading you think they wont do it again to get into the top 16 Life just got caught up in a match fixing scandal and you think NA pros are above win trading
And what about the random ladder bugs you often see better people locked in 1 in Masters or the GM fills so fast then better people can t get in etc what about that stuff
This sounds great Surely this is also better for newcomers to the foreign pro scene edit bunny disagrees https twitter com Liquid Bunny status 694203402453147648 https twitter com Liquid Bunny status 694203437735612416
If some of the top 16 were already qualified or if they would refuse the invitation wouldn t the invitation go to the next people down the ranking
I hope so That would make sense
They have a similar thing in Hearthstone if im not wrong I havent followed that scene for a bit but during the first Season of Championship the top X of the ladder got a shot at the World stage If you already previously had that Top X spot it would go to the next person down i e If you were 16th place and top 15 go but Rank 3 got it last month it essentially skips over him and the person in 16th place gets it None the less its something people have wanted for a while
You would think but I doubt they d give up the cash prize
In the article it says that they would People already qualified are invited to attend but if they place in the top two the invitation will go to the next highest participant
It s positive Bunny tends to see the worst of everything which I understand as a normal thing for many progamers Here s a retired pro s opinion https twitter com EGThorZaIN status 694230817535606784
Bunny doesn t see the worst in anything he just looks objectively at it and points out the flaws It s called constructive criticism
He presents his opinion constructively and earnestly sure but that doesn t necessarily mean he s right
That s true but it s important to take criticism srsly and see how legit it is instead of just undermine the brought up point with sentence like oh you re just so neagtive Positive and negative feedback should be valued equaliy to learn from them to make Starcraft and our Scene a bit better with each change Well h just in my opinion
but what is his point That the best people get the money and not someone else Can t see the problem here In my opinion it will not necessary the best player it will be the player who plays most on a top level So you have to play a lot and not just win 10 games withing one evening
do the koreans have ingame stuff like this So that anyone with the game has a chance
i think the goal is to improve the overall quality and competetiveness of the ladder from which of course all players profit in the end
Very good point of cause the already qualified shouldn t be participants
It s actually good that the qualified participate We want more pros playing on the ladder If it works out that they win and take the top money the players placing next in the tournament will still get a qualifier spot Works for everyone
You misunderstood sure the qualified play on ladder and are probably around the top 16 but they should not participate in the event so if the already qualified are within the top 16 the spot goes to the 17th 18th and so on those who are already qualified for WCS really don t need this event
I see I was wrong And I think I kinda disagree and have to agree with Bunny https twitter com Liquid Bunny status 694203437735612416 The reason they do this is not to have a as high level as posssible event but to give more players incentive to try harder on ladder and strengthen the ladder quality overall So there is no real reason the already qualified should participate in the event itself because they will probably wreck most others as they are top level for so long and the gap is to big But anyway it s a good think overall and should happen more often looking forward to more of this
Imagine if they did this for KR too I can t fathom what the KR ladder would look like without barcodes
One day maybe
wait why the hell is it not in korea I could see some super kids coming out of there with a chance like this
There s no such thing as WCS KR it s GSL SSL etc
I think that would be beyond entertaining to watch
WE FUCKING DID IT BOYS
You ve been calling for this for a while now what are your thoughts on their execution of the idea
Hype traiiiiiiiiin
brb ladder
You did it Totalbiscuit
This is going to be a nice increase practice quality for heavy ladder players

Does this mean that people from Mexico Central America and South American have no way of participating since when is Mexico not part of North America btw And why is that when Africa and the Middle East are explicitly included in EU
Great for the scene blizzard calling it
Yes yes yes yes this is the the best update I ve ever seen Blizzard do to SC2 holy fuck this is awesome
Destiny top 16 NA
So awesome you needed to post it twice
Double post double HYPE
Think this should have come before the lock out of Korea or would it have made any difference to the level of foreign players
That sounds great Hopefully no top 16 players get locked out of GM due to it being full x
A realistic fear Polt and Neeb got locked out the second half of last season despite both having two of the best win rates
Yeah that s really annoying It was mostly due to the weird reset in the middle of the season Over the course of an entire season the best players almost always get in Neeb s win rate was completely absurd and probably would have made gm again if he kept playing on NA but it seems like he switched to other servers after the reset
Also just realized Neeb and Polt don t qualify for this since they already qualified for the Winter Finals so while they will ladder they likely won t have motivation to grind ladder
Well 400 just for being top 16 I don t see why they would skip this
Getting top 16 is a lot of work not in terms of skill but just the hours needed to grind that high especially for someone like Polt who isn t even in the country right now and won t be back for a few days
THey actually do qualify for this They can play both Basically they dont get the trip to WCS out of it but they still get the cash
I phrased it wrong you are right but they don t qualify THROUGH this instead the next person would take their spot Mostly I was saying it s not be as motivated especially someone like Polt who even the first place prize isn t significant Thanks for letting me clarify
I really hope their new ladder system has a fluid GM One can only hope
Yeah as good as this sounds I feel like they jumped the gun a bit before they got new GM implemented from Ladder2 0 I feel like to get this to work they really need GM Masters to be a continuous stream of people instead of completely separate They also need to make the game hack proof but thats a bigger ask
Oh wow this sounds pretty neat
Really excited for this
Would love if it would be for top 32 Its REALLY REALLY hard to get into top 16 in European ladder
Fair point and something we considered but scrapped afterall for Katowice because of the tight timeframe Definitely something to keep in mind for the future
Can I ask why people in South and Central America are excluded from being able to participate and Mexico I guess which is totally part of North America by the way Especially when Africa and the Middle East is explicitly included in EU
Because they have their own Challenger tournament in form of Copa America http esports viustudio com blizzard entertainment and viu studio announce the starcraft ii copa america 2016
I think south and central america have copa america which has a much larger prize pool than this and I think top 1 or 2 qualify for the WCS finals in Katowice Winner of this region gets 4000 and travel to Katowice Mexico is also included in this despite continent difference Which means this is where you will see major vs kelazhur Catz etc
would be much easier minus the maphackers
And the leave league sniping
Is that still not fixed I can t imagine having to get top 16 with that bug still being abused
In the latest community feedback they said they addressed many of the edge cases via hotfixes allowing this to happen but to completely resolve they require a for real patch I think to be pushed out From watching streams I m not seeing it happen all the time anymore
Bunny said same thing
This adds quite a few money spots and I ve updated my table but I am sad it s such a small spot considering these players likely would be earning 2 000 in the old Challenger format I am still really happy it s ladder centrist
Awesooome Good luck you ladder heroes
Wow this is big news Basically what people have been asking for hopefully this becomes a regular thing for circuit events
Amazing
This explains why the ladder season end was delayed until February instead of early January Great idea
this is so fucking awesome
For some reason I d like to see it happen for SEA too lol
No SEA region anymore it s part of the America region now
I like that they re region locking the slots to the WCS Winter Championship but I hope that they wouldn t region lock the ladder tournament itself It would encourage players from other regions to play on the ladder and improve competition
This is fucking awesome And people whine towards blizzard that they doesn t do something What the fuck has Valve done for csgo except making skins Blizzard Valve
In contrast Valve has done much for Dota I hear their support for CSGO isn t great though
Ye that can be true But I can totally say that Blizzard supports SC2 more then Valve do with CS GO That is my honest opinion after have been in both games a long time and in a pretty high level in both games
I m looking forward to the drama towards the end when people start accusing eachother of wintrading an sniping
Temp0 time https www youtube com watch v SX1c07mPXqc
I m sure some kinks will need to be worked out but overall I find this to be a fantastic move At the very least aspiring SC2 amateur players have a clearly defined path to walk now to become pros at the game Get top 16 GM
excellent news david kim i forgive u
I forgive him too David Yay
YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Hate to go against CatZ and be negative but I feel this format is bad mainly because of the potential for abuse maphacks win trading etc Even legitimate players against maphackers will change the distribution Just food for thought I think this idea could do with refining
Those are valid concerns it s constructive negativism and it should be discussed I addressed it in my article about Region Lock to a good extend I personally don t think the potential bad is close to out weighting the good in discouraging but not ruling out Barcodes as well as making the NA and EU ladders more active and competitive I think this is fantastic news
Great change hopefully it will bring some new faces players that play on grandmaster level but never played in bigger tournaments into the spotlight
This is fantastic news But I m a little confused at some points of the article Is this only for NA ladder This point For the North American Challenger tournament only residents and citizens of North America Canada U S will be eligible qualify has me confused And then if not is it the top 16 of NA EU combined Will that be the top 8 of each ladder respectively or will they take the ladder points and invite the top 16 in that regard
Yeah wording is terrible They also only mention the residency for NA players Does that mean EU is open to everyone
It says the top 16 players in both regions which clearly means 16 from each region
ABSOLUTE BEST I DEA FREAKING EVARRRRRRRRR SwiftRage
BRINGONTHELADDERHEROES
This is going to be ruined by hackers I hope ESL has a plan in place to be able to weed them out
hackers win trading multiple accounts System is going to be a mess
Blizzard just needs to investigate 16 accounts Should not be to hard to check for this kind of stuff Perma Ban from WCS for cheater Problem solved
more than that Its the top 16 and then those who replace them I mean other ladder qualifying events saw pros win trading in the past Blizzard needs to come down hard on abuse for this They have done some punishment in the past with hearthstone but it doesnt go far enough
A lot of the expected top 16 will I assume be decently be name players at least 10 or so I would guess number coming directly out of my ass I assume they will not cheat due to the damage not been worth it espically when they have other ways to win prize money if for some reason they do not hit top 16 That only really leaves the newer entries of having a serious chance of cheating win trading
A step in the right directon ty blizzard
so if people block gm spots with smurf accounts so better players can t get in this will not work out at all
TB did it before for ShoutCraft and it worked I don t see why it wouldn t work now
There are downsides to this format and people who are already enumerating them are quick to jump the gun when they come true But this hindsight bias is only valid if you got the data to back it up which this experiment will provide
just like i suggested like years ago in a reddit thread pad pad
With proleague 2016 just starting and this kind of news my passion is fully reignited D
Great news
yeeees finally
this is it boys the ladder revamp im already shitting myself
That s pretty cool I imagine that will make top 16 more desirable
citizenship or residency so no koreans
That s the point
This sounds great a bit disheartening that it is only available to select people the entire SEA region being excluded But should make for a definite improvement of ladder quality for those who are at that level
Hey this is pretty cool
At first I just thought well sounds good But on a second thought this should give a really good shot for newcomers and some great streams Good move
This is incredible for many reasons How will they ensure no map hackers abuse this system I have some ideas but I m wondering what everyone thinks
They can t but they did recently make efforts to stop maphacks again and they seem to have some focus on it now
2 They won t
You can t be serious How could they not
You can t be serious How could they even do it
Well I m not sure I was hoping some discussion about options might occur here
How have they stopped maphackers before they haven t But if you maphack at top GM everyone knows who you are and has you friend noted as one so I m fairly sure it ll work just how it always worked in past qualifiers they will notify the tournament admins
I meant that more in a practical way I expect it will be very hard for them to prevent hackers getting through
Oh ok I m also concerned about that Maybe if they focus more anti hacking resources at the top 50 GM players the extra scrutiny can weed out anyone close to the top 16 Plus they could ban the accounts of hackers identified this way and it s pretty time consuming to rank up gain to GM even if it s just 20 30 games
I think it s safe to assume they already pay most attention to top level players it doesn t make a ton of sense rooting out goldy hack claims In the same vein I think it s safe to assume that Blizzard a billion dollar company has much more qualified people who have been working on issues like this for a long time and have more knowledge to apply to this issue than we do
So you think they will be able to deal with the hacker concern ps I hope they can
Haha I super duper hope they can too but I meant that in a more pessimistic way Hacking is tough to root out and as I understand it can t ever really be completely eliminated
The actual top players atleast the ones I know in EU would have way too much to lose for the 400 lets face it if they can t get top 16 legit online without hacks they will never win offline and the ones who aren t legit top pros will get in depth investigation and get ran over and tainted for every single future event Would be smart to enquire for ID before carrying out the investigations in order to ban by Name ID Passport and proceed to roll out the invites as legitimate top 16
To everyone worried about map hackers getting undeserved wins remember map hackers are usually not good enough to compete at this level and map hacking can always occur in any off line tournament so it s not any different than any other tournament In addition hackers will have to play many games on their account to get to a high placement which makes them even more liable to get caught as opposed to being able to practice on a barcode and only having to qualify with a few games on a normal account
Did you actually mean to say map hacking can always occur in any offline tournament That would never be possible
Yeah tell that to Flusha Remember a pro who is really good can still decide to have something like a production tab hack to construct a small advantage for himself to win the game Your argument doesn t make any sense
You know Flusha cheating is a meme right like noone actually thinks he is cheating
Recently a lot of really damning evidence has come to light So no it isn t just a meme anymore
You re full of shit there is no damning evidence unless you seriously think that random youtube videos showing CLEAR OMG NOT CLICKBAIT FLUSHA AIMLOCK1 1 are evidence
You clearly are not up to date or haven t digged hard enough
Latin America has the Copa America 40 000 tournament which does the same thing as this tournament only with more money and less players
How can it start today if GM isn t even open
Well they only check the top players when the time period ends whenever it officially starts makes no difference
This is exactly what is needed Good job all round
is the event online and is it top16 each server plays eachother or is all 32 players in and only top16 payout
It will be online and each region plays themselves so EU and NA won t face each other
Ladder matters this is so cool
This seems like a great idea
About time Just hope they fix the game ready bug because that will cause shittons of problems
So how well does the ladder work to decide the top 16 players of a region
don t know how well it works but I would still prefer a ladder on which you will be supposed to play lots of games to achieve top 16 which btw will become even more demanding than now with all the ladder heroes unchained in grinding thousand of games to make it than a fistful bo3s played online being exposed to most of the ladder related issues production tabs smurfs etc plus most of the guys that are indeed active on the ladder have a certain clue who the better players are so should some cheater maphacker nonamer make it to the top 16 that would put an insane pressure on Blizz shoulders to disqualify them or atleast to fix the cheats hacks better than they do currently
Why does COPA america get 40 000 but EU and NA only get 10000
Copa America already existed had it s own sponsors and it s prize pool didn t get more money between 2015 and 2016 The NA and EU Challenger is an all new competition I am sad it s such a small pool since even the winner of the tournament gets less than an old Challenger spot but better than nothing
What happens if one person has two IDs in a pay out spot
Well considering you ll have to compete for the money I think they ll notice if you have two accounts when you might have to play yourself
This sounds awesome I also believe it s one small step forward to solving the barcode problem by requiring the players to register with their real ID in order to participate in this ladder Challenger
Does anyone know if other games csgo dota lol have a similar system and if so about how they deal with hacking
I can only speak of CS GO But CS GO has the worst matchmaking ever so many cheaters and it s pretty easy to be global elite highest rank after that it s no point in playing MM So all the serious players in csgo play faceit esea etc
So having tournaments decided by matchmaking wouldn t be considered in csgo I guess
It shouldn t be like that with SC2 With hacking so common there are clans for cheaters to trade their programs I would not be surprised if we see names like Sentinel iLLest Krr and Drusus competing in NA or one of those European hackers with the name of a controversial American politician This sounds like a downsizing thing so they don t have to go through a million people that sign up
Dota runs open quals for all majors They have needed to deal with hacking for whatever reasons Worst that s ever happened is stream cheating
I m going to start the over under at 3 5 confirmed maphackers any takers
Just how GM is not an option since you can t get into GM when it is full If they want to select the top players based on their MMR at season start then it will always be debatable without a single combined master league
Does it go by points or MMR And not to be negative nancy but how do we know that the people picked for MMR is correct when we can t see it MMR should be the value people are picked by not points Because if someone starts late and doesn t get into GM since it s closed RIP that dude
Win trading hacking multiple accounts The ladder isnt going to work for this system Over under on how many people in the top 16 are going to get dq d
Blizzard ESL is not listening Kappa
Hate to go against CatZ and be negative but I feel this format is bad mainly because of the potential for abuse maphacks win trading etc Even legitimate players against maphackers will change the distribution Just food for thought I think this idea could do with refining
ugh Like I love the counter strike community but that was such an ignorant comment who is that guy anyway
Actually has been lol SKT vs KT finals PartinG vs Life finals etc etc
This needed a thread

Yeh same that moment when I m baneling busting and he nades my banelings over the wall xD
I m so happy BaseTrade is irrelevant right now I wish another group of casters would come in their stead
How has nobody mentioned Idra and his literall boot from EG
My thought exactly
Like he s got 9k viewers now but he s mostly speaking english and korean I think you re right but don t chinese people use twitch too I may be mistaken
I ve shown this post to DK and he s working on a patch to give Ravagers a speed buff and wings to fly Brood Lords will also now have the ability to shoot fungal growth with the same range as their Brood Lings Good job muh mang without you we wouldn t have a safe StarCraft to play

Salty https www reddit com r AllThingsTerran comments 3x72az for those who went from diamond to masters after
I don t really care at this point You couldn t kill my passion for starcraft unless you killed me Match fixing doesn t scare me away
Seriously I enjoy watching Starcraft so godamnit that s what I do
I have tried watching other games from time to time to broaden my horizons It doesn t work CS is a fun game dont have time for it SC eats up all my game time but i also find it difficult to watch Dota is the closest game i could also watch but i don t understand it I get the broad concepts just too many details i don t know about Starcraft for me is a perfect game to play and a perfect game to watch
Not trying to not make you watch starcraft with this idea but you should try watching fighting games The 1v1 aspect of them really connected to me from a starcraft perspective when I started looking at that scene They also share some similar storylines Long history before the rebirth of modern Esport Broodwar days vs arcade days the rivalry between Asia and western countries for capcom games atleast and the idea of legendary players bonjwa vs the 5 Gods of Japan
Yep I love watching playing Smash Melee
1 to Melee I used to play so many games before college As an adult now Melee and Starcraft are pretty much all I have time to play and all I actually want to play
totally agree i just love watching street fighter probably because of how diverse the personalities are in the FGC
The only physical sports i watch is Tennis Boxing if its a big fight MMA if i have the change and Snooker Street Fighter sounds great Easy to watch simple concept but intricate reaction based
Agreed Smash is my second favourite game to watch Armada fo lyfe
I have found great enjoyment recently in watching fighting games Can t take that marvel vs capcom anime stuff cannot tell what is going on but street fighter or netherrealm games are awesome for me to watch Basically they share the strategy and realtime execution element with SC2 and the merciless 1v1 competition And you have those epic moments of this dude is a god which I don t normally get with other Esports than SC2 Trying to play MKX I can confirm that the barrier of entry is as high as SC2 though out of the 20 games I played I won 1

Fuck yeah dude Long live sc2
Its true im old school though I played this game the first day it came out SC1 vanilla There was no scene and no tournaments Our love for the game comes from the game itself not from tournaments or internet popularity And their are millions others just like us
Pretty much this
If I could handle the god damned maestro being involved in match fixing I ll get over this no doubt
The only thing that could take my love and respect for the korean competitive scene is if matchfixing wasn t properly punished If somehow people were hyped to see Yoda streaming or being allowed back into tournaments that s when I would lose the respect of the competitive game
Don t let a few people spoil your fun If those players come back ignore them and don t give them either attention or money Support people who deserve your support
I totally agree with you In CS GO a professional team match fixed and because they also are famous streamers everyone wants them to come back to the competitive scene Tbh that look so bad for the cs go scene tbh Hope the same thing doesnt happen to sc2
No the reason that people want them to come back is because there were no rules against it I think it is kind of fucked up that they are the first huge names for this to happen that they deserve lifetime bans
The people susceptible of losing their passion because of this have already quit the boat a long time ago SC2 today s fans left are the hardcore fans who will always remains fans no matter what
I wonder what he meant when he said they had a hard time with SKT
It means SKT didn t to want to sponsor Pro League
No he is just acknowledging the fact that SKT is the main sponsor of Pro League 2016 and that their support was instrumental in keeping the tournament going
My life for StarCraft
Let s fight this Starcraft is too good a game it is worth it
Even though I m new I love StarCraft and I shall stay here until the last professional SC2 game is played
Fuck yeah
The attitude change in this thread from just little over a day ago is so great I can hardly believe it Lets keep it up upvote good upvote bad discuss good discuss bad rejoice good and cry bad but always move forward
To be fair your honest rant that was posted a bit ago was really eye opening for a lot of people myself included I hope we can keep this up because Starcraft truly is the greatest game
Neuro
KEEP FIGHTING
I think you give too much credit to the immature naysayers Remember that most starcraft fans are typically older more reserved adults who have 8 10 hours exhausting day jobs We are the ones supporting starcraft with our wallets We may not write much here but we will always be your loyal fans
Wasn t sure if I wanted to sub to the proleague channel because I am a poor college student but fuck it I want to support them and don t want to see proleague die
I think we should all strive to do our best to be a positive part of the community This doesn t mean we need to be naive about the current situation of the scene but negativity just becomes a downward spiral that achieves nothing other than harming the game more
This is a natural consequence of being able to make better money gambling on SC2 than playing it You can say what you want about Life making the most money and thus not needing it but if the allegations end up being true you can bet your dick that plenty of B teamers were in on it as well Imagine doing well in minor tournaments and making a few hundred bucks while people make thousands off gambling on your match That doesn t excuse the behaviour of any individual at all but when you put a large number of people in that situation it really is not surprising that some will break
Remeber when Blizzard fought tooth and nail against KeSPA for the control of Korean SC2 When Blizzard thought they were going to profit Now look what happened KeSPA left holding up the scene themselves and what did Blizz do
Blizzard doesn t care about the ultimate fate of StarCraft in Korea They only cared enough about the short term profits of selling SC2 when it was new e Sport scene be damned to make it happen This is the result less tournaments than ever before the smallest Proleague than ever before fewer more reluctant sponsors the fewest amount of teams We ll see where the scene ends up in a year or two
I can t tell for sure if Blizzard cares probably there is already enough misinformed speculation on the topic but I guess KeSPA wasn t that reluctant to control the korean scene there was a lot of economical interest involved and from great powers come also responsabilities It is the same KeSPA that for example prevented PartinG from playing PL matches last year stripping PL of a big role model and damaging his team I m afraid region locks and WCS would have hurt korean SC still way less than the present scandal can do
It s sad this is the state of SC2 coming off the last expansion of the game Suppose to be the penultimate experience for Starcraft and yet it failed to generate any hype I seriously doubt Blizzard made much money from HotS and LotV and they have nobody to blame but themselves
Time to start setting alarms to wake up so I can watch all of proleague
You will poorly always have matchfixing in any Sport We can always just continue and have fun with what we love and there is no reason not to do that My life for Aiur
That s not true and definitely not at the highest level
Well Life was for a looooong time at the highest level not sure when that changed
Highest level in SC2 means his making a fraction of highest level in another sport You couldn t have match fixing in a sport where the players are making 5 million a year It s why gambling used to be such a big problem for American sports see 1919 world series and isn t an issue at all currently The players just make to much for them to be bought by match fixers
Yea youre right For some reason i mssed up what i wanted to say My statement was meant more torwards generally cheating or changing the expected outcome not necessarily matchfixing
You said we will always have matchfixing in any Sport I said that is a bullshit claim because it is not the case especially not at the highest level Which is what happened here with Life
Please ignore that corrupted 1 and protect the passion of 99 BibleThump
So it sounds like SK Telecom was reluctant to continue their sponsorship of proleague because of alleged matchfixing by Life Just shows how much damage matchfixing can do to a fragile scene If he gets convicted he s dead to me I dont care fucking up so many honest people livelyhood and passion
The life news just came a couple of days ago and proleague had already been delayed for quite a while I think its more likely that SKT was just hesitant to put too much more money into the SC2 scene generally before the matchfixing came out
no I highly doubt they would have sponsored it now after the Life scandal Its much more likely that SKT just didnt see the sponsorship with the money
lmao I m sure Life right now is thinking ohh no please WarMooner don t let me dead to you nobody cares
My passion is always intact if not constantly rising matchfixing is a sad occurrence but it will take much more than that to damage my interest
Honestly the Western audience seem to severly overestimate the role of KESPA They don t have half the power or resource some people blindly assume they have
dunno how it works in most countries but in Italy sport federations have very little power on that they can acquire documentation from state persecutors and run their own trials judgements but not much more than that Should their verdicts be overruled by the ones of state s tribunals they may even be compelled to cancel their sentencies Federations are limited both by the law privacy laws civil rights etc and by lack of financial means to pursue suspects and run independent investigations they almost totally rely on national persecutors but a standard trial takes ages to arrive at the final judjgement so sports are often found to be run sub judice We ve been having huge match fixing scandals in soccer in the last years that are making our league a sub par joke on the international scene still the Federation seems completely helpless and lacks independence If I had my way for our experience so far I would make betting completely illegal as it was when I was a kid and the only kinda betting allowed was a state monopoly
Isn t it more like the NFL or Olympic committee works in tandem with the government
It pretty much is exactly that Its more of a comitee than anything else with ties to with government
matchfixing is no joke
Regardless of what happens I will still love this game and the scene
Too bloody dramatic for me mate ban the cunt and continue business as usual There will always be people that want to make money via illegal means
DeMusliM and FireCake on the same team now that s a thing I never predicted to happen in StarCraft II D
Oh really haha after all those times Demuslim talked about him on stream while Firecake built 9 hatches all over the map and went afk I would have never expected this
can u link me to one of the vods for this
what next Naniwa and Polt in a archon mode tournament as a team
Nani and Nestea
Never forget
People tend to change their minds when money is involved
Demuslim keeps getting them checks incredible Such a limited player
He is still one of the most popular streamers which is worth more than mediocre tournament placements Over 5 years latter and people still don t realize foreign teams are just advertising packages Tournament placements are only tangentially related to a players worth
I think anyone who has seen EG must know it to be truth It s just that it s hard to cheer for a player who doesn t accomplish
He s really improved a lot over the last few months and honestly being on a team with those two will most likely enhance his play Fire cake for as annoying as he has been before is a very innovative and creative player and being on a team with Demu should really help him
I think people severely overestimate how much people on the same team play customs together
Foreign teams are just collective sponsorships Team is a loose term
For real Being on the same team won t magically make them buddy buddy they re both independently repping the same sponsors that s all
So the team has Nerchio Firecake and Demu Doesn t Demuslim dislike the other two I thought for sure I remember him having words with Firecake at least Regardless Grats to Demu and everyone on Euronics The best way to resolve beef is to hop in a skype call and shoot the shit
It seemed like when Demu was talking about it on stream he selected those two to be on the team Possibly he is mature enough to separate his personal feelings towards someone and business
starcraft is serious bidness yo
For these players Yes yes it is
so is fries
A team with Firecake Nerchio Demuslim in the line up i m officially a fan i want that Euronics gaming flair asap
Sounds like we need some Euronics Flair around here Grats Ben and Euronics
Feels good to see a new team investing in sc2
from EG DeMusliM to EG DeMuslim
ESG DeMuslim
I m really hopeful to see demuslim competing regularly Also great to see Euronics supporting players Alot of teams been coming and going quickly Heres to hoping Euronics stays for a while
If EG couldnt get demuslim to sign up for tournaments on time what hope does euronics have
Now they even have a professional streamer
Who streams twice a week what a remarkable investment
I remember when Demu streamed all the time or it seemed like it He was so engaging with his audience and would often comment as to what he would try to do and how why he was trying to do it I fucking loved his stream Then around the time he lost to an unknown zerg by letting them restart after building a Evo Chamber instead of a spawning pool he changed He went on to do poorly in the next couple lans and then came on his stream and said he would be streaming less Shortly after that I lost interest in SC2 and moved on to other games EDIT Downvoted cause Demu was part of the reason I held on to this game as long as I did
Scarlett was pretty unknown at the time at least compared to demuslim He said he lost interest in SC2 after that it is possible this was before she started really stomping face
Ha ha I know Demu was just really bummed after that series and wondered if he should have restarted the game in the first place I do remember loving this game up until early HotS I guess people here don t like talking about people moving on and honestly I don t blame them
Doesn t Demu hate Firecake even more than most people
It s not like being on a team together will change their interactions at all Their not gonna start playing custom games together cause they have the same sponsors since sponsors is all foreign teams are
Team leagues will be awkward af
Nice In many ways I find this team one of the most interesting ones out there
Yay Benjamin
awesome It is pretty funny to think back to Firecake trolling Demu by placing hatches all over the map then asking for a pause and going AFK and now they are on the same team lol
I look forward to seeing him play in the SC2ITL
Can t remember what tournament he played recently but he actually was playing pretty well Like pretty good Macro and such
Homestory Cup
deleted
He has a relatively big fanbase a popular and entertaining stream and a well recognized name Ranking isn t everything a team is looking for Also I m not sure about his current rank but he was top 20 EU not that long ago
Can t remember what tournament he played recently but he actually was playing pretty well Like pretty good Macro and such
Homestory Cup
Where he won 2 1 over Scarlett
Did t he also lose to WhiteRA though That s like being wrestled to the ground by your grandfather
WhiteRa is a young man in his 30s not a grandfather
White Ra isn t that old That said it would be like getting beaten by Mr Miyagi if he was old
euronics really are trying their best to create a team of douchebags
It s actually not that bad of a strategy as long as they make sure the bants don t to go to far I can see that being a thing for EURONICS The Bants Squad Might get them a lot of attention and exposure But it has to be clever bants not just low tier BM ToD should join also
But they have no Protoss so far p
Now they need to sign Naniwa Kappa
jesus they should hire kealaris ahahahahha
Anyone know if the ladder lowers your rank every season like LoL does I ve played nearly every season of SC2 but honestly don t really remember Example You were Plat 1 in LoL and go 5 5 in your placements It places you in gold 3 because it s nearly impossible to get placed where you were before unless your mmr was a lot higher than your league at the end of the season
You will often but not always be placed a league lower than you were the previous season though to be fair there are no demotions during season now so it s not clear if your MMR has gone down or if they just want to place you lower Usually by playing a couple of games and seeing if you get promoted again quick will answer that question Blizzard also has promised to eventually show true MMR which will help answer a lot of questions about he ladder
I forgot you couldn t be demoted Is there still MMR decay I feel like there was at one point wasn t there
No that was taken out April of last year
Yes I believe thats still in the game but only applies if you don t play for something like 2 weeks
Crap Time to grind
I could be wrong but I m pretty sure there isn t Instead there s a bonus pool which basically gives extra points or a shield to the people who DO play So basically instead of demoting players who don t play it promotes people who do play
Bonus pool has no effect on league or MMR MMR decay is a completely different thing and definitely exists or at least existed 1 2 3
Removed last year during the ladder rebalance
It would be really nice if Blizzard did so do you have a source
They discussed this in the multiplayer panel at blizzcon by quick googling I found this which says they want to make the ladder system more accurate and transparent Somewhere they also said about combining masters and gm and showing true mmr for at least top players
Thx
I got promoted from this season it was nice
literally the same as the last season theres zero point of making a blog post about this Hey guys The sky is now blue today
so people know that a new season has begun
Not everyone plays every In fact it seems like more then half of the people that come here don t play at all I bet this was news to more people then you d think
Check this sub everyday Play everyday
Sky is gray for me C
So no new maps I hate to be another negative Nelly but what the hell are Blizzard doing It would take one employees one work day to round up 4 or 5 new maps made by the community I really don t think I can bring myself to play another season of these pretty bad maps
I m pretty sure having one guy pick a couple maps one day without thorough testing a FAR worse idea then leaving the map pool static Just pointing out that you are wrong
Well there s a few things with your comment that I can pick apart Firstly there are some fantastic map makers out there making maps for tournaments GSL S2L ProLeague that I can guarantee you put their maps through much more extensive testing than Blizzard do Secondly even if there was one or two issues with the maps I would find that much more acceptable than playing the same dull and boring maps for another full season So your statement of it being a FAR worse idea can really only be applied to the fact that the maps MIGHT not be as thoroughly tested and not to whether it would be more fun or not Lastly my opinion is just that my opinion Because you disagree it doesn t make it wrong But thanks for your input
Any map that gets chosen has to go through and be stripped of like 90 of the doodads and water so it can be played on potato PCs and then tested on potato PCs to make sure they took out enough doodads It s quite a bit more than a single day of work by one person
Non of that maters If blizzard just picked maps they thought would be good without thorough testing and a major issue was found no mater how unlikley they would be slaughter by this community You know better
It is demoralizing to have to play on either dusk towers or a shitty map All of the other 2 players maps are just terrible and 4 player maps lead to stupid RNG with scouting and early pressure Sigh
I like orbital shipyard too And 4 player maps always have an RNG element it s been true as long as there have been 4 player maps so since sc1 was released Just something you have to play around like literally everything else on a given map
I liked it at first too but there s just too many things wrong with it Crazy reaper play in base natural crazy drop perimeter crazy liberator spots ridiculously difficult fourth It s still the second best map IMO which is sad RE 4 player maps Yes it s something that you need to play around and yes its been that way forever Doesn t mean it s a good thing though Sometimes you send a scout out they die before getting any good info and then you just lose Shit like that shouldn t happen in a strategy game Scouting should be a calculated risk not a calculated risk the roll of the RNG
If your scout doesn t see anything just open safe Your opponent has the same dice roll you do If you want a completely RNG free strategy game there are plenty of other options for you Never have I just lost because my scout didn t see enough I have just lost because my scout didn t see anything I played like shit This I hate 4 player maps is some bronze tier whining
PvT Send a scout out after gateway this was HOTS Guess wrong when I get to the guys base theres 2 marines guarding his expo and my scout dies Less than a minute later 10 marines show up with scv support for an all in and I get completely crushed Literally nothing I could have done differently and I lost because of randomness PS im diamond and whining about 4 player maps is not a bronze thing you dumbass
I was masters p in WoL and HotS I guess you just played better players than I did
Wow so condescending and not even addressing my point what a piece of shit
Sorry here Scout last scout gets denied what do Assuming you re P and the marines stopped you from seeing up the big ramp to see if they had a natural CC Hallucinate a phoenix to see if there s an all in coming If you don t like that send your first stalker or pair of stalkers across the map just don t lose it them With good micro you can bleed them of a few units just don t get surrounded by the SCV train Position forces appropriately use a safe build that gets MSC out on time 10 marine SCV all in happens very strong all in vs 1 gate expo builds regardless if scouted or not use FFs plus nexus cannon to defend Warp in more zealots than you think you need I ve lost to this build even after scouting it defending comes down to FF placement on your big ramp and not letting them bait out nexus cannon without being FFed in and losing some units You didn t lose because of randomness you lost because you didn t know how to react to the limited information I always assume the worst possible thing is happening until I scout otherwise I also lost games because I play too safe and not greedy enough but this is why I was masters and not GM As a P you always have the option of paying 100 sentry energy to scout Less common to have so many sentries in legacy but some korean pros are bringing back the mass sentries
Still no news about the HotS maps I haven t bought LotV yet because I don t like some things about it and so I m stuck with terrible maps for HotS Why don t they make the best maps to be the permanent maps like they did with WoL EDIT Downvotes for saying why I don t like the maps in the game version I play in a thread talking about a new season
I don t even think they plan on changing them anymore I could be wrong but I think that once lotv hit HotS has just lost support as is expected
Keeping the old maps would be completely fine if they did some kind of voting like with WoL IIRC I wasn t playing SC at the time but I heard something like that correct me if I m wrong It really isn t a huge effort to update the maps They basically say fuck you if you don t upgrade you don t get the same experience as when you purchased the game
There was no vote The maps from the last season stayed The game is done with and there are newer versions there s really no reason to keep updating the older ones
I understand why they wouldn t update balance but still many players are playing WoL and HotS Updating maps isn t a huge effort It s a corporate bullshit to make players buy the new version even if they don t enjoy it that much
I mean yeah you should expect that Updating the maps is probably more of an effort than you think it takes them considering how long it takes them to do anything map related in the current version of the game too
In Brood War the community could make its own maps to keep the game fresh It wouldn t be very hard to implement some kind of voting system for WoL and HotS ladder maps or to have a designated community spokesperson be in charge of it But yeah that s not in Blizzard s financial interest
It can t be that hard I know some issues can be hard to fix but this one really isn t They were doing this for many years this is their job What current issues are you referring to There were no problems on changing maps as far as I know
I would love to see a change in the HotS mappool but how do you think it should be done A voting from the community to make a map pool or reverting to an older season mappool As mentioned before I think it s unlikely that Blizzard will respond to this subject Whereas I own LotV but rather play HotS Instead I mostly play WoL because of the HotS mappool
Allow people from the community to apply to become community representatives to manage the map pool Let the community vote on them Blizzard can make the final decision These designated community members are then in charge of updating the map pool at their own discretion Allow everyone to vote for the maps in the map pool before the start of every season The maps to choose from would be all of the maps from all previous seasons map pools
They did a voting with WoL too IIRC I don t see why they can t do it here It seems to me like the forgot about it If it s some company policy to abandon the old and make players buy the new one even if they prefer the old that is quite sad
The current WoL mappool is was the same in 2013 which sadly does not look good for HotS http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Maps Ladder Maps Wings of Liberty
so when does gm start
In one week as always
Oh boy can t wait to not get in once again
Come watch http www twitch tv sc2proleague
DownWithDin oh wait
lol
I actually just randomly started to watch last years championship can someone explain the rules to me as far as i know unless all your nexus command centers hives drones scvs probes die Your still in it But these matches end completely random Atleast to me When the loser still has three bases i dont get it Eli5
Players will concede if they know they are too far behind to mount any sort of effective defense offense Your opponents entire army is in your base and you have no units to defend it s better to just concede instead of making them destroy every last building
Ok That makes since I guess in my non pro eyes it seems weird Ill just stick to my campaign and cheat codes and just enjoy the game I always got rekt lanning with my family so makes since Thanks for the logical information that i couldn t comprehend until guided to it like a child
I m surprised you have none of this information since you ve played the game with other people before
I only played with my family When i was in my teens And my family are assholes so my uncle who had a way better understanding of the game Would zerg rush me with 6 lings within minutes of the game and destroy my base and laugh his ass off while i was just trying to collect minerals I always loved protoss Mostly because i enjoyed playing by myself and you could build a base for all races in one scrimmage But when attacked i always tried to get a probe out and go hide and try to start a new base I love RTS games but ill never claim to be really good at them
Watch more pro matches learn how to play from them challenge your uncle and then defeat him
Haha that s funny Was it SC1 you were playing Part of why I got really interested in pro SC2 was that I had really fond memories of the older title Welcome to the sub
what a jerk
Players leave when they know they can t come back from critical damage Like if a massive army rolls over your massive army and you have 150 units less having four bases means nothing so they just leave the game because they won t come back
It is actually considered slightly bad manners if you run around the map trying to live when there is no way to actually win Like say floating all your buildings into nooks and crannys on the map or making half built supply depots everywhere so the game won t end
People have explained the answer but just FYI the real victory condition is destroying all of your opponents buildings workers don t have anything to do with it
is it just me or is the twitch stream not working azubu buffering horribly Edit azubu works fine now
I thought I was the only one Livestreamer works great though
Didn t work for me until I reduced the quality from Source to Medium and reloaded Chat was saying it s something to do with Source quality being subscriber only
thx for this hint for me it works with HIGH qualitiy as well me being a non subscriber
it s not working for me too in chrome but in firefox works just fine
mm twitch didnt work for me either but found azubu
Not working for me also BibleThump
The twitch stream isn t working for me All i m getting is a black screen with the spinning loading circle forever Is it working for anyone else
set stream quality to medium and then reload and switch to high its because source is subscribers only
you re the real MVP thanks
Wow thanks it worked Normally the stream just loads up with whatever quality is allowed
Great games so far and i enjoy the casting but please let us see the ingame time
Yes please I agree as well though really fun games
Sadly not happening with all the illegal gambling in Korea
Can you expound on this about the game clock
There was talk around July that illegal bets based on the in game clock no unit dies in first five minutes etc have become quite popular so KeSPA responded by removing the clock from view This removes the unambiguous timing method from the gamblers and pretty much eliminates such bets
Ahh okay gotcha thanks
Anyone know the VOD policy Says it s only available for subscribers on Twitch Will they unlock and or put the games up on Youtube as usual
See this comment https www reddit com r starcraft comments 43not9 2016 starcraft 2 proleague is officially under czjnb4f
Protoss protoss protoss Glad they re still doing well after the adept nerf First time watching pvp when it is disruptor vs disruptor I thought zest was for sure gonna win But damn did he blink at the wrong times that allowed dear to hit MONEY disruptor shots Everytime they go off tasteless and his cocastor just scream It was every entertaining I can see how it can be a pain to play tho lol Edit serious about the glad they re doing well part I was expecting toss to be incredibly weak vs terran based on feedback I ve seen Glad it wasn t necessarily the case
http www azubu tv EN SC2 Proleague If anyone wants to watch english version without waiting for the VOD twitch is subs only for watching the past highlight just click vods on the right side of the screen and pick the most recent one
Look like Twitch VODs are locked behind subscriber pay wall anyone knows where to find English VODs
Usually uploaded here a few hours after they are played https www youtube com user ESportsTV videos
Thanks
If the twitch stream is not working Change quality to high Refresh Press play button to stop and press it again

man you gotta get with the TeamLiquid times
6 years too late
i am the only one who can t watch it stream loads forever only this stream
Anyone know if the vods will be available Twitch vods are for subscribers only apparently
man I got watch the vods when I get back
Where can you watch proleague
HYPEEEEEEEEEEE
HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPE
If you compare these games with last DH this is on another planet
Match prepared week s before against a Tournament
And for me and seemingly many others the DH was more exciting seeing the numbers But anyway Good to see some enjoy it
Proleague is always good What s your point
that DH sucked
I had fun
What sucked about it I enjoyed it a lot
Well how nice of reddit to downvote for expressing my opinion I didn t really like it the games I watched admittedly not all was sub par compare to IEM for example
Lol its reddit people get down voted for the most random reason or no reason
Why must you be so negative Yes Proleague was great I also think Dreamhack was great Why do you have to say that one thing is shitty in order to say that one thing is enjoyable That s just useless negativity
I m at work SO I CANT GET HYPED
In light of the recent WCS Challenger League announcement maybe we could take a closer look at some of the ladder bugs See how I didn t sound like a frustrated little douchebag You should try it sometimes
I think everyone who gets this bug can understand the frustration though We know that the bug occured after it says 5 seconds Game Ready but the error message appears after one and a half MINUTES So it s even faster to relog They could at least fix this and people shouldn t lose ladder points due to this bug I don t think it s too hard to implement this
Yeah I ve just started playing on NA with 150 ping because I don t get it there I gave up hope it would be fixed a good while ago
But this is reddit we re supposed to be edgy right
But you wouldn t get upvotes
If you had to deal with that ladder for 2 months as well you might be as frustrated as we are Game ready bug having to play trash because of leave league abusers the maps etc
I didn t have to deal with it because I never got the game ready bug in 300 games and all I felt like vetoing was Central and Prion I m not saying it s not a problem but you re not helping yourself
Many people DO have the problem though and the people in GM cannot get to high ranks with the game ready bug it s literally not possible in a lot of peoples cases
Posting a sarcastic tweet is a pretty useless way to complain At least try tweeting at a blizz account
you mean like this https twitter com SC2ShoWTimE status 681800473326841856 Helped a lot as you can see Also I dont really care about it too much since I m already qualified
That s step one Step two is wording it in a way that won t get you immediately written off as just another complainer
Already did that in battle net forums and via support tickets They didnt even bother to respond or didnt have a clue either Being nice and friendly isnt always helping you in this world you know especially when it s blizzard
All my experiences show me that the disgruntled customer is the one who gets the most attention
Trust me you got owned
Because that s what discussion is about
Well there s not much more to do then They ll probably get around to it eventually but yeah it sucks to have to deal with the bug in the meantime
Yes to be honest you re a fantastic player and seem like an overall nice dude But Blizz gets a lot of crap and all players and those big in the community should try to be role models Everyone rioted about the season end date being extended from Jan 1 and look clearly there was a cool idea and a plan behind it Best of luck in your games big fan of you as a player sorry if I m coming across as an asshole just meant to be constructive
It s all good Just a bit annoyed about people thinking I m only complaining on twitter about it without having tried to solve the issue
I have the same bug and I understand your frustration especially since you are competing and it really feel like you have a handicap with this I was using WTFast and the bug was no more but I can t afford their expensive vpn so 14 days and back to the bug
Pretty sure this is to just vent not actually fix the problem Problem will be fixed early in the second half of the year
GM isn t even open yet
gm always opens 1 week after the season started which is before 12 feb everybody knows that your comment is completely useless he is losing pts from the game ready bug hence the tweet
Fixed 10 months ago it would appear https www reddit com r starcraft comments 2yk25t game is ready fix As this was mentioned in a response to his tweet about 6 hours ago not sure why this was posted to reddit o O https twitter com Poofsc status 694240489143455744
another day another huk complaint
wrong white guy
HuK o o
Hu wai what
removed
Don t forget to downvote the thread newcomers hate such negativity
Seems it isn t just reddit that can be a little emo sometimes Oh well SC2 is still a great game
I had the bug too none of the suggested fixes helped I tried switching regions and I don t get the bug when playing on NA so maybe try that out of you tried everything else
Nerf Toss
I haven t played sc2 in a while uh Game looks slightly different
Don t worry this was just a small rebalance patch See Overlords can scout Supply Depots can be raised and lowered and now Pylons can fuck shit up
But overlords always could scout c buff overlords pls
Now they can viably drop
Let me catch you up to speed The mothership was really op so they gave Terran a planetary core and Zerg a broodmother core Then protoss was balanced which made Dustin Browder mad so now you have this
I still don t quite get it Why is it releasing pylons like a carrier
Someone just replaced the models of the carrier interceptors with MSCore and pylons
Dustin Browder has a problem when protoss isn t the strongest race A mothership core for every race angered our vengeful balance god Thus this incarnation of the mothership core was created The carrier core costs 100 100 and comes with 6 attacking pylons all which grant regular power and supply However pylon overcharge now costs 75 so we ll see how that nerf plays into the meta
I get that this is the joke but like what actually motivated this satire How did they buff protoss
they didnt we got 2 nerfs in the most recent patch
BUT With the reduction in power to MSC and photon overcharge now maybe they can actually look at giving proper buffs to other less used units and allowing protoss players a more diverse unit composition in different match ups at least thats my hope
I feel like all I am using right now is Zealot Archon blink Stalker Disruptor or Zealot Immo Archon Like what the heck man QQ Seriously though I feel like I have very little options
Blizzard thought protoss were too weak because they had to energise an area before building Killing a pylon denied toss building space So any pylons built have infinite energy field range and are stored in projectile firing units Open up the game and build a stalker you ll see it fires pylons too
DK admitted that Terran was slightly underpowered at the end of HOTS and that protoss was slightly OP so to balance this DK now made it so pylons can shoot and also nerfed marauders Game now balanced yay
David Kim This kind of criticism doesn t help
There is some truth to every positive and negative comment Mothership core is a band aid unit and is ruining the game at least in all PvX matchups anyway
Why though I agree that pylon cannons needed a nerf and chuckled at this post but there s been much hate for the Mothership Core long before LotV Is there a convincing argument for removing the unit Or am I just humorless and missing the joke behind the anti MSC circle jerk
The mothership is literally the one and only thing carrying protoss into the late game It prevents any sort of early game harass efficiently it buys time etc etc etc MEANWHILE protoss armies cannot stand on their own vs bio terran or hordes of zerg units Just imagine how consistent and good protoss army units would be if the mothership core would be scrapped
That s not true I often go two gate two gas for fast tech usually forge with Stargate Robo behind early game poking with adepts if going Stargate and stalkers if going Robo Expand build more production facilities and upgrade into the late game I often skip the MSC until the mid game for mass recall after my push especially against a fast zerg army or even late game for Mothership stealth
That s not true I often make statements asserting the absolute truth and everyone else is wrong I do this because I like being right all the time and I can t live in a world where other people have different opinions than my own bwah bwah bwahbwah bwah
You said that the MSC is the one and only thing carrying Protoss into the late game That s you re opinion I shared mine that the unit is not necessary You don t have to resort to BM because you disagree In fact you might ve convinced me to agree with you if you actually supported your claim in a rebuttal but I guess you d rather attack me as an individual ad Hominem than my argument as a point of debate This reflexive BM upchucking is exactly what David Kim is calling not constructive
I guess you didn t catch the message I Don t Care
So brave
Brave level so
Idk Would a terran army be better and more consistent without bunkers and repair Or would it just be unbalance able Defenders advantage is important and having things a macro player can put money into to allow them to hold off aggression and harass make the race less extreme as in either all in or turtling So I don t know if I agree with your statement I mean overcharge was made significantly more dynamic in lotv say what you want about it being OP last patch as in the limited range duration and pylon health makes counter play with harassment exist Looking at things like ravagers popping pylon cyclones and tanks outranging and killing them baiting them out and general increased strength of multiprong aggression due to the lower coverage area see speedling drops and lib harass and what not So the same argument of just cast an overcharge and the base is safe that kind existed in hots isn t quite the same These limitations will be much more obvious after the last patch and the strength of it was nerfed and frankly the original strength of lotv overcharge is probably a large reason people seem to miss the design change implications So is just removing the mothership core a reasonable suggestion No not really Is the mothership core the best solution to the issues toss had in WoL maybe maybe not The current version of the core is a strict improvement design wise from the original so that was blizzards way of addressing the hots bandaid fix Best solution who knows improvement yes for sure
Terran is based around have one main unit that can be upgraded stim shield and supported by other units medivacs marauders widow mines Mech is also doable since terran can turtle very easily that s the lore design of Terran Terran s get bunkers that you fill with army units Zergs get creep speed boost for lings roach and queens so army units Protoss gets mothership core and pylons Army units Nah Why is it that Terran and Zerg must rely on units best defense is a good offense where Protoss must rely on photon overcharge and well positioned pylons that deal massive damage in a large area and buys time for them to tech and make lots of gateways stargates safely and eventually build an actual army This isn t enjoyable Just like how Zergs cant do shit vs mass reaper unless Terran s fuck up or mass adept into mass pheonix harass unless Protoss fucks up the Mothership core allows a certain invulnerability to Protoss for much of the early game With energy and available pylons So essentially for free Again that is not enjoyable to play against I love macro games but not when its forced into it because that is how the game is currently designed edit and to answer you re question if we removed the mothership core photon overcharge redesigning gateway units to be viable and consistent in their application whether through better stats or movement speed or whatever One of the things this reminds me of is the implementation of the Shield Battery in StarCraft I What does the Shield Battery do It replenishes shields lost from units What a great idea why did SC2 get the mothership core when the shield battery could do the same job but even better It s like a pseudo bunker medivac for protoss AND NOT ONLY THAT FOLKS it forces protoss to not mass pylons and stack up energy on their mothership core It forces protoss to make ARMY UNITS and DEFEND with them while microing the shit out of the battery shield to ensure units dont take hull damage Could you imagine In this situation there is a chance that an attacker could break through or that the protoss can defend or there could be a stalemate There is action and suspense and thrill Anything can fucking happen Anything Now come back to real life You have a mothership core and pylons Congrats you just entered the mid game Blizzard removed a ton of great ideas from the original StarCraft when SC2 was released in 2010 Unfortunately But we learned to love the reaper the immortal the old one and banelings Then 5 years later they just plop back in the Lurker Disruptor Reaver and some sort of Valkyrie Wraith hybrid the Liberator I often question Blizzard for their decision making It s extremely odd untimely and usually short of excitement
I thought you were trying to have a discussion not just be generally salty and use lore as a game argument Every race has big defenders advantage aspects not offense is the best defense Bunkers pfs repair queens these are defense only tools for the most part Mothership core is a unit not a building last time I checked But yeah I didn t say there aren t other solutions and a shield batter might be one but trying to make comparisons to brood war when a photon cannon on top of a ramp could do a shit ton more then it can now is kinda silly But yeah don t bother responding if you are going to do so with salty balance whine and brood war talk when you probably didn t even play it
Oh I didn t know we were measuring our e cocks I ve been playing StarCraft since the very beginning stopped around 2006 Same goes for SC2 up to this day albeit not as frequently as I watch it It s not so much of a stretch to mention the Shield Battery when Blizz bringing back iconic units or their spiritual successor such as the lurker and disruptor into LotV Don t put your words into other peoples mouths btw it s childish and arrogant But yeah don t bother responding if you are going to be high on your horse pretending to know more about the state of SC2 when you probably can t even get out of silver league s
How to defend as protoss against almost any early game mid game attack have a pylon RTS is about an interaction between the players with different strategies unit combination timings and positioning It s not exactly fun when the solution to basically every type of early aggression Terran can do is is built a single unit MSC Worse still it is literally just a single click to do it No kiting no micro no real decision Defending with the MSC looks almost identical at any level which is indicative of how little depth it actually has
there is still positioning involved unless you want to stay on just one base also widowmines a lot of zerg and protoss agression into t is defended by have a depot wall Do we start crying and calling depots a bandaid fix for a badly designed race lacking a melee unit no we stop doing builds that dont work and spent the last 5 years without any agression prior to 7 minutes vs terran restrictions like these are what makes your point about timings possible competent players realise that there is a new timing constraint and adapt to it incompetent players keep doing the same stuff and complain about it on reddit hoping that the game will be patched to cater to the one build they haven t strayed from for 4 years while talking about interaction reaction counters and strategy amongst other things
Artosis OH LOOK OUT TASTELESS HE HAS A PYLON LETS SEE HOW WELL HE PLACED IT This is what you pay to see is it
It s not exciting but building placement is fundamental to the game
Getting erect over how well placed a pylon is when it murders an entire strategic attack shows just how piss poor Protoss options are to micro and actually show off their skill
Point for truth 8 10 Execution 3 10
There are many games where good strategies are trumped by simple actions In Magic there s a deck that takes up 8 10 of the meta yet it s absolutely wrecked by a single card
No you can t compare the meta of other games to justify an obvious design flaw in this game I m not saying you aren t making a decent point just that you are comparing potatos to oranges so to speak
It used to be Artosis OH LOOK OUT TASTELESS HE HAS A FORCEFIELD LETS SEE HOW WELL HE PLACED IT
Yes and it was even more of a knife edge race back then because the race is poorly designed Design cracks show ith shit like this Protoss missed 1 hex of the ramp with their forcefield and so now zerglings are inside the base gg tasteless is now Oh the pylon overcharge was baited so hes just going to wait and then run in after it s finished and the Protoss has nothing to defend against this attack because he played too greedy and relied on his MSC too much Do you really think that they have much choice Because I don t because race design dictates this
We literally just watched snute take what should ve been 2 straight games against likely the best protoss in the world by simply making lings baiting 1 overcharge backing off for 14 seconds then going back in and killing the nexus un deterred Meanwhile zerg is able to take 2 bases before their spawning pool without any viable game ending punishment from a protoss Seriously what is the complaint against protoss here
Haven t you been on reddit bro When a Zerg or Terran wins it s all skill When a toss wins it s OP But when said toss loses hes just a baddie obviously
The complaint isn t that the mothership core is OP or uneeded the real problem with the unit is that it is a poorly designed bandaid for a gaping wound Yes the mothership core allows protoss players to play a little bit more greedy and be able to defend aggression with less units but it is at it s core a very boring unit with little interaction It s damage is so low that having an attack is almost meaningless and because of this it relies heavily on photon overcharge which by it s nature is not very fun for either player unless you re playing with aggressive pylons which is hilarious due to the lack of interaction from either side Time warp is a much more interesting ability protoss engages at the time warp and their opponent tries to engage around I m not sure if my point was clear but basically it s kind of boring at what it does even though it does it decently
To add to this the amazingly low cost and how early you get it means it also influences basically any game and especially feels like a band aid solution For example a mothership hero like unit costs like 500minerals 450gas takes a looong time to build and to get it requires tier 3 buildings
And if they d buff Protoss units so that they can actually defend without the need for the overcharge then you d just turn your bitching towards the units And so the cycle of irrational Protoss hate continues
Because buffing Protoss units would instantly kill the game
If it wasn t balanced sure but it s more likely that they will buff the static defenses of Protoss like cannons while in base or the design of sentry OR they will start getting oracles for the sake of stasis warding key positions in order to stall attacks who knows but the possibilities are endless once you remove the band aid fix that ruined an entire fucking race You are ignoring the level of skill required to micro in defense build the right units scout it with enough time to get defense ready and possibly set up a counter attack to hit around the time that the attack actually hits while also building more units to bolster the defense and not instantly lose the game as opposed to clicking a fucking pylon and turn it into a cannon the second the opponent is in vision of your base while blindly and freely roaming the opponent s base with a warp prism that can save pick up from 1 8 the width of your screen that kind of shit is intended for people with little to no brain power
I was talking about Terran And you miss my main point which is I don t think it even means that protoss is overpowered but none of that changes the fact that it s bad design I don t do one base terran aggression auto lose because of MSC and then complain I complain because a single unit literally stops any aggression from working with almost no micro or skill It s a design complaint not balance I don t think it makes protoss unbeatable
a single unit literally stops any aggression from working with almost no micro or skill You are balance whining And it almost sounds like you re talking about a liberator
That s still not a balance whine Balance is win nothing to do with micro skill etc Please link me a game where an early liberator is used to stop a group of units in defense PvT
I didnt say it was bad design I just spent about as much effort fabricating an excuse to call something bad design instead of plis nurf i dont want to adapt
I saw the no very clearly on the next page I m making the point that your argument is completely flawed because you are comparing the most fundamental and essential component of Terran that has not once had a single complaint EVER to justify a spell that majority of the vocal community has agreed is a band aid fix for poor design and is poorly designed itself Take a good look at Photon Overcharge Then look at bunkers and spine crawlers compared to pylons Which cost more Which of them take longer to build Which are not already there out of passive necessity e g supply creep spread before an attack is scouted or begun You really are not making a good case for yourself and that is not really in your control you are simply defending a case that is ultimately unwinnable
depot walls can be defeated though zerg can bling bust or got for fast drop while protoss can lol pylon rush and take down the wall and rush adpets in all this can be defended if scouted and reacted to properly but they still require a reaction from terran name one strategy that either race can throw at protoss that requires a different reaction than clicking on pylons THATS what u jellojellojello4 was trying to argue that protoss doesnt need more than one reaction to ANYTHING in the early game and that makes them boring and gimmicky
I do think msc isn t a good unit but because of its near requirement for protons its importance esp pvz and hero style units That being said pylon cannon doesn t defend against cloaked banshees widow mines liberators with just the right position or cyclones with vision not to mention overwhelming unit counts that can pummel pylons or elevator to where there are few pylons
But we don t bring those issues up because then we couldn t complain about protoss
Does defending with bunkers look any different at different levels does defending your 4th with a PF look any different Frankly its easy to argue that overcharge has more depth then bunkers and PFs do Overcharge baiting simple focusing down the pylons cyclone pylon interaction pylon positioning abusing pylon coverage overbuilding pylons to defend scouted attacks mothership core mobility and multi prong aggression PF just sits there are shoots but I don t see PF is a bandaid A lot of depth was added to overcharge in lotv Say what you want about pylons shooting but it created a lot of counter play and a lot more investment and careful planning and SimCity locations being reactive to scouting information and the such I ve seen a lot of games lost due to pylon placement so yeah a lot of difference between a good and a bad player in that not to mention good players know how to be conservative with the mothership core energy So really say what you want about it but saying it has no depth and acting like its no better then it was in hots is just silly
They re not comparable man Jesus Christ You have to put UNITS inside bunkers for them to be useful With OC you pop it on supply creating buildings that you have to build anyway The only addition is the MSC Why do you insist on conveniently overlooking this
I m not But they are comparable Its a vehicle to get a lot of defenders advantage its just a different way to go about it Every race is different etc etc PF shoots without units inside of it Spines and cannons and spores and turrets etc Bunkers and overcharge serve the same purpose To allow you to defend cost efficiently So you saying that 2 things that serve the same exact purpose shouldn t be comparable just seems odd to me
You say I m making flawed arguments when you cant even keep the difference between power and depth straight Your bunker anolgy is just retarded and ignores any points of how overcharge function Youre discounting PFs because of the timing and literally saying the power of PF isn t important which once again I was talking about design a no click afk defended base when a PF is sooo strong that terrans forgo an orbital for it If you don t see addiontal depth and counter play between hots mamacore and lotv one you are just an idiot There is room to argue against the mothership core I don t deny that But there are just some flat facts that all denying them does is discredits your views of the game
Frankly based on this whole post I would be surprised if you have even played the game Overcharge was reduced greatly in range duration and the overcharged building having significantly less health as well as having to invest money in more pylons then required much like making a bunker and salavaging it later to defend against specific timings and fresh locations If that doesn t add depth via planning investment and significantly more counter play that both players have to work around to you then you just don t understand starcraft There isn t room to argue there Everything else you said is just an extension of that lack of understanding Even the most die hard biased terran player would admit that if they actually understand the game at a reasonable level No point in having any further conversation with someone who doesn t understand the game not going to read a response
I was rank 2 masters as protoss last season for the record Extra pylons are still cheaper than cannons which you almost never see You can rattle on about all the things you do with the MSC but there s a reason you never here casters talking about amazing skill used with this MSC tasteless But ok bro make your point then close your ears that s how you win an argument
The MSC is copping abuse for what it actually does not for the unit that it is A core tech unit that can fly is already very powerful on its own due to the timing that you can get it it hard counters all early game units with the exception of marines with equal or greater value and to balance that you can only make one It is basically a flying cyclone in that regard The actual problem is it s spells I m not even going to go into mass recall because that was a blatant band aid fix to the immobility of the Protoss army but Photon Overcharge and Time Warp are beyond this I ll put it this way If you agree with Blizzard that a single unit that can cast spells which turn a pylon into a cannon thus negating the need to actually build cannons is considered good game design then you are part of the small minority of people that David Kim has succeeded in pleasing but you are part of a small minority because most people hate it This game is a competitive RTS it is built on the principles of the original Starcraft franchise that was proud to be the most mechanically demanding and intricate game regarding strategy even to this day To clarify I have no issue with the evolution of Starcraft you cannot re create Brood Wars and expect people to flock to the same game with 3D graphics it s a pipe dream But if you compare anything in that game to Photon Overcharge you will see why MSC gets so much hate
Well memed
This kind of balancing doesn t help
Haha this is great
Still killed the SCVs slower than Adepts
Well he forgot to overcharge the Pylons
Replace pylons with adepts and thats what TvP felt like last patch
but we already have the warp prism adeptlord gif what if we combined them
A core that shoots pylons that are overcharged and summon adepts with every shot who in turn fire mothership cores
RIP my ears
I almost fulfilled the lycan prophecy when I clicked on that link holy poop
Man I wish these pylons were shooting like overcharged pylons It would fit so well
I tried it s hard to pull off EDIT When you switch the Interceptor weapon they get buggy https gfycat com LegitimateAdoredKarakul https gfycat com AnimatedDelayedDunlin
As a Zerg main this is what it feels like sometimes
that looks somewhat disturbing not for the faint hearted
Ahli could help
Audio source
I did wonder why they were yelling S4
That video is amazing
stahp you re gonna accidentally make sc3 P
Core ier has arrived
Legacy of the Mothership core
The one and only thing keeping SC2 back from greatness and carrying Protoss players into the late game
RIP HEADPHONE USERS GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Holy shit I fucking love you man
Love Your GirlFriend
made me laugh
do one for tankvacs
Bahahahahaha
not sure where the cast is from but this is totally why Korean cast is better
I would play the shit out of this
The sad part is that this is only 50 more retarded than the current version of the mothership core
ahahahahaha
That is exactly what Terran tears are made from
lol any Korean speakers around to explain what they re actually saying
It s the Dota 2 The International 3 Grand final when Alliance was taking the last win with the million dollar dream coil
To correct you wasn t the million dollar dream coil that was TI1 with Na Vi Otherwise it was TI3 grand final last game before Alliance got the W Edit After watching video found out I was incorrect Apologies
million dollar coils is from TI3 by S4 I am pretty positive Here is a Korean cast of it https www youtube com watch v wkHVLeR72b4
Oh S4 was Puck Oh gotcha it was multiple dream coils I always associated the million dollar dream coil with Dendi with his huge play after Rosh Apologies I ll throw in the edit
here you go
According to the audio source linked about Pummel it Pummel it S4 S4 S4 GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG I missed some lines but yeah its not related to SC2 unfortunately lol
How much for one and I will take one
ESPO ESPO ESPOOOOO
accurate
That s fucking hilarious I love Starcraft humour
pretty balanced if you ask me
Haha i feel like the commentating is the voices of all the pylons
The beautiful sound of koreans speaking Hype
idk about you but I d be terrified out of my mind if someone ran into the CoC yelling at the top of their lungs that Pylons were destroying the base Even if they weren t shooting things imagine accidentally getting smacked by a flying pylon You d be a tiny bloody smear on its shielding before getting flung into the distance
hahaha so good
GEEEE GEEEE
This is actually how it is right now
Mothership core is a significant factor in why I still haven t bought LotV And I play Protoss I just don t want to play a game with such a stupid fucking unit
Ok have fun playing WoL with the 4 other people who still play
Yea you should totally come play LOTV where you will get nothing but shit simply because of the race you play
Toss has got shit for all of the games Its not like it s new
I think he plays starbow
lol I haven t laddered since two weeks after HotS released
They should remove the mothership core to cater to you the guy who doesn t play the game he s complaining about
MSC is a horribly designed band aid hero unit It doesn t belong in the game It s not my problem if you can t acknowledge that I figured the band aid would be ripped off with LotV I was wrong
It s not a perfect solution but nothing is StarCraft 2 isn t ever going to be broodwar

Bias is strong with this one
Well that was unexpected
Up voted for MS paint skills
I like this idea a tonne
I love it but for whatever reason the hole in the bottom ravager is unsettling
yeh maybe if it changed colors or had an animation to match the cooldown speed Not a fan of the black hole either on a sidenote i think as many units as possible should have these actual visual indicators Its a nice thing to have
I wish they would get rid of the indicator that roaches have burrow movement It s supposed to come as a surprise
What s the indicator
Spikes on back
Huh never noticed Thanks
They get extra spikes or crystals on their backs
i suppose if you were really going for the surprise element your first contact would be sharking in to the mineral lines instead of just burrowing in combat But I do see your point
Yeah it s pretty dumb that it signals to get ready for it It s already a pretty weak strategy overall
r trypophobia
I love that 4chan made up trypophobia and now there s a whole bunch of people that think they have it
There s some evidence that it s a biological revulsion instead of a learned cultural fear though The paper basically argues that we evolved to be instinctively fearful of dangerous creatures full of holes such as swarm hosts
The first time i saw zebra mussels underwater i was freaked out by them like they made me feel uncomfortable or imagine a barnacle suddenly opening its mouth and biting your finger They re unsettling
If its any consolation that s not actually a barnacle s mouth A barnacle is basically an upside down shrimp that lives in a house the house is the part you see When the mouth opens up its little feet come out and bring in food
still makes me shutter thanks for the insight
I think it s fair to say that if you think you have a phobia you have it
It s the same thing as the whole Boycott Star Wars thing The problem didn t exist until 4chan decided to make it exist
4chan isn t some magical place where ideas are born People may have always had an irrational fear or feeling of discomfort of those tiny holes Now there s a word
Ive always had that fear I tried to explain it to friends but no one understood until last year when the word became popular
r hypochondria
Not the same thing A phobia is entirely in the mind It doesn t matter if I believe I have a cold if I exhibit literally none of the physical symptoms
4chan didnt make up trypophobia at all although it seems to have been around since 2012 Source https en wikipedia org wiki Trypophobia
To be honest I ve been disturbed by those pores but only on skin ever since I saw some photoshopped picture of nipples with pores supposedly caused by a parasite or something This was like 10 years ago But if it s just holes on random objects it doesn t bother me
This is a great idea and it would be consistent with other cooldown based mechanics like the widow mine and disruptor
I m still not keen on these two I ve become used to the widow mine but Disruptors look the same to me
Well the disruptor changes while the ball is out at least The ravager doesn t change at all Also I think the disruptor core should be changed to show that it s on cooldown It was a frequent suggestion during beta
Yes I can tell when the disruptor has the ball thing out because it is frozen in place But I can t tell which is on cool down if there are many of them
I think this is a good idea Make in an indicator for both opponents I always thought it would be nice to see the bile in an arch flying to its objective instead of this straight up straight down thing This would allow them to remove the cursor from the ground and make it more innate
I agree that the straight up straight down thing doesn t feel right to me anyway but that wouldn t work because Corrosive Bile does damage to air units So it d have to take a very weird trajectory It d also have to move rather slowly and at different speeds depending on how close the target is I d rather they scrapped the ability entirely and came up with something different
Widow mines are kind of like that they change colour on cool down
they do lol i never noticed
Yup they also have a little arming animation when the cooldown expires
This would be a great addition Kind of like how a disruptor telegraph if it s ready to fire again or how bunkers show if they re loaded this would give a good visual indicator of whether or not you should attack into ravagers or not
That would be a great change I think both zerg players and opponents would want this so they can see how many shots are left
I love it
Why are there so many units with no indication that an ability is on off cooldown in starcraft to begin with I cant tell if a bunch of stalkers have blink on cd when i encounter them Sure i can reasonably guess that its off CD but still Same with medivac speedboost
This is very nice suggestion Approved
Really cool idea super for this
Such a great idea Combining utility and design
This would be beneficial for the zerg player for sure When I offrace I often shift spam bile if I have 10 ravagers and I m pretty clueless when I ran out and when they re recharged again And I imagine it wouldn t be too big of a hassle to make it look good as well
I hope they do the same for the Disruptor
But then people are gonna want blink stalkers and disruptors to do the same for fairness
And why not honestly sc needs these kind of visual indication Look at lings with and without speed easy to spot the difference Same for marine with CS
Or roaches with tunneling claws
visual indicators all around are a great idea imo also it would be cool if units did more to show how much health they had kind of like how buildings have fire animations when theyre on low hp
Now that you mention it I wonder what the stalker change would be I think Disruptors would be very beneficial in gameplay Even if I am controlling them I am not sure which ones have cooldown or not
Just make the legs glow when they have blink available
That would look kinda cool actually Would be useful on both sides
disruptors already have different animation depending on readiness of their ability
You can tell when a roach has burrow movement but not when a stalker has blink
I don t play Zerg this is a really good idea regardless
Great idea but the technology just isn t there yet
No thanks because that looks terrifying
This is something that would be recognized as a good idea and added into the game if Valve was developing sc2 Since Blizzard develops this game great suggestions like this will just fade away
i r8 this 8 8 m8
Not sure if they can afford to allocate one of their 4 developers to do this OHSHITWAIT I m supposed to be positive Not sure if they can allocate one of their 150 developers to do this
Sure if it didn t look gross and weird
It makes the unit less skilled Since when you use this abillity you count how many you use atleast on high level Also the opponent counts how many you use and take the ravagers minus the abillity that got used For example 10 ravager 5 used it 10 5 5 left Now instead you can see it
Not actually you will not have time to count them in the middle of a fight If you want to know how many you have the easy way is still count how many you have Side note I knew someone would skill gap argumento
That s some highlevel analysis right there
But what about epileptics Kappa Edit Jesus people are sensitive Seemed like a good joke the CD being so short on bile and all
I feel like MC is such an epitome for what playing purely to win is To me it feels right that he is the one who passed half a million in winnings
That IEM trailer man where we can see his back and he lifts the cup my favorite esports moment
Agreed
I feel like Life is such an epitome for what playing purely to win is To me it feels right that he is one who passed 450k in winnings
but he betrayed us all
oGs hasn t been around in over 4 years o o
Do you have a source or are you just speculating that they disbanded Next you ll tell me that HD and Husky stopped hosting the HDH Invitational
deleted
I think hes joking P
I was like wut oGsMC What year is this
On r starcraft it s 2010 forever
If that was true half of the users here would not cry about ded gaem everyday
He s still an OG though
RIP oGs SlayerS TSL foU and the others that have fallen by the wayside
ZeNEX NSH F United FXO IM SouL do you even follow Starcraft
MC is our father
Thanks MC true Starcraft 2 legend Sad times for sure but good to read some words from you
This is strangely comforting Thanks MC
I love MC 3
EffOrt hard What is this sorcery
This is why MC should be in the list of one of the greatest SC2 player of all time Oh wait he s already in the list
MC Huk Destiny and IdrA are my top 4 favourite players of all time MC because he s just legendary and literally godmode and is one of the best if not the best player of all time and has a damn funny personality too HuK is great because he s a lot like MC he s very funny too and he s a Canadian Protoss just like me although I Zerg and Protoss now plus it s always funny watching him try to do Gateway allins and wonder why they don t work and he also has top 3 control IdrA is great because his rage is entertaining and he s funny and I also currently have have had rage issues so I can relate and he s honest Destiny is great because he s entertaining and honest as well
People should realize that all major sports have issues like this It is a reflection on the player not the game DOTA LOL CSGO have similar scandals Boxing Soccer and Cycling all have seen scandles that were far more serious as in people die There is an over reaction in the community Things like this are impossible to get rid of Match fixing is a symptom of gambling it is not a reflection of the game The suggestion that Lifes action could some how end the popularity of SC2 is just more of the same chicken little the sky is falling that gets constantly posted on this subreddit
Wasn t there a LoL player who committed suicide because he didn t want to match fixed but he was severely pressured to do so
yes he jumped from a 10 story building and somehow survived and after recovering he became a streamer afaik The manager that fucked his team and him over run away and i dont think he was ever caught
And now some people are saying he the player not the manager is being charged accused of rape
http www inven co kr webzine news news 149611 site lol Can t translate but here is the source for that apparently
Tried to commit suicide didn t die though
In a shady challenger minor league team in Korea though There s never been any match fixing scandal from a major league pro team
no not really The matchfixing in dota was a SEA no name team that wanted cash cause they dont earn shit in SEA and Solo was so long ago and so hillariously cheap that he became the most used dota meme in existence He basically lives in his own purgatory now The fixing in dota wasnt a big deal cause it wasnt one of the best doing it
Much easier to take a dive in a 1 on 1 sport Edit In case people love storms in teacups http www gosugamers net dota2 features 3964 the dota 2 ace alliance corruption and corporatism
I am DDZ I am not 322
And then that thread wound up not even being written by DDZ
Just because it hasn t been uncovered doesn t mean it s not happening
Fixing a match is worst thing you can do its way worse than cheating If you cheat you give yourself an advantage and a possibility to win unless you cheat blatantly but that will never work as a pro while when you fix the match you have determined the outcome 110 In addition it is almost impossible get caught or to even prove it Matchifixing undermines the whole foundation of the sport If there is even the slightest belief that matches are rigged and its not the best player that wins people lose interest quickly And when this is done by someone in the top of the tier 1 then it hits even harder You cannot blame the gambling community for this What should happen though is that the leagues should have contracts with SERIOUS financial repercussions if a teammember is get caught cheating or matchfixing Then the team would have to have similar contracts with their players This way you would remove most of the incentive for teams to perhaps aid such cheating matchfixing as well as hopefully have them taking proper anticheat fixing measures
Firstly the only reason there is match fixing is because of the gambling No one loses on purpose to gain nothing unlike cheating which people do all the time for no financial gain Secondly threating huge financial punishment is a quick way to get rid of leagues Who would want to sponsor a team under the threats of law suits and financial penalties Life time bans are allready in place from kespa If others joined in to prevent match fixers from earning a living off the game it would help Point is you dont punish the organization you punish individuals What should be done Target the ones paying the players and ban people involved from the sport Unfortunately there is not much more that can be done Once again match fixing is not a problem that specific games have Match fixing happens when an event is gambled on The more money that you can potentially win the bigger and shadier people you will attract to start fixing matches Any draconian measures aimed at teams end match fixing will only prevent people from creating teams at all Sad part is that THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MATCH FIXING It is impossible to be inside the hearts of the players All we can do is ban them from the sport The more popular a game is the more severe that punishment becomes
People do cheat for financial gain just look at the KQLY incident in CSGO Regardless you should be able to hold an organisation responsible If not you can come in situations like we have seen in many other sports like Cycling and recently Russian track and field where organisations teams put so much pressure on athletes and encourage them to do illegal stuff in order to produce good placements and improve sponsor income Its easy for sponsors to avoid getting fined just by adding simple clauses that don t make them liable The main goal here is to get organisations and teams to oppose all forms for cheating and match fixing and to know the risk They might enforce drug controls gambling prohibition and hardware anti cheat measures themselves to make sure they are as clean as possible And yes involved players and other teammembers should receive life time bans as well as financial fines
I d disagree and say cheating is worse In a twisted way when a player match fixes he helps another person at their own expense Cheaters only look out for themselves Could you imagine if the headline were Life paid other people to lose to him Or Life figured out to maphack in official matches Only thing is it s much harder to cheat in a good system
Match fixing is considered worse than cheating and rightfully so It is much easier to develop proper anti cheats both software and hardware than to detect and prove match fixing Also the money one can make for one throw way more than what you can make for a win with cheats
That would have broken my heart If the amazing talent that was shown was an illusion honestly it would have taken away from my love of SC2 With the matchfixing I m like life you fucking idiot why but you are still a god at SC2 and nothing will ever change that
322 Keepo
LoL NEVER had such a scandal
So have other more american sports NFL MLB NBA Concussions sports gambling domestic abuse DWI s drug abuse steroids etc
I know he is right It still doesn t make it any less upsetting Especially for someone I guarantee probably got a fair amount of people into Starcraft Just need time
Why would Blizzard decide to bar someone like MC from competing in NA and EU He has way more personality than all the foreignors I d rather listen to his broken english than another sports interview with a foreigner
oGs haven t heard this for a long time
oGsMC 4Head
So sad that Blizzard BANNED MC from competing I miss him
i don t really know what he s trying to say tbh
Most players How many matchfixers are there left
RIP Ma Bonjwa
The Destruction of Lilbow Part II
basically Who knows he may pull something off and win a game but I have a feeling he ll just die in 5 minutes like he did vs Life
SPOILER The Destruction of Lilbow Part II is just as predictable as the Hangover part II was to the original Hangover When is part III going to be I hope it ll be as entertaining and predictable as the Hangover part III will be
I would be if I didn t work tomorrow
Call in sick I m sure your boss would understand
Boss I m sick You don t sound sick Please this is the first time I ll get to watch the Koreans since the lock you must really be sick I guess
Can we please have a non region locked tournament in an acceptable timeslot for NA
This is acceptable Started 930 or 1030 NA and was over by 1
HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE
Noooo Polt and MC Although I kinda expected it though I still like Soulkey and Byun
I stopped caring once they were eliminated No Terrans as usual and no bosstoss
Byun is Terran
Oh Damn a Terran is still in Or was I guess nathanias was trolling when he said there were no more Terrans yesterday
I m pretty sure he meant no more terrans for the night
Yea he was always maybe you mix him up with Hyun or ByuL both of them are Zergs
No I know he is I was just asking Derp if he knew
Is it on twitch
I believe it ll be here http www twitch tv esl sc2
It s started now
Super hyped about tomorrows games But i have college in the morning so sads about tonight
I do too but Passion and redbull will carry me through the night and tomorrow
watched entire thing series 2 and 4 were the best good times peaked at 14k
I mean we were on par for the course compared to GSL viewers I was a bit disappointed that we had such long breaks sometimes because I m pretty sure that broke the momentum Also peaked at nearly 17k http www fuzic nl events 7631 iem
Let s go Snute
let s do this
finally
Hyped But why is this competition taking place on Sunday to Tuesday
It s in a weird timezone for many people Decent time at night for NA but Europe it s like 4 AM It s really just a 2 day event
why isn t incontrol listed as a host commentator on liquidpedia was there a last minute change
I m disappointed if Snute doesn t try any anti 3rd builds against herO I have a feeling herO knows how to defend them and I want to see how D
Is this not an offline event Where are the players
HITMAN IS BACK With the proxy gate forge Fucking grosssssss
Hitman v Elazer NO GG S
Great matchups on paper Can t wait
Idk I liked the old format also Snute plays last FeelsBadMan jpg
The players are still being announced but the current ones are Cure Snute TLO Hydra Bly Rogue VortiX Ryung Polt Kelazhur Nerchio sOs
sOs and Polt D Definitely tuning into this
Honestly this is my favorite type of line up Good foreigners and good koreans mixed together I ll be watching for sure if I am able
Nice lineup
Invite Marinelord Uthermal plz D
all the invites are finalized I invited both of those players btw but only one was able to make it this time We just need a replacement for Life soon as I find someone we ll announce the matchups
Does it have to be a zerg If not Mil Showtime would be a cool player to see if he is available
Showtime s awesome and one of the players we considered and wanted we weren t able to reach him as quickly as others probably just because I don t have his skype tbh T T but it ahs to be Korean it s 8 koreans 8 foreigners
Bring your boy DongRaeGu
This is one crazy freaking lineup By the way do we know who the casters are yet
So insane you have Rogue sOs Cure and Polt
Awesome great to see Polt and Cure Love me some good Terran action
sickkk cure and o
Did you say sOs Oh boy
dollar sign oh dollar sign oh take me away 3 3
day and time with sOs in it I can t miss it
I love the lineup but I feel that Snute and TLO are a bit outclassed here
This is unfair People want to see their local NA stars duke it out not Koreans Then NA can be as good as Koreans in the future This is a well established fact
Yeah we do but we all love watching Korean vs Foreigner attempts too We ll probably get crushed but when it s not every single tournament going on then I m okay with it
JAGW players Yes please 8 foreigners and 8 koreans really looking foward to this
Vortix gonna show everybody who s boss now
Holy s awesome lineup o and Polt if TY plays it will be the most hype tournament
Sick line up can t wait to watch
This looks fantastic Now if my favourite player would just play in it that would be ByuNd fantastic
I m looking forward to this event The lineup is really sick
look at all the JinAir players what relation might Catz have with them hmmmm Anyway I m definitely cheering for the JinAir boys and Snute and VortiX and Hydra So damn excited
it s really easy to ask players to ask their teams or certain players of their teams for instance I asked Ryung to ask if GuMiHo or DeParture from his team would be interested but they weren t this time hydra asked ByuL to ask popular CJ players I asked him to msg Life and ask afreeca freecs ask JinAir etc Earlier this week I asked Solar to ask Samsung if they would be willing to play a showmatch vs WCS as a team I also asked soO and hydra also asked Innovation we ve asked Flash and KT players in the past The great majority of answers is usually sorry we can t or I want to but it s up to my team or conflicting events etc etc The relation is as simple as we ask our friends to ask their friends on our behalf this time around JinAir and other KeSPA teams were more open to playing than usual because proleague season is just starting
Dude you are awesome Keep up the good work
Great lineup Looking forward to pretty much every match
Awesome nice to see some good news
Pretty sick lineup indeed Go Snute D
Really nice looking forward to it
Wow this is awesome Cheering for TLO and Snute
I m pretty excited for this Any chance of a rebroadcast at a more NA friendly time
Not 100 certain but since it will be on CatZ s twitch channel you should be able to watch the vod whenever you want to
Yeah that is a crazy lineup Gonna be glued to the PC for this one
Looking forward to it
Amazing initiative is CatZ gonna be casting with that other dude from recently again sorry other dude I cant remember your name
The last tournament had x5 Kawaiian cocasting https twitter com x5 Kawaiian
why is it not on tl
No idea I was going to link the post to the TL page but couldn t find one
http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Kings of the Craft
Thank you very much
would still be nice to have a TL thread in the Tourneys section I tweeted Catz about it I don t feel comfortable making it myself o
Looking great awesome Root keeps organising these kind of tournaments
WANNA KNOW THE BEST PART OF THE WCS CHANGES Now there s a really big difference between Premier and grass roots online tournies Before it was basically the same thing except for prize pools Now this is a great chance to see Foreigners vs Korea THAT S something worth getting excited about this year
My family will be watching the superbowl but I ll be tuned into this bad boy WOOOOO Starcraft I love you
I love me some sick online invitationals I just hope Rob from production is there He is the best part

Bold move hosting it on Super Bowl Sunday
I don t know quite a large amount of the audience is probably non american
I was joking because I didn t think there d be a huge overlap in the fan bases Maybe I should have added kappa
I was too Kappa
Is there a TeamLiquid thread about it Reddit Twitter is really terrible for following a tournament and keeping on updated information I want to be hyped but I don t know anything about it
Vamos Juan VortiX la armada espa ola Excited to see this after Catz rant More ROOT things please
Can t wait Hopefully if it s at a crazy time for NA we can get a vod to watch of it later but this is exactly what the scene needs right now Thank you to all of Team ROOT for setting this up
Calling it now Polt or Rogue are gonna win No matter how hard we ban them from our tournaments Koreans are still better
Which is precisely why they re banned
It s region locked not race locked Hydra Violet and Polt are all living in America hence they can compete in WCS
Can t help but notice this is now useless facts about feardragon instead of with feardragon
Maybe feardragon is a reaper
Fear the reaper
That s not the Illuminati song that s the X Files theme
God dammit I woke up 2 minutes ago and felt like I needed to post one quickly Maybe rushed a little too much
I like it can we keep it this way
Unless you change the posting rules of Reddit it will be staying this way
I think they meant that they d like future useless facts Feardragon posts to keep the new and accidental Useless Facts About Feardragon title
Ah I see I thought they wanted OP someone to change the post title
You are now a reaper congrats
Useless facts about fear dragon 1 He sometimes posts in haste and makes typos
For a second I thought I was on r StarcraftCirclejerk
Terran so underpowered their units can t even get kills
Not shown The kill is actually credited to a Cyclone on the other side of the map
Or that Carbot Tempest from outside the galaxy
Wasn t there a glitch before that teleporting bcs count as resources lost Terran so up they lose units before losing them
I know the past two days haven t been the most uplifting in terms of news but don t forget the game will continue to be there for us and we still have a lot of cool stuff happening in the scene If you want to see more useless facts easiest way to find them is here
People are only creating drama so you will post more useless facts
This fact isn t about feardragon I m disappointed
Does the nexus still have a kill count while the Pylon does not
This is more like a bug fact tho xD
I agree
I don t think so I can t think of any reason to consider this a bug
Because it s clearly not working correctly
He s trolling Check his other response
They re joking about the original double post 1 and 2
Oh I m an asshat ty
This joke is really not getting the praise it deserves
Well it s still useless even if it works right
Maybe if it was a zerg reaper
This is a useful fact for casters Are they actually the 1
Very useful for players too Unit kill count determines which Reaper is going to get sent on a suicide scouting mission
Useless fact about fear dragon he does not own feardragon1 to feardragon63
literally unplayable
Well If Grenade was still alive it will have one kill Duh
Reapers don t kill SCV s grenades do
Very useless as always
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE
Super easy to fix for Blizz Great find D
We should make a tournament with a mod where those facts are completely emphasized
Glorious Absolutely fantastic
Hmm this is interesting for spectators right Or is that just me
Already knew this one they should make it count though
This is more like a bug fact tho xD
I disagree
Eh I would consider this a bug The kill counter should display every kill the unit makes regardless of if it was a spell or ability
The unit is the grenade apparently It s like vultures and spider mines
You believe grenades should have free will and be responsible for their actions hmm
According to the engine the grenade is a unit as much as the reaper is
Repost this if you are a beautiful strong grenade who don t need no reaper
This seems like a bug
Have you ever done one about how Banelings have a kill counter Seems kinda useless to me
I miss when they used those grenades on buildings p
Under what scenario would this ever be useful misleading advertising
If you wonder how much damage you did worker harassing you might look at your reapers kills If some kills were from the grenade this might cause you to underestimate the amount of damage you did making you believe your opponent is in a better position than he really is
And vice versa If I am jumping around the map while defending a harass I will click on the enemy until to see how many kills it has to judge how much damage it did
Exactly this Polt once was not sure if he killed a worker at the 3 minute mark and he was trying to figure it out for a solid 15 seconds It probably wouldn t have affected anything but hey if even a pro is bugged by it
This was actually a good response That makes a lot of sense although I never really glance down at my reaper kills especially if I have built more than one I guess that is what makes it 1 useful though right
Read the title again
The antonym of useless if useful 99 useless implies 1 useful PlainSight provided an actual answer that put together a scenario where this information would be useful
It says useless not useful The opposite
You have managed to make this all about you again didn t you
have you been watching polt s stream
this is the worst SC news I ve ever read
I loved him so much As much as a grown man can love a 17 year old Asian boy But now he has gone and broke my heart Edit Okay he s only been accused Innocent until proven guilty But still it s so damn sad to read
It s believed they have enough evidence to prosecute him for it that s why this next step has been taken As sad as it makes me the chances he is innocent are getting smaller
Yeah they don t tend to go after athletes or sport icons if there aren t some pretty solid evidence
Well thats good news for him then
There are several ways to love a 17 year old Asian boy
All of them shamefully

There s a 98 conviction rate Unless he miraculously falls into the 2 he s guilty
So you re saying there s a chance
Life finds a way
Yeh it s pretty sad T T
Look at it from the bright side now the Korean scene has more room for new talent Everything will be fine s
Downsizing is healthy boys
D O W N S I Z E B O Y S
So Life in prison
most likely a life ban from the scene and probably anything else in korea he is basically fucked in korea shit like this follows you forever
Not necessarily we need to wait and see the facts how he s prosecuted and if he s convicted Dragon had a match fixing scandal and was eventually found to be innocent now he streams with a decent following I think Life could still be an SC2 pro if he s found to be innocent but that s a big and optimistic if
I thought it was for maphacking
The initial controversy with Dragon was over stream cheating not maphacking He openly admitted and apologized for listening to a live stream of the match against TheStC Later in an unrelated thing he was accused of match fixing vehemently denied it and was eventually cleared of all charges but not before he took some pretty bad flak for it
They have a 98 conviction rate He s utterly screwed
That s Japan
see page 258 it s high but it s roughly 70 just eyeballing the ratio it s nowhere NEAR 90 https books google com books id pLbnCAAAQBAJ pg PA259 lpg PA259 dq korean conviction rate source bl ots CezHUcA4Id sig 9OCGtB75ToWDbStw0t15rGnBt68 hl en sa X ved 0ahUKEwiu pe6qdXKAhVGeSYKHbsxDKoQ6AEIJzAB v onepage q korean 20conviction 20rate f false
But after that scandal Dragon hasn t been able to participate in any tourneys that I can remember Also the whole fiasco with Slayers He derived his income instead from streaming which is fine and used his notoriety to his advantage so to speak
I dunno if that was because he was banned from tourneys or because he just wasn t well known enough to continue participating Do you know if he was perma banned I think if Life is found to be innocent ala Dragon he could recover
Gsl banned him for a while and slayers dropped him so he effectively couldnt compete in korea for a few years and i dont think hes capable of competing at this point in korea due to his relative to others lower skill level
Essentially his normal life in Korea is over Best move if he gets convicted or whatever you call it for him will probably to live elsewhere
The long game to avoid military service It s all clear to me now
I come from the small tribe of r osugame and its both interesting and depressing to see that other games are this affected by conscription
Savior didn t leave his house for years after the incident
How familiar are you with korean culture Their entire society condemns you the second you get convicted for this His future employers are gonna see thos etc
people should see the things that happen in kpop peoples lives get ruined over silly shit that they didn t even do
For those out of the know he s how ridiculous KPop gets Female pop stars frequently have clauses in their contracts stating that they can t date anyone Ever The idea is that fans who desire to be with singers will feel like the celebrity is attainable very deliberate use of the word attainable here so long as they re single Female performers have lost rights to their creative work and have lost contracts over paparazzi catching them on dinner dates And these women rarely if ever receive another contract from any entertainment company Those women are blacklisted throughout the industry for going on a dinner date South Korea takes celebrity culture way too seriously

Great write up you found Thanks for sharing
Sure thing I had just happened to read this a few days ago I was amazed that someone would feel the need to shave their head in contrition for spending the night at their boyfriend s house
Hell a guy s live was ruined for saying that he went to Stanford and the crazy thing is that he did actually do so
You re referring to tablo of epik high He suffered a stupid amount of stress and hardship after the whole fiasco but he is pretty much over it now His albums are stellar and the group is doing better than ever
Also it was proven he actually went
Still he was guilty even after proven innocent
Sounds like a Reddit conviction
Jesus just read the Wiki article about the incident The guy flew to Stanford shot a documentary showing university officials printing the correct documents on camera then was subject to a police investigation that independently confirmed the information And still people didn t believe it Truly insane
Its like how conservatives kept asking for obamas long form birth certificate then they wanted a certificate of life birth Then after that some still dont believe it
Rip Tablo
People didnt want to believe he was so academically successful and intelligent Then look at the IU pedophile bullshit
Yeah its insane how fucked up people can become just because of rumours Lifes status is basically destroyed even if he was innocent
You overestimate it He ll never have a possibility to work in e sport again but Starcraft isn t important enough to really prevent him from getting a job ever again The other problem is he ll have to go to school again
Starcraft maybe is not important enough but think about this He is getting charged for being a part of a match fixing scheme Starcraft does not matter at all in this case If he is proven guilty in a court then it doesn t matter that he did matchfixing in a game like starcraft what matters is that he actually was involved in the matchfixing in the first place I have a friend who did stupid shit when he was younger and now his criminal record is always following him when he applies for work He is a blue collar worker and even that job he got thanks to his mother who is also working in that firm I can add that this is Sweden Now think about South Korea where crimes are actually taken with more seriousness than in Sweden If he is lucky he can manage to find a job and live a normal life
I understand the point My sister s boyfriend was part of a jewelry shop robbery he parked the car a few streets away his cousin told him he just had a small course to make that he was right back The guy didn t know about any robbery and spent one year in prison Although he was freed because it was clear his cousin was the bad guy he has served a sentence although small He followed a program with the prison with the goal to get back to work had a small job in a big State company and after a few years went job hunting again So I had thought that you could live with a judiciary past but I guess this isn t the case everywhere
The people who can really speak as to whether this stuff marks you for life or not are the people who ve been through this What does Savior do today Did he recover from his situation If he says yes well then But if he talks about all these opportunities that he knows full well he s excluded from even after all these years well that s the kind of stuff that you won t walk away from
I see what you did there
I wonder how much money it took to buy Life off I mean the guy made 460 000 in four years of work his match fixing price must be something like 10K if BboongBboong and YoDa were getting 4 6K for their thrown matches
yep 460000 prize money plus the salary if confirmed there must be a lot of money involved let s hope least people possible
A professor one time told me he was approached by a parent after class to buy a grade The dad whipped out his check book and the prof said two million the dad said what and the prof said if this gets out it not only ruins my job here it ruins my career as an educator and it ruins my career as an academic If this gets out it invalidates my entire adult life s effort You want me to gamble that then you better be able to comfortably take care of me into retirement That s what s at stake This kid didn t lose money made leading up the kid lost all the money that would have been available after this including any tangential work related to this Hope the kid took enough to not worry
Assuming he doesnt have repay the money
Your professor is a boss
Well I think it depends on potential payoff for the ones who were going to bet that he would lose So if it s 10 to 1 maybe they pay him more
Life found a way alright
Man life was the iconic player of the HOTS era This is just sad to see
Even late WoL going head to head agains Mvp and winning
Now I m super sour about Life Denying Mvp his G5L fair and square only to throw it all away by matchfixing years later
Looks like Life was the true sAviOr of sc2 indeed
Why did it have to be a zerg player
he was corrupted by the Overmind
It s always the Zerg players sAviOr Ogogo Luxury
Spreads like tumors
Not like this
Not life this

Best FPL anti pick ever
Usually I really enjoy sc2 drama but not this time Please dont be true
To be honest the authorities really need to bust this case wide open and see just how deep the rabbit hole goes I m pretty sure matchfixing in Korea is a wide sweeping issue and that KeSPA are very reluctant to investigate it further especially if we ve seen a number of suspicious series from top tier pros and have some very big names in the scene indicted on charges
He s only 19 and has essentially fucked up his future in Korea or anywhere else for that matter forever
Assuming he s found guilty that is
Even if you proved yourself as innocence you are always going to get discriminated This is particularly the case in Asia
Even if he s found innocent people will talk about it and he may find himself in KeSpa jail
plus 19 is an age of majority in Korea that timing
I don t know how that works in Korea but it s a principle of law that you are tried under the law at the time of the crime occuring ie if you were less than 18 when a crime happened you ll be charged as a minor even if you re 20 when caught If the law changed and became harsher you ll be tried under a softer law too
that would make sense
So if Life does get banned does CJ Bunny automatically get into Code S
Bunny is the only person on the planet praying that life is found guilty xD
I guess even Bunny would hope for Life to not be guilty this would be a huge blow for Korean pros especially
Haha he ll get wrecked by TY again
I guess we have some idea of the names Wolf was hearing during the Prime case now
I m absolutely shattered Life has a legitimate claim as the best SC2 player ever His multiple championships his unending skill at playing series and his opponents We just lost our Lebron James to illegal gambling
Kinda funny because Michael Jordan was involved in a lot of gambling during his career too and would often lose big on bets There s a theory out there that his break to play baseball at the peak of his career was actually a secret deal with the commissioner of the nba so they wouldn t have to publicly suspend or ban him for gambling the way he did
Build a wall to keep the cheating Koreans out of WCS and make SC2 great again
This seems hard to believe Why would someone like Life accept money to fix a match when he s already so successful Why would he need it THIS SUCKS
Young and stupid He s only 19 years old 19 year old me with 400k made would be doing a lot of stupid things
and the fixed matches were done when he was 18 yo
wtf i thought he was like youngest sc2 player in the scene like 14 15 yo Maybe he was last I checked Time flies
2011 he was 14 15 now its 2016 14 5 19
Maybe he was the one to pay DUN DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUN
Threatened
R I P Life and Korean SC2
The scene doesn t rely on one individual The scene will move on and that s all there is to it
The scene will move on but this may affect not only viewership but sponsorship as well which would be a big deal The extent of the damage is tough to guess though
I know if i was an investor this would be a red light for me if he s found guilty it s downright despicable he had the potential to be the best some might say he was no excuse for this shit
Ehh seeing your favorite player get banned for life is going to have a major impact on a lot of viewers including me
he was the only player that got me interested in the game since WOL the only reason I would watch the streams when I had to be sleeping This is really sad If he stops playing I don t think I ll watch sc2 that much
Say that to NA CSGO
NA CSGO was dead in the water anyway
All the banned players chould have show matches sAviOr FTW
idk why but I feel like for some reason Life s dad is involved Never liked that dude His son beat MVP to become GSL champion at 15 and he couldn t even smile
Was hoping Life would be the only player to win the Triple Crown GSL 1 in WoL 1 in HotS 1 in LotV Soo sad now effectively nobody can get this achievement
Whatever hes still the best zerg This new genuinely makes me sad but match fixer or not I d watch any game he played in One thing that worries me about esports scenes in countries with big organised crime is that if big money was riding on these results the chances are big criminals may be involved in fixing them Like do we expect 17 year old korean kids to stare down some hardcore gangsters when professional boxers can t
He should move to America and continue to play We let famous people get away with stuff all of the time
According to Korean news sites there was 9 people in total arrested Probably managers and directors that pushed Life to do it Apparently some gang activity had to do with it as some Korean sites are reporting The big thing here is I doubt it was isolated to just Life He was at the top of the starcraft professional scene I m sure others were involved I remember an Innovation vs EDIT SOULKEY finals where Inno went up 3 0 then Soulkey took 4 games with roach all ins while Inno played uncharacteristically poor and never made one tank to hold it This is crazy all this time wasted watching tourneys that likely were majorily fixed
I realize these things makes you question life itself But dont fall in a conspiracy syndrome
That was Inno vs Soulkey
There have been some Innovation games in the past with suspicious betting patterns but I hope it s not a case where both were involved I assume multiple top level players fixing with their organisations supporting it would be pretty close to a lethal blow for the Korean scene
jesus guys inno plays a very mechanical style and he doesn t respond well to stuff throwing him off he s an insanely good player mechanically and so people do weird stuff to mindgame him and mess with his head that s the way you beat innovation these speculations are ridiculous a machine like player in a macro game getting thrown off with weird strats under insane pressure MATCH FIXING OMG
exactly its also ridiculous because there is literally zero proof about a fix it was a fucking GSL FINALS and OP didnt even remember that it was soulkey and not life which shows the little research he has actually done on this and instead just spits around blind accusations
Well yeah I see no reason to look at that final since it wasn t even Life playing in it Just saying there was at least one match involving Inno losing in a somewhat weird manner that got pulled from Pinnacle because of the betting patterns Game itself was nowhere near as suspicious the MarineKing game that he s apparently been cleared of throwing intentionally though
Seriously He s a suspect he has by no means found guilty yet He allegedly received money for matchfixing until he s found guilty you should all keep your cool and just wait it out Innocent until proven guilty I find it disappointing to see how quickly you guys are jumping the media bandwagon and how fast you do a full 180 on your opinion on someone who is just a suspect tt This is how someone s career and name gets ruined after having been a suspect but proven innocent Plenty of stories around Charges get dropped but the person s name is ruined forever Also Life made almost 500k during his career so financially likely would not have been a motivator IF he already matchfixed he or his close relatives possibly got threatened by dangerous people who don t like being fucked with
I cant imagine they would arrest him with no evidence He might not be guilty but you cant say its looking good

if he s a suspect and was arrested it means they have evidence to support the case as much as i don t want it to be true it seems the odds are against him and even if he was pressured to matchfix from some outside source he d still be permabanned by kespa
I get and respect your point but it s not looking like people apart from the usual retards are throwing shit at anybody there is just sadness in Life s and SC fans because this could be a catastrophe for the entire scene and because it s hard to imagine that a teenager would get this kind of charge without some kind of legit evidence plus believe me if Life is found innocent his reputation won t be ruined at all people are gonna be SO RELIEVED he would be loved even more than he was before
No Reputations take way longer to fix
Not for a small community like Starcraft
You underestimate humans
He was charged according to this tweet You don t arrest someone and charge them if you don t have evidence
He s been arrested There is a 90 something percent conviction rate for this kind of thing and due to how the system works they don t arrest someone unless there s enough to likely convict them They don t arrest suspects Nobody arrests suspects You arrest someone you re going to bring to trial There s a reason why the arrest is the last part of a police drama because that s the guy going to trial Yes he s not been convicted but it s safe to say he will be
They might for a lot of crimes but match fixing or fraud almost never see arrest before a significant case is built up
I completely agree and I hope in hell he is found innocent
Keep in mind the police wouldn t just arrest someone for no reason They have enough evidence against him to arrest and charge him Otherwise they wouldn t risk arresting him and potentially having to let him go I find it highly doubtful the police would arrest someone on a serious charge just because Usually the police investigates first then arrest as necessary
I remember when this happened in BW and thinking At least it won t happen again Really difficult to watch a competition when you have good reason to think it s no longer an actual competition May as well watch pro wrestling or something
Noob here what is match fixing
Losing on purpose Basically if Team A is really favored to win Team B underdog will have a large payout for gambling on them Maxfixing occurs when players from Team A bet on Team B then purposefully lose in order to win a large payout
I should point out that s not necessarily the case in SC2 You don t have to lose to match fix there s bets that say the match will be over within X amount of minutes game time for example you can easily do a one base all in or a speedling rush and end the game quick
This hurts the game s legitimacy If one of the best players in the world is matchfixing that really hurts SC2 chances of becoming popular
The glory days of SC2 are over dude
2011 peak SC2 RIP
If Life match fixed pretty much says everything about the state of SC2 in Korea
How so
if even someone perceived as doing very well winning a lot of things feels like he isnt making enough money to justify it then theres something really wrong i mean its possible life is secretly a sociopath and just doing whatever because why the fuck not but assuming hes a normal person he has to have decent motivation to do something bad
Being well paid or paid at all isn t a panacea for match fixing in SC2 or any other sport traditional or otherwise Plenty of high profile match fixing tampering scandals in sports have involved people that were well compensated by most reasonable standards Sure more money may remove the motivation for some people but there s always others Sometimes it s that they feel like they should be making more sometimes they have a gambling habit sometimes they just spent all the money People look at Life and ask why he made so much money No one knows the reality of his financial situation Maybe he spent it all Maybe his parents took it all from him Maybe he got scammed out of it Point is the motivation for match fixing is not as simple as he isn t getting paid enough
If the allegations are true it has nothing to do with him not making enough money to justify it Life made more money than every single Foreigner in sc2 He earned 473 000 in prizemoney plus salary We don t know what he has done with that money but if he needed to matchfix out of financial pressures it s because of his own mismanagement not cause of the Korean scene
except we now know looking back that many of the early top winners gave their winnings to their teams to keep them afloat giving a rosier impression of the korean scene than was real and even then noone thought it was great sure its possible he somehow lost his winnings but its not the only reason why he might do this
match fixing happens in literally every sport the difference is people in esport are way too young and stupid and get caught
Greed is common habit of humans You dont have to be a socipoath or need to be rich or poor or just want a little more
Life made almost 500k dollars by the age of 19 You dont see MC being arrested Fuck it
It says more about the player it has little to do with money and more to do with character
his team managers are likely involved Just like Gerrard in Prime Its very unlikely to be a 1 man thing
Nope since it happens in every sport It s like the recent scandal in tennis and tennis is still a popular sport as far as I know What you say is totally unfounded and the fact that you are getting upvoted is kind of depressing The only thing it shows is the state of esport and match fixing in Korea And I don t think any game is spared
one thing s for certain KeSPA is not having huge success in preventing this kind of stuff to happen when sAviOr case happened they were very vocal that despite the damage done a zero tolerance policy was all they needed to prevent corruption from happening guess they were very wrong they should have worked in depth to eradicate bad habits and menaces at the source If it comes out a top SC pro can be easily blackmailed addicted to gambling and stuff it would mean the eSports organizations did not do enough to protect professional scene from these threats I wuould expect atleast some KeSPA representative to admit some kind of responsability for that
Does anyone have any matches that seem fishy or that could be potential evidence anecdotally I mean I can t think of too many matches off the top of my head where Life was beaten or lost in weird ways Maybe he s just that good In a bad way
The one some are pointing to was Life v Solar on Merry Go Round from 2014 Proleague don t know if it is though
The only thing that I can think of that would be remotely suspicious is Life vs Taeja at IEM where he accidentally detonated all his banelings twice It was the 100 000 take all and maybe he thought he wouldn t win the whole thing EDIT Maybe I m thinking of the wrong tournament but point is Life detonating all his banelings multiple times in the series is suspicious
With the arrest of Life zerg is no longer OP
If it s true then I don t get it He earned so much money from last 3 years that almost no SC2 pro did and only small percentage of adults can earn that much what reason can make you fix a match after having earned that much
Even Savior was at the top of the world when be was match fixing
Criminal gang pressuring your family or your life unless you throw a match
Mafia is everywhere Can I interest you in an anti mafia insurance
They say a man never really knows himself until his freedom s been taken away I wonder how well does he knows himself
He had all the tools He had many fans behind his back He has won it all and still doing this If he is guilty man fucking greedy piece of shit
If he is guilty it may not have been because of greed maybe it was take this cash to match fix or your family member is going to have an accident With the people that organise this kind of stuff who knows
So what s the law in Korea Jail or fines They will probably not punish him too harshly but dat criminal record though Hard to get jobs now
What confuses me by far the most is that life already made so much cash in winnings Why would he get into match fixing Maybe this entire thing is much bigger than we realize and there is a lot of people behind it that force players into match fixing idk by threatening or w e Ofc that doesnt make it right and im not trying to defend anyone here but I can just see no logical explanation for why a teenager that already makes hundreds of thousands of in earnings would risk his entire life just to make a couple bucks more Even if that was some serious cash I just dont see it being as simple as that edit now that I come to think about it with all the retirements lately in the KR scene maybe this is all related Maybe there is some Players retiring because they feel its the only way out of this who knows
Fuck this
Yay we re a real sport now
I feel ill
eSports isn t a real sport until it has the corruption of field sports
Maybe he got scammed out of financial motivation in life s case
Wow I don t really follow sc2 any more but I still remember how exciting Life was to watch play and how fucking amazing he was truly one of the best zergs of all time in sc2 arguably the best This would be crushing if it s true
I hardly follow Sc2 anymore and this is crushing news
If Life ended up match fixing It must ve been far higher than what he would normally make I guess there s no money in SC2 like there was in BW So much match fixing potentially even from the tournament winners
I m a bot bleep bloop Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit r games Ten time premier Starcraft 2 tournament champion Life arrested for match fixing x post r starcraft r pcgaming Ten time premier Starcraft 2 tournament champion Life arrested for match fixing x post r starcraft If you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and don t vote in the other threads Info Contact
So what forced him into accepting this Was the money just that good Or is eSports really that bad that one of the most prominent korean SC2 players felt the need to take money for a fixed match
Unfortunately the crowd mentality in Korea is very much guilty until proven innocent maybe Many Korean celebrities accused of misdeeds have had their reputations ruined forever even after they were found totally innocent One example off the top of my head was the controversy over Tablo graduating from Stanford
coda cloud kingdom day break neo Planet s yeonsu ohana terraform loved them all so much
Rip in peace Cloud Kingdom your sharks will fly forever
Ohana means family
Ohana is what made me hate Protoss
Do you even Yeonsu
Some people play Yeonsu some watch Avilo some get DT rushed on their first game For me it was Ohana
I love that you mention neo planet S It wasnt in the map pool for long and didnt have a huge impact like king sejong or ohana but it was definitely one of my favorite maps This was back in the SH era and it was one of the few maps that was both difficult to split in half and didnt have 1 central pathway to all 4 5 bases on the map That made for some fun games and made SH a lot less obnoxious
It is one of my favorite maps of all time Now that I think of it maybe part of it was the snow All the terrain is similar now
What all those maps have in common that the current maps in the pool don t have is they re all created by users while the current map pool is entirely done by Blizzard
Then maybe in the near future community maps will make it into the map pool again and the past map glory can be relived in this new era I mean community maps weren t you used for the game immediately before anyways right Took time for that to happen Or maybe community maps can be used for the standard entries in the pool and Blizzard can make the fun and new maps
Unfortunately there is no TeamLiquid Map Contest in sight There is a Blizzard call for player made maps but it explicitly asks for creative maps it also gave 2 weeks to make those maps which is way too short Even if a map makes it through it will take untill at least Season 3 before any get implemented But as it looks now no regular player made map entering ladder is anywhere in sight Unless there is a sudden change in mindset of tournament organisers and Blizzard it will probaly stay that way for quite a while
don t forget Frost
Yeah Frost is one of those maps that were instantly loved
I can never read Neo Planet S normally in my head it s being read by the smash bros announcer NEO PLANET S
I really miss King Sejong
I loved some of those maps but Yeonsu was pretty terrible in TvP after a while though WAY too much access to the main back in late 2013 early 2014 when blink Stalkers ruled the matchup
what about bel shir vestige i loved that map
Man I never liked daybreak The rest of them where great indeed
Overgrowth was pretty unique tho offensive gold spinerush lingflood all in was my favorite zvp build there
That s a good point maybe it s because it seems like Blizzard is equating unique with gimmicky when it comes to new maps that I m remembering it as standard
I loved so much that map It was one of the most balanced we ve ever seen No blink abuse possible not too wide open to drops nat not to wide open ez wall
I really like that you could siege the natural really well made map
I was terrified to take a third as protoss Lings would delay the expo two or three times Early mines were pretty good too
It was unique in a good way Not the current bs we have
it still had that X Factor I want more maps like Overgrowth but I don t think Overgrowth was necessarily every other map Not to say that standard maps aren t good or fun and if that s what most people want then it is definitely something that should be brought up and discussion should be encouraged as it is here Personally I like unique maps because they produce unique games as a player I enjoy this because my favorite thing about the game is the strategy bit Blizzard might think along the same lines but ultimately we should always try to find a middle ground that pleases most of our audience and players without alienating the rest if we can help it there are 7 maps available at a time so good middle grounds in something like a map pool shouldn t be too difficult to reach
My problem with a lot of unique maps is the uniqueness is generally only consistency exploitable by only one side of a matchup That builds in a handicap of sorts for one side of a game and that makes games on those maps less interesting to be The original ramp on Daedalus Point was unique but watching protoss play with a massive inherent disadvantage vs zerg was not fun or interesting gameplay
Cloud Kingdom
Do you know about the secret cannon spot
Christ that keyboard
love how hyped Destiny gets hahahah
Antigua shipyard I loved that map so much to me it was some kind of abandoned trading post in firefly Current maps have no character like that
Me too not just because it actually looks like something out of Firefly People complained about how hard it was to get a 4th but I was just a noob Plat Protoss and I could get that 3rd so easy then just A move my Blink Stalker Colossus deathball across the map Good times
Habitation Station King Sejong Station Frost damn I m even Jonesing for Expedition Lost that s how bad things have gotten
Same here but for Coda and Frost
Same here but for Akilon Wastes and Cloud Kingdom
Same here but King Sejong Station
KSS one of if not the best 2 player map in SC2 history Honourable mention for habitation station
If we had to go full League and only play one map forever it would be King Sejong Station
I miss all the good games on Frost Symbol vs InnoVation or Heart vs XiGua was one of my favorites
check out Maru VS Dear on Frost oh baby Oh and nobody cares but my most missed maps are 1 KSS 2 Overgrowth 3 YEONSU BABY
Oh I forgot about that Dear s my favorite players and any series that involve him and Maru back in 2013 is so good I just wish we get some good standard macro maps again
Belshire anyone just me ok
omg I miss that map so much
Catalena coda take me back
Whats the problem With unique maps you can use other builds than on standart maps Whats the point of 7 same maps So you only have to study 1 build With different maps you can have a different build for every map
That s true but then we have maps like Prion Terraces and it s hard to see if units are imbalanced or the map is And then if you want to balance something around one two maps it might break the balance on different maps If you understand what I mean
Yes i understand that but if thats the main point then there should be only 1 map around which the game is balanced and every other map that differs would be at least a little bit unbalanced Maybe there shouldnt be any map on which one race is favored but there should be more different unique balanced maps in which other builds are used to Else there is no point in having more than 1 where every game looks the same Imagine there would be a map with no ground connection and only air for example That would be pretty sick and new Ofc it should be balanced for all races
Which is really really hard to do
I think OP s use of Overgrowth illustrates the point most people are trying to make perfectly Overgrowth allowed players to engage in a massive breadth of play with the forward gold offering all kinds of unique play styles while still giving players that preferred standard maps what they liked A truly great map is one where a game can play out standard or straight up bizarre based on how the players choose to play not how the map shoe horns them into playing The problem with prion terraces Ulrena and Central Protocal isn t that they are unique its that they are just straight up bad Instead of trying to patch fixes etc we need to move on and find our next Overgrowth
Variation is ok but only with in a certain degree The maps we have now are too varied
Unique maps force you to use certain builds on them Standard maps don t limit you as much On standard maps some people are lazy and don t vary their builds but the maps do not tie you to doing only one build they merely make it possible to play that way Nonstandard maps like Prion force you to play very specific builds in specific matchups and are ultimately more limiting
I miss many standard maps but overgrowth had to die It had unnaturally long life which continued in Korean cups even after it was removed from ladder
Because it was such a good map along with KSS
Overgrowth never forget RIP
Had such a high win percentage on that map FeelsBadMan
I think Overwatch was the best map of SC2 so far I really can t think of another that could compete
I miss Antiga and Daybreak T T
Overgrowth was an amazing map People did get sick of it because it stuck around for so long but it was so balanced If they ever do another dream pool I hope we see it again
I want Antiga Shipyard back c
Blizz wants UNIQUE maps e g Maps with all GOLD bases Main Base with Huge OPEN RAMP MAin with BACK ROCKS ON 3 SIDES
Whirldwind anyone
Oh yeah the cannon rush on your natural with the powering pylon on the third was a delight to play against I hated overgrowth for this thing only Otherwise great map
I agree with a lot of the maps people say they missed but to be honest those maps were never on the same pool to begin with Many of them were years apart even Most map pools had one or two maps that people really liked while the rest were considered bad or just not memorable I can t remember a time when the community was happy with the map pool overall
Why think fondly of the most boring and over exposed map of all time Keep the game fresh and keep maps diverse to force different strategies and experiences
Holy fuck yes
one of the best maps of all time for sure I really hope Blizzard realizes that maps can be unique without having some gimmick i e gold 3rd base
FUCK YES I COMPLETELY AGREE I MISS OVERGROWTH Edit ALL THESE MAPS SUCK ASS
I too loved OG but remember how much people were ranting at it for being too old too standard and shit The community killed it
I feel like there really should be a huge discussion about the korean scene as a whole at this point You have to remember that these kids join esport teams before they are adults probably even neglecting any education for the most part They live in the team house training countless hours and don t even get a decent salary unless you are the superstar I am not surprised that such an environment would create matchfixing not saying that ONLY in these circumstances matchfixing is a problem but it certainly helps Obviously in Life s case this doesn t fit the picture but if we believe other statements Rekrul some foreign progamers there is a lot more shady stuff going on beyond the surface Nobody ever talks about the questionable enviroment though i feel that should change Maybe i misrepresent the whole thing with this post if i do so pls correct me but that s what i feel atm
This probably has a whole hell of a lot more to do with Korean society in general than it does with just the Starcraft 2 scene The fact that illegal gambling rings can operate so boldly says a lot Life could lose his entire career loads of his earnings and will probably have a tough future ahead of him Where is the talk about the brokers and the gangsters facilitating this to happen so frequently and so blatantly Children are frequently offered thousands of dollars by adults and the children who accept lose everything As a side note life is only 19 years old Did you understand what 500k meant when you were that age Also he s still living in a team house in less than ideal conditions for a normal life so it s not like he s living the life of someone earning 100k year That money must be so abstract to him if he even still has it
I don t know about Korean culture specifically but in most Asian cultures it s expected common that you pay back your parents in one way or another Depending on how much you earn it s pretty much a given that you pay some sort of allowance to them until you re married I d be surprised if most progamers didn t pass along a large portion of their earnings winnings to their parents I don t think Life kept the 500K for himself
It s a given Look at MC MVP and all the big name players What do they do with all that money Goes straight to their parents or at least a significant chunk of it Here in America yeah it s a lot more about me me me mo money mo money mo money But in Korea the respect towards your elders is deeply ingrained The culture is enormously different and something I dare say many Americans wouldn t really understand
Illegal stuff happens all over the world man You can t blame korea for having a illegal gambling scene It s entirely Life s fault that he decided he wants to be a part of it
So your point is that they shouldn t bother trying to improve conditions or go after the illegal gambling rings I assume this just means gangsters because it s entirely up to 19 year old life to push away their demands for his entire career Great
I m not saying they shouldn t fight against illegal gambling rings Just that it s 100 Life s fault and not theirs Let s take the war on drugs as an example Gouverments are fighting them but it s just not as easy as you make it seem And yeah it s the fault of a 19 year old if he decides to take drugs and not the dealers gouverments edit Actually players like Life are the ones that create the illegal matchfixing scene Not the other way around And it s not because progamers have a a hard life Life is a superstar and probaly made more money than any other 19 year old It was pure greed that lead Life into the illegal scene
You don t have any insights in the case How can you get to such conclusions We know nothing about the case we don t know If they preasured him into doing the match fixing At this point we are in no position to put all the blame on someone the whole thing too complex to be put down this easy I don t know anything about the gangs u Throwawayaccount 047 is writing about And I don t think that the Korean administration is NOT fighting them
Illegal gambling is just one of those things which seems to come hand in hand with organised crime It is an assumption but one based on examples from many other countries and of course wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki Crime in South Korea
You don t understand u throwawayaccount 047 s point It s hard to put all the blame on someone who probably doesn t really understand how much 400k really is because he lived all his young adult life in a gaming house and have not known what living alone paying for your stuff is like It s also the State s concern that its population doesn t turn into criminals or in this case illegal gamblers or match fixing athletes It s not their responsability if it happens but it becomes theirs too when they let it happen
yea let s blame the fucking kid because he obviously thought yay i wanna be a part of this Teenagers being bet on winning and losing at an international game with thousands of dollars at stake that does not fucking happen everywhere and obviously in Korea it is attracting the attention of criminal groups who have professionals that know how to fucking convince a kid As if this is the hardest thing they had to do
If he did engage in match fixing you really have no idea what the stakes and rewards were He very well could have been more than happy to accept deals depending on how much money was involved and his disposition towards the game You don t know him neither do I and neither of us understand the situation The world isn t as ethically and emotionally simplistic as your favorite anime Life the person is probably more complex than its 1 dimensional protagonist Nineteen is young but it s old enough to understand risk and consequence
Look I don t know you don t know but it is more than likely that a lot of manipulation was involved heck this happens to be even true on car deals and imagine now what gangsters can do He had no reason to accept the deals with the amount of money he was making
I honestly disagree I think we re probably both American and grew up with totally different environmental and societal pressures on us The choice was less his than it would have been ours had it been offered to us in America at that age
I m sure when the full details come out we ll hear about the others involved Remember the whole Prime thing In the full report it mentioned the people involved that weren t from the sc2 scene and they got punished pretty hard I think The community will obviously focus on the sc2 players involved but I don t think it s correct to say that people aren t talking about the gangsters that are involved
where did that large number even come from
the air i dont even know how anyone knows the reason for his arrest why would the police release that to the public
what needs to change is the atittude of programers that they need go in to a team house and should dedicate the entirity of their life to starcraft 2 starcraft 2 can be so depressing to watch when you think about the horrible life prospects of the players especially when they lose a match
we actually can t tell how the match fixing is done how s the approach on the players what pressure they receive what promises are told I don t know man for guys like Yoda and BB I kinda understand easy money easy way but Life
My point is that the korean scene seems kinda shady even without matchfixing if you think about it Kids join proteams and don t even get a decent salary for it I mean you could argue that they get exploited In Life s case this is less of a motivation because he is a big superstar in the context of sc2 but overall i can definitely see WHY some of these guys feel the need to earn some extra money The whole scene doesn t feel stable and respectable when you look at it this way As i said i am sorry if i misrepresent the environment somebody with more knowledge someone closer to it can definitely correct me
We can even look into other countries in that region when it comes to practise environments This things is Not a esport thing I would more say its more of a Hierarchy where young minds become products of persons with interests extreme example but point made
Well i am not saying this is exclusive to korean esport but i hardly see anyone discussing it Which is wrong imo
What would you want to achieve with talking about it Just curious
Hashtag activism lets talk about something over which we have no control or impact so we feel better about ourselves
I simply think it s always better to discuss problems instead of sweeping it under the mat It probably won t change anything though i get that
Well said Chobra StarCraft is a wonderful lovely thing and it s disappointing to see all the bad news and negative vibes lately
It is a lovely game But for those who wish to view it as a career it is indubitable that this news will weigh heavily on whatever few that is
It is both my career and Chobra s so I think that sense may be a little overblown
You are already in it an invested party For you to fight on would be a consequence of your commitments and unyielding stance For a prospective amateur or less unwavering enthusiast the situation is bound to differ
Maybe The news is unfortunate but even in a worst case scenario Starcraft will survive this pretty easily imo
We have statements like this but we are still not sure if Life is really guilty or not Am I right
He s been brought in by the official police It s very very likely he ll be convicted
esports police Constable Artosis
Kespa has investigated match fixing before by themselves this is far more serious
It s crazy that criticism would have almost 2 different meanings that would both apply here I like the second one better you like the first one better that s fine crit i cism krid siz m noun 1 the expression of disapproval of someone or something based on perceived faults or mistakes he received a lot of criticism synonyms censure condemnation denunciation disapproval disparagement opprobrium fault finding attack broadside stricture recrimination More 2 the analysis and judgment of the merits and faults of a literary or artistic work alternative methods of criticism supported by well developed literary theories synonyms evaluation assessment appraisal analysis judgment More
I think it s interesting the way that official definitions mutate based upon a consistent usage Both definitions could certainly apply and I don t believe the sentence would particularly change The first definition explicitly conveys negativity while the second and original definition as far as I know became so associated with negativity it created the first While it s mostly inconsequential additional definitions seem unnecessary in these situations The example sentence he received a lot of criticism shows the ridiculousness of the first definition Receiving a lot of criticism implies negativity because one may be less likely to provide advice pertaining to an already strong work piece idea etc It is difficult to improve upon good and generally easier to understand and convey the faults of a mediocre or sub par thing whatever that thing may be It s like the often complained about recent redefinition of the word literally The redefinition to mean in effect virtually is unnecessary because the word used in this regard with intentional hyperbole The meaning of the word has never changed and in fact its use as a non literal expression relies on its definition as being exact otherwise the phrase has no potency or comedy What s annoying is that the first definition of criticism adds unnecessary redundancy to my post A mocking criticism is a judgement or analysis that is intended to be mocking and is therefor an expression of disapproval Anyways fun observation gg
well yeah my point was the sarcasm and mockery are only critical in a negative way I could take nothing constructive and be better for it from it it was just for the sake of offending
I hope so he s my favorite player and has been for years
Same here hope he comes out clean however unlikely it may be starting to seem
There isnt a big reason for that hope At the moment he is at the same spot as 4B and Yoda They havent been at a curt when we all called them matchfixers but a prosecutor had enough evidence to bring it to court and KESPA called them out 98 of the prosecutors files are won in front of courts Life is in prison the evidence must be really solid or else you dont get arrested and treated like that in Korea There is a reason why statements like this are brought But just like Yoda and 4B the evidence is so pressuring that he sits in prison and looks very grim It is the right moment for such statements even they wount help in the decline
It s B4 not 4B
Doesn t matter Kespa have a 0 tolerance policy on this The moment you are arrested you can t participate any Kespa sanctioned event
go play some sc2 sc2 community nah too stressful i just watch
Even tho I know that he s right I still feel horrible about this sAviOr used to be one of my favorite players back then and this strikes an awfully familiar note Right now I just want to cry Life heh will go on but not right now
I m glad chobra wrote this I certainly needed to read it I m glad he s still active in the scene
It s not like he died lol
He may as well have
ma bonjwa is dead to me
Guys do we have Brendan Dassey in custody Can we pin this one on him too Just this once
I m not caught by shock and awe about this news and it s not cause I always suspected Life It s just simply that it can happen to anyone How the fuck can it happen to anyone To get caught Or to be a match fixer
Both Match fixing exists in esports way more than we actually know Very few get caught though
My point was that it can t happen to anyone And it s absurd to say it can It besides the point how much get caught because if you don t accept the bribe you will not be in a position to get caught And to absolve Life with a saying it can happen to anyone is that real life pun intended
if you don t accept the bribe you will not be in a position to get caught Maybe the people offering the bribe dont take no for an answer if you know what I mean They are hardly playing by the law kind of guys in the first place
If you think that this is a take no for an answer situation you are living in a ferry tale moooooseknuckle i wasn t referring to his gilt or innocence but the comment that it could happen to anyone that i found funny and not true
The point isn t to absolve him If he s innocent he ll be back If he s guilty then he s gone and will be penalized accordingly There s no need to dwell on him just move on
There have been various match fixing incidents in different games SC2 is hard to matchfix on because you have to do it for cash in other more popular games kappa you can bet skins and various items therefore getting a quick reward You can do it in many ways without ever getting caught One very popular incident that happened was the IbuyPower controversy in CS GO Google it It s just one of the many that have happened and yet very little have been found because it s incredibly easy to cover your tracks when you re match fixing The only reason that incident went public is because an angry ex gf of a player spilled the beans on twitter about it all If it was not for her we would ve never known
I m sure when the full details come out we ll hear about the korean scene as a whole at this point
Good read Gonna hit that ladder New Season hype
I have to say that even if Life is matchfixing I ll remember his beautifull plays and I will always respect the skill that he has shown fake or not I m maybe overly positive or it is maybe just that I don t really care about matchfixing what I mean is that I m only in the scene through the game reddit and the tournaments that I am watching and the fact that Life has matchfixed is not a big deal for me because it has not destroyed my previous experiences related to sc2 I hope to see a skilled Life on LOTV and if not I hope that a zerg as skilled as him takes his place and contributes to my enjoyment
He s still one of the best zergs in the world if not the best Choosing to fix matches assuming he actually did was a shitty thing to do but that doesn t diminish his skill as a player I agree hopefully the charges will be dropped and he ll come back or else hopefully someone else steps up and takes his place
Yeah it s kind of retarded how some people say it shows the state of the scene I mean there is this kind of scandal everywhere in every large sport or esport It s sad but it happens The issue is that this kind of situation seem to happen more often in Korea
I wish he had something interesting to say
Watch a movie Build a snowman Go to the beach
right on Chobra
It s kind of brilliant actually Life always wins except when he deliberately loses
Brood war was fun to play and watch Starcraft 2 is absolute shit
he always suspected Life uhh
This reads like he always suspected Life but that s not the reason he isn t caught in shock and awe I am no native speaker though so maybe i am wrong Either way he surely didn t mean it that way

I don t think that s how he meant it
Day9 trumpets
Day9 Reactor dance is pretty good too
Special tactics
Thanks for the context
This was just the beginning White ra had a TLO esque penchant for weird protoss timing attacks and really became known for special tactics in WoL It was a great meme
We make expand and then defense it
ARtosis pylon and HuK to 3 control should go much further
These were actually all polls voted on by the community
team liquid net is known for their extensive use of memes
Thread can be found here If you disagree then you disagree with the people who voted not OP http www teamliquid net forum starcraft 2 321344 over tl esports bracket
Ya the TB hat makes no sense I mean I love the guy but there was never much of a meme revolving around his hat Let alone a meme which would top the tosis pylon
I hear people say artosis pylon very regularly Never heard someone say TB s top hat
I only ever associated it with his twitter pic Didn t know he actually ever wore one
he stopped somewhere in 2012 long after the esports bracket happened TB has a bigger fanbase than artosis so obviously hes gonna be voted higher
Poopfeast420 is way better than special tactics lets be real
Trumpets for life oh the memories
Artosis Pylon out in the first round Heresy
That s what happens when you have an artosis pylon All it takes is one thing to go wrong and you re out
who voted for these and why isn t poopfeast420 the winner

I miss Idra Rage It was so entertaining to watch
We should make a new version of this
Nothing can ever beat Unimpressed Flash
I was wondering where Unimpressed Flash is but when I read your comment it made sense After all what would be the point of this competition if the winner was predetermined Better exclude it and let the others compete
How does day9 s trumpet beat Huks top 3 control This is a fallacy of the truth
Turns out Day9 trumpets is top 2 control
That s fucking great we need some more
Wow shouldn t reddit pitchforks be the winner
Oh god i completely forget the CHILL GET OUT moment

Idra rage should have won at least it lost to the eventual winner
poopfeast420 will be 1 in my heart always 3
This is excellent but could definitely be updated
a few of these aren t exactly memes but just things that happened Still pretty hilarious 1
poopfiest420 is propably my personal favorite
The Banjo was the best IMO
I just wish we at least got a couple new maps I don t care if they are standard crazy or imbalanced I just want some new maps to play on A few of these maps will have been around for like a year by the time this season ends and it gets boring playing on the same maps over and over again
Can you imagine playing Frost LE King Sejong Station or any other standard map for a year That would be so cool but it will never happen
What godly maps
I wonder how metropolis would fare today Not to be confused with Metalopolis Or even Heavy Rain or Polar Night GSL Crux Red City or Iron Fortress Always wanted to play Fruitland and Bel shir Beach on ladder So many good games to watch i never played them against anyone T T
BringBackWhirlwind
Completely agree Might even un veto those I hate just to mix it up a little Would be more fun if they brought in separate MMR per race what happened to that idea
I just want old maps I really miss Metalopolis and Shakuras plateau
Bye Diamond hello Plat FeelsBadMan
I got GM and faced mostly high Diamond players my dreams of getting GM twice are nonexistent
Wait GM is open already O o
Oops I meant last season
Oh phew I was about to stay up all night laddering trying to get GM Thanks for the update
The game says GM starts 31st Jan which is today but Im sure its just another bug or mistake from Blizzard
Its a mistake GM is always 1 week after the season roll
Almost everyone starts new seasons in a lower league than your mmr since they stopped do mid season demotions
Oh yea I know it was just a joke since most people do just drop a league for the first few days of the season
Live on EU as well
the lack of any new maps seriously hurts I don t buy their weird passive aggressive damage control post this is straight up lazy and it s a dereliction of literally the most basic element of managing the SC2 multiplayer experience
Here we go GL HF everyone
I got insta demoted to diamond from masters Last season I was regularly getting matched vs GM and winning some of the time I was in the high 400s rank wise on nios kr on NA Wtf
Incentive to play Fuck that means I ll probably have to regrind back to masters too edit nope I m good
The system always places very conservatively You ll be back to masters in a few games
Did anyone else get their highest season finish last season and it s not updating on their profile
Relog
thx
What was the last season I swear mine didn t update even after a re log
live in eu too
Best Blizzard Season 1 2016 Quote We re working on a variety of improvements under the covers From the Back End section of David Kim s post http us battle net sc2 en forum topic 20419654340
I thought it will start at 1st february
Judging by this news post from a few days ago at least one person at Blizzard did as well http us battle net sc2 en blog 19995564 2015 ladder season 4 has locked 1 26 2016
Wait what it s the same maps Zzz
Wow awesome still this shitty mappool no ladder improvements zero motivation for 1vs1 ladder Good job BlizzardSC2 you guys are just a big disappointment Rushing lotv without addressing all the multiplayer issues combined with not even providing new and solid maps will definitely help with the continuous stagnation of sc2 It s sad but true guys
If you need someone else to motivate you to play that is your own problem Don t blame Blizzard
WTF The motivation is generated by the game itself obviously For me personally i have played long enough on ladder with this bad and non transparent division hidden mmr system They have announced to bring a ladder revamp soon after lotv release along with some other new features and now they don t even adapt the worst map pool in sc2 history Just lol
So you have played his game for a while Yet you say something as patently wrong as worst map pool ever Come on man Be honest and stop being a flaming cry baby As for the game requiring to motivate you instead of you motivating yourself This isn t kindergarten Your mom might have had to motivate you to study and work hard back then but you should have learned to motivate yourself by now Did they promise all this cool new stuff shortly after launch No They did not They just said after launch and then we all hoped it was going to be fast Some things came quicker than expected karax and mission and some slower ladder update They have to be given time to work Even with a good sized team they have a lot on their plate You should be able to tell that even without the community follow up from David If you couldn t then his post should show that Also add they are still working on the Nova campaign at the same time Stop crying and play the game Or don t Either way stop moaning
Your poor logic does not argue in your favour and you won t discourage people from expressing their critique here
r starcraft has a message for me
3 thank you for being a good sport about it
I know right he s pretty much Football Would suck if he was a bad sport like basketball
When you don t have anything meaningful to say in an internet debate you can always default to finding fault in your opponents grammar Stay classy Reddit

Don t ask what David Kim can do for you ask what you can do for David Kim
Well maybe people are sick of saying NERF PYLON OVERCHARGE for like 3 months now
i dont think pylon overcharge is even OP i just think it is a silly game mechanic same for tankvacs i feel like theyre changes youd make in an arcade map for fooling around theyre just so ridiculous
I ve heard there s a new terrain unit with a mop and cleaner that walks around and cleans up creep but then the floor is slippery so Marines can t walk on it
Not nerf remove
Precisely the kind of retarded crap we must contrust against
sounds like non contrusive feedback
eh I dunno I think it has a place and it helps protoss deal with harassment which they really struggled with before It just shouldn t be able to defend any attack before the 20 minute mark Weaken it and make it less spammy
They need to nerf that OR adepts not both This just makes toss early game shit again
You mean to tell me not being able to expand and having to spend gas on sentries while terran and zerg safely expand and harass with tier 1 units wasn t ideal
oh no do you have to build units to defend your expansion why cant pylons just do it all
Why can t stalkers cost 50 minerals with tier 1 upgrades that make them 2x 3x as good
Because a stalker is way way stronger than a marine
David Kim has the patience of a saint There s no way I could deal with the 1000 s of gold league heroes thinking they understand the game and know EXACTLY what needs to be changed
I want you To take balancing seriously Edit This thread is 100 separate from the balance feedback So the comment that has points below me makes no sense whatsoever This was also a joke SC2 reddit is unreal
You are one of the people whose feedback is so uncontrustive that you only make the job harder
Whoosh
How does that make any sense at all when I am not even giving feeback on any of the balance changes This thread has nothing to do with the feedback for the game whatsoever so what are you actually getting at And obviously my comment was a joke
Your post implied that he doesn t take balancing seriously It was a clear and direct criticism of David Kim ergo it was a criticism of his balance changes along the line of You aren t taking the changes you make seriously Unless you intended it differently in which case you should have written it differently
It was a joke that wasn t even near the feedback thread or post Get real
If you don t understand what you yourself say then don t say it
Take a joke Stop taking things so seriously It s just the internet Don t worry about what I said D
I wish the mods banned dumbfucks like you from this subreddit

deleted
Can you rewrite this in English please
No new maps for you
What uncostructive feedback he is talking about Sorry not following the game lately But when I was leaving Kim had kind of shitty reputation and it wasn t completely undeserved Does that changed
You weren t listening to us back in 2010 Our patience has ended Hope you re happy what you did to our game Because we aren t
Hey David what about analyzing DATA as hard evidence instead of listening to peoples rant Yunno doing your job
Should have gone with Alarak and been more assertive
Well it s not like Blizz is doing anything we expect them to do like new maps leave league bugs other stuff blizz promised
Honestly they should be thrilled that they re getting so much free feedback regardless of positive negative Some businesses have to pay a fortune to understand customer sentiment and DK s team get it for free then complain about it If they don t have the infrastructure in place to filter it and separate signal from noise and or it s causing poor morale that s entirely the responsibility of their management teams not the customer s problem Insinuating that their recent minimal efforts to have some dialogue with the community aka transparency are to fault for unrealistic expectations and not the fact that Blizzard themselves hyped these features is laughable Asking the community of paying customers to lay off on their harmful internet words was pathetic and frankly just came off as more PR intended to obfuscate the fact that Blizzard s focus isn t really on this game although they continue to pay it lip service If what we re seeing really represents the efforts of a full team I don t know what to say The right response when your customers complain en masse is to say that you totally understand where the complaints are coming from will make every effort to expedite changes the community wants but make no guarantees and then proceed in the best way forward for the business after understanding the cost benefit of addressing the user complaints ahead of your slated development calendar Unfortunately it looks like Blizzard s cost benefit analysis is consistently falling on the side of less investment in SC2 but taking passive aggressive shots at the community is weak regardless
He is the worst thing to ever happen to starcraft
Why is that As someone who doesn t follow this very closely I d be interested to read a nice write up
Oh Fuck off
He hasn t had a mind for balance in a decade He made a few good suggestions in sc1 but that s it
you re not mildly funny you re completely unfunny
I actually found that quite funny
I wish i had a job where i ask other people to do it for me
here is additional constructive feedback give us ghost skin for nova now pls I pre bought only reason is because of skin I don t care about the campaigns I shit you not I want to rush protoss with female ghost bitchs david kim pls
English pls
he sucks
Sorry but this game is balanced by front page reddit threads not actual numbers P players need to whine harder if they want a playable race
PvT 277 242 53 37 PvZ 386 438 46 84 TvZ 360 333 51 95 copy pasted from aligulac from most recent
But that being said please don t become whiners y all It s so pointless and demeaning when people whine at every drop of the dime Not only does it make those of us who still come here die inside a little each time we do it wastes the time of the devs who have to sifting through all of that crap in their quest to find constructive feedback
Looks like we have no choice I want a playable race man
This this this this this this this
Why does it always go this way When PvT was protoss favored the entire frontpage was filled with these nonsense posts But when it s terran favored no one bats an eye This is ridiculous and the terran bias is sickening Protoss players really got to stand up and whine more maybe we need an avilo of our own
Since patch 1 3 except for a very brief dip for the HotS release I don t see this graph go below 45 for PvT while it does appear to hit 55 twice Anything in the 47 to 53 range should be expected The ways you won TvP such as SCV pulls and the ways you lost TvP too many to list made the game unfun to play There is a difference between not having fun because you lose and not having fun because you had to do a checklist of things of every game or else you lose
It s kind of funny how Protoss players are whining more about Terrans whining about their 49 TvP than they whine about their own 41 PvZ And you can almost argue that the former is a bigger problem to whine about anyway
Why is that shocking Terrans were making out that TvP was unwinnable and that Protoss was broken as fuck when in fact when if you surivied past the early shit Protoss had an almost impossible army to fight against bio with tanks and liberators It seemed so outrageous how much complaining they where doing because it was from notable figures and all over Reddit to a level that Protoss never has That it rubbed a lot of Protosses like me the wrong way ZvP is fucked but then that seemed obvious and making ultras and lurkers basically invincible seemed like something they would ofc fix but no Well GGWP Reddit and Terran pro s alike I just hope a Protoss wins no other tournaments for fear of more nurfs
This reddit has far more terrans than protoss Just watch the votes on this post
You re right but I m not sure whether to upvote or downvote you
It s reverse psychology to get the terrans to give me karma Already working to the tune of about 2
please tell me the last time period when pvt was terran favoured
Month of January 2016 as statistics show
Pvz has never really been protoss favored not anymote than when the was Terran favored
also all of HotS after the widowmine patch

1 supply roaches come to mind when thinking of things more broken than broodlord infestor
Speed voidrays too Sweet jesus those were the days
Late game wasn t super prevalent in those days though
Beta
nah broken was when there were barracks before supply depots
I don t know why you are getting down voted Terran had a 33 wr vs zerg at the end of WoL It s not nearly as bad as the broodlord infestor days
WARHOUNDS
if you look at history part right now PvZ is 47 learn to use websites
No I also posted match statistics and tha graph is from beginning of January PvZ Is 46 8 from January 20 now so you do want the fork
Ya the graph hasn t been updated but you re right I m eating my words with a side salad right now tasty
And yet at high levels of play PtitDrogo wins Dreamhack over zerg and in Code A Protoss players are holding their own just fine in PvZ Also CJherO and Myunsik won both of the GSL preseasons herO beating world class zerg on the way In terms of actual gameplay Protoss has a lot of potential with phoenix into chargelot archon immortal They can also mix in warp prism adept harass which requires a very different reaponse from zerg than phoenix Somehow the stats say zerg is massively favored but it s not showing in top level gameplay or results
IMO The style that they use is just too hard for people below low master Yeah it is successful but demands a ton of multitask heavy macro even under pressure you have to always harass the zerg your phoenix can t be inactive more than 15 20 seconds PICA style and the only one that really works against zergs is really about having an excellent macro multitask to be successful And in the other hands zergs just go for roach ravager or lurkers without having to do anything but bases and drones But if you look at the GSL PvZ is 40 60 so there is still something wrong i guess And with the new PO nerf i would really like to see how korean pros handle early pools or even speedlings all in
Sounds like BW where if you could multitask like Bisu PvZ was easy
Except for when you get hydra busted
It isnt hard to execute Whats hard for lowbies is not running their entire army into lurkers and dying Its the same reason low ranks complain about disruptors all the time If you re not watch your army and dont preemptively position your units youlre gonna have a bad day
Well if you miss the harass part pressure presence on the map you won t be able to do anything
I think what you re saying is if you re can t put pressure on the map then the zerg runs rampant Or am I misinterpreting you If it is the above then ya I agree that keeping pressure on zerg is pretty hard as toss WPadept is helpful and will remain so but zerg s defensive capabilities are really strong with roachrava if it isn t any kind of multiprong harass or if the zerg has awesome creep spread
I don t say it s hard well i mean it is when you are mid master with 200 EPM If you can put some pressure on the zerg without letting your mineral reach 1k you are fine if you can t well you might get a little bit rekt IMO PICA is the only build efficient in the current meta macro build cuz as always all ins work quite well Phoenix opening to prevent muta i won like 20 games this season just by doing the double stargates opening because a lot of zergs are going fast muta without scouting the protoss because they are expecting some kind of zealot immo or adept immo all in And anyway now mutalisks are just way too scary to handle without a fleet of phoenix Archons for aoe vs speedlings and ultras and they are effective versus anything anyway cuz of their biologic bonus damage Immortals to annihilate roaches ravagers but you need sentries as well in the mid game and prevent or immediately kill the ultras Chargelots to kill the rest and you need to warp a lot of them in the zerg base while you are fighting with your main army again multitask With some storms and tempests for bullshitlords transition this seems to be the best composition you can get in PvZ But like i said you need a really good an excellent even to get that out in time and multitask to not let the zerg spread You must have a total control of the game I quite like this matchup because you really have to scout constantly to know where the zerg is going to get your extra robots stargates in time etc But early pools or speedlings all in are a real cancer the maps pool is probably the biggest issue tho And PO nerf won t help x And btw zergs KR and EU don t have the same gameplay EU zergs are a lot more agressive than KR ones This is MY OPINION not a divine truth so just don t shit on me pls D
Templar tempest is really strong lategame vs BL corruptor viper Oracles are necessary sprinkled in and once you get the right composition just liter bases with cannons The lategame imo only suffers when you let hte zerg remax really quickly Tech switches always favor the zerg
I would say PICA is even broken It s just a lot of people die before getting there So zerg early aggression is as broken Not the best state to be in I m not sure how new PO changes it
With a good army control engagement it is But most of people just think that it is a A moving comp So when they play it they a move and lose and say zerg is OP anyway Without even trying to play it correctly
TBH chargelot archon immortal actually does pretty well when a moved against lurkers as long as it s not up a ramp and or through a choke The chargelots quickly spread and don t take much splash then the archons and immortals can safely and quickly deal huge damage to the roach hydra lurker I play mostly random in LotV and I m certainly not a very high level player I still win a good amount of PvZ by just a moving PICA at zerg and doing some minimal micro such as phoenix lifts guardian shield immortal targeting etc
Mmm I agree with the premise that CAI is a very a movey composition but I have fought similar fights with pre splitting focusing immortals on lurkers and general micro like that and some engagements I ve been pretty lazy with The difference is quite staggering if you don t do at least some micro
Hey I follow the scene off and on What is this PiCA style I m low master NA as Zerg so i know basics of the game and all just not sure what this term refers to Not entirely up on the current meta game really
Phoenix Immortal Chargelot Archon
Thanks
Sorry but Muta micro isn t exactly the same as phx micro please remember u need to individually pick up every thing you want to kill It requires a lot more from protoss also considering to warp in you need to look away from your phx do your warp in and then return to phx micro
Yeah but on the other part mutas are less tanky and you have to be more carefull with your mutas And maybe you didn t notice that but muta players also often individually click on their targets to make it more efficient And as Zergplayer you have to go back for injecting and creepspreading
Dude phoenix are paper and they die so fast to things like hydra
Well they are tankier than Muta They cost 25 more but have 50 more health I don t think it s fair to say that one is harder to use than the other They are both fragile and need to be babysat all the time
Compared to a critical mass of mutalisk phoenix are pretty underwhelming We will see with the new viper nerfs now though
Yeah and know imagin how fast mutas they and how much more carefull you have to be because of that
Still not as hard imo playing zerg is still alot easier right now especially in lower leagues
Its completely subjective and playstyle dependent Ive been playing random in diamond for a long time and i just rush psionic storm in pvz with a 70 winrate
Phoenix micro isn t any more difficult than Muta micro I understand where you are coming from but having to use an ability doesn t make things magically harder Both require constant babysitting and target firing Hint Setup rapid fire for Graviton Beam for an even easier time
Ok a couple things I don t think I m winning at all its just a straight up fact that protoss standard playstyle is currently more difficulty on average then zerg Don t worry about my games I never said I m having problems vs I m fine because I can multitasking and macro unlike most lower level player we are referring to I don t know anyone that uses rapid fire for grav beam and have never seen any pros use it The reason being you run into the same problem as using it on feedback it super ineffecint and could maybe work if you had a ton of phx and nothing but workers in a mineral line but if the zerg was smart he s gonna move roaches or ling around his workers and really mess you up Again you can fuk off with your git gud and try harder bullshit no matter how you look at it if you go mass Muta as zerg your going to have a easier time then going phx You know why low level players complain about Muta being strong still it s to hard to control phx while doing everything else to make sure you don t die to a ground push so they don t make them Throw in the fact you can stack injects now and zerg gets even easier when you lapse on Marco So please learn a thing or two about the races before you make judgment on them
Not really people often make the mistake that some races are easier to play than others but that s wrong it depends mostly on the playstyle You can t say race x is harder than race y without referring to a playstyle Because it s the playstyle which makes something hard or easier
it is kind of ridiculous how zerg can faceroll roach ravager while protoss has to work their ass off to even stand a chance Regardless of where the s end up this is just not fair It s a little reminiscent of PvT a while back when protoss just had to 1a more or less with the colossus deathball but terran really had to micro and macro their hearts out but more severe
If you look at the GSL Protoss is currently the most represented race in Code S If you include the qualifiers there are factors like no names and ex pros being bounced out by existing pros more in some matchups than others They don t all neatly cancel out
weren t the code S qualifiers pre patch before the MSC nerf 41 winrate is post patch
The patch hit on the 29th after code S on the 30th in Korea Not a single Korean tournament game has been played on the patch
There are alternatives for lower league players phoenixes arent really necessary to deal with lurkers which are the main problem for most protosses A really simple way to approach it is by going for an oracle opening with fast 3 bases into chargelot immortal archon then a moving into the zergs army with revelation on the lurkers Only requires basic macro and no micro needed I dont use phoenixes either because my protoss mechanics are still new and awkward making it hard to multitask while macroing well I cant say its enough at GM level since I m not there but works for me in masters offracing as protoss
You do realize aligulac counts like no games Bellow masters right
that s exactly why he s using it the game is balanced at the pro level first
PICA isn t that hard you can literally just amove with ICA Roach Ravager Lurker is harder to handel than ICA Protoss had harder unit comps in HotS like blinkstalker sentry And it s not like pheonixes are that essential in the midgame if you have your groundarmy out And things like heavy macro even under pressure harass etc etc are things which count for every race also depending on the playstyle Zergs also need to have excellent macro maybe a bit less multitasking but more good positioning etc etc You re implying that zergs have it way easier than p which is simply not true Especially ICA is one of the easier unitcomps protoss had in starcraft while the midgame for zergs is harder than ever I think it s more that Lurker and Ravager are so strong and easy to get But it s hard to changes something while protoss does quite well at the toplevel I think the best step would be changing the mappool and make it more protoss favored or at least not so zerg favored like this one and then taking from there
That s exactly what i am saying Protoss do extremely well at high level against zergs because they have the mechanics APM to do so I see a lot of Top master GM ruining zergs in PvZ with this build expect on Ulrena and Prion Cancerraces But below this level of play or without this build it s kind of zerg favored
Yeah and lower level zergs also don t have the apm mechanics of a higher level zergs so it s balances itself out And on lower level there are many things which are inbalanced just because they can handel it Adapts Overlord drops Force Fields Widow Mines are all things which are inbalanced below a certain level What you re essentially implying is that zerg is easier to play that s why they re so strong at lower levels But you have nothing to back this assumption up you just feel that zerg is easier to play
Remember that when you re playing in diamond MMR you re playing against diamond zergs You might not be as good at managing your phoenixes but the zergs will be proportionally worse at keeping the harassment under control as well
You can literally a move ontop of Lurkers with PICA and still win the fight as long as you engage reasonably well and use Graviton Hell if you didn t go Phoenix you don t even need to worry about Graviton and can still win the fight No other ground army in the game can a move Lurkers and get away with it
Well that s not totally true Unless the zerg is caught of guard it s kind of hard Using graviton on lurkers if kind of risky because there are hydralisks just under your phoenix and actually there is a bug that make lurkers insta burrow when they are dropped off the graviton beam when they are attacking and you pick them up when the graviton wears off they insta burrow and continue attacking like nothing happened You can t engage lurkers which are being defensive just impossible because they are well spread zergs amy is in arc and spores are just next to the lurkers So you have to go for the late game with Tempest and Templars But yeah if you catch the zerg in the middle of the map with a good concave and storms you have a really good chance But it s not a moving you have to prepare to engage and choose the right place Map like Dusk Tower are awful vs lurkers because there is not enough place to engage them properly
Yeah they are showing stats of foreign zvp where Protosses dont do Stargate into chargelot archon immortal Honestly Protosses that are bitching just refuse to copy the successful pvz strats from koreans for some dumb reason There is literally no reason not to open stargate phoenix it s the best opening by far for Protoss
PvZ is 42 in the GSL
This includes matches before Protosses learned how to play no While I do think Zerg is slightly favored in this MU from what I ve seen Protoss players just aren t abusing the right tools often enough
Well a ton of that is when adepts still 2 shotted drones larva in the early game before 1 and a lot of P s wins in that were either won or got a big lead because of early game adept rushes sooo yeah Expect PvZ to drop dramatically in GSL as well as across the board Early adept stuff was hiding how low the actually is
Adepts can still 2 shot drones Not being able to 2 shot larva is not a big deal because 90 of the time you are busy with drones Wanna bet that the win rates will go up from now on despite the PO nerf
My bad on the misinformation Still makes no sense that the winrates would go up PO change is definitely a nerf PvZ and the only slight buff toss got was to skytoss and that s probably not something that toss will be able to turtle into in enough games to affect the winrates much I think 2 shot larva matters some I see a lot of pros do it if they can t reach the drones at the time or if they think a bunch of roaches whatever are going to be made soon to defend etc
I bet 50 Imaginary Points they go down
This kind of shit is exactly why looking at the game is useless people will always see what they want to see to justify what they want to be true
I saw plenty of people try that very build at dreamhack to very limited success once the zerg players moved into lurkers more intelligently Once there were 8 to 10 of them with roach hydra support that comp melted like everything else
If you don t have the mechanics for it it s pointless
You want your easy a move win don t you
We want fairness aka amove wins just like zerg gets amove wins for the last 5 years
Fairness http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Premier Tournaments Protoss won more premier tournaments than Zerg and Terran combined in 2015 In 2014 they won seven premier tournaments in a row In late Wings Protoss even during the Broodlord Infestor era still managed to take nearly even tournament wins from Zerg So which it is Are you severely deluded or a troll
Meanwhile you just ignore that when counting winners runner ups it s zerg that has the most in 2015
Right Because runner ups certainly has as much bearing as winners
Exactly They just have 1 series between them and winning out of the 2 dozen they played to get to the finals
I was obviously being sarcastic Look at how many more wins the Protoss got out of ALL those b05 and bo7s and what have you But I know your debate style and how you attribute it all to coincidence Doesn t matter how implausible it all becomes There are no absolutes in this world But what is certain that by percentage and likelihood alone I am much more likely to be correct
Same goes for all the toss who complained about swarmhosts when they were basically unplayable in high level korean matches because korean protosses knew how to use a warp prism
As a zerg I actually find protoss especially opening phoenix pretty weak I almost never lose because I ve figured out what to do Alot of zerg s that I ve been watching don t do what I do They either try infestors which sucks or hydra lurker which sucks vs this as well or go corruptor which is I think the be st the response but they just defend with the corruptors Once I get 10 out I push the phoenix s back by attacking their bases Phoenix tickle me and since they re putting all their resources in zealot and immortal I pick off bases really easily If they move out by 8 30 which is what drogo was doing in dreamhack I already have a sizeable ling baneling army that crushes the size army that drogo would have And ultra cavern is already on the way by 8 30 so by resetting the army it s just too easy to kill protoss at this point One game this exact scenario happened and while he was trying to attack me my corruptors have killed three bases I just find the style insanely weak shrug Also I start greater spire so I can turn those 10 corruptors on the map into broodlords if I want a death army I d be curious to play better protosses But I ve done this vs top masters on NA and on korea
DAE anything besides Code S champs is shit gameplay Also GSL code S champs is shit gameplay if reddit doesn t like the players
When will r starcraft just accept that no one will ever be good at starcraft
Why would you bring up Code S when Dreamhack wasn t even equal to any group in the Code A qualifiers
Code S champd are shit gameplay too unless they were brood war champions
dae foreigners still be shit compared to korea
You can always cherrypick any player who is doing well in any meta and conversely cherry pick any player doing poorly in any meta I don t really follow the non Korean scene very closely so maybe there are things going on there that I don t see but it feels really suspect to draw any conclusions from anything you have cited
Maybe because it s a small sample of the best players Stats about central tendencies of appropriately sized samples
Everything you just said about pro players occured pre patch I think its best to wait a few weeks and see what happens iem tapei proleague gsl ssl but I dont think you can use matches from pre patch to back up your claims the overcharge nerf will probably have a result in a change in the matchup For example cj hero was taking pre 3 mimute 3rd bases in many of his macro wins vs zerg cant see that being possible with the new PO
You sort of misinterpreted what I meant I didn t mean the tactics of phoenix and warp prisms require different units speedling hydra work fine for both I meant the builds of phoenix and warp prism require different units If you try to drone up and go 3 base hydra as Curious did and Protoss does warp prism harass build instead of phoenix then you ll end up taking lots of damage before your hydras even come out If instead you make roaches early to be safe to WP adept then the phoenix will have map control and free harass for a long time Either way if you choose the wrong reaction as zerg you ll end up behind in both econ and tech compared to Protoss I don t want a big argument either because I m not trying to say that zerg is necessarily underpowered in the matchup just that it s actually pretty close to even Besides that game from Curious vs Classic is a perfect example of what I was talking about with PICA style working very well against zerg
And yet departure and dark already showed how to crush the fast third that is the only thing keeping that winrate above 40 Just wait for some more zergs to do it and 41 25
yeh that is the more correct approach look at what high level players are doing who have played loads of games are doing a zvp victory for zerg means a lot less bout balance if it is between two low tier players This is something that isnt accounted for in any of these stats that people keep slinging
dont forget that Neeb crushed violet and huk lost 2 3 to petraeus showtime wrecked firecake 3 0 and harstem 3 0d bly in the WCS something qualifier
Have one third of the playable races balanced at only the absolute highest levels of play is a serious problem given the fact that for 99 of players maining Protoss is completely unfeasible If anything they should be focusing on balance across standard levels of play because who actually cares about professional e sports in 2016
Dude the top level is the only level where balance matters If zerg is easier to play you will just be matched against zergs with less skill than you having even games and everyone is having fun
Oh yes lets nerf overcharge that def wont have big consuquences in the zerg match up
I think its necessary though Overcharge limits both races from pressuring protoss which is why you see them greedily taking 3 base and just throwing pylons down to defend Now protoss will have to use units as well as PO to defend which honestly could lead to some severe protoss losses But at least then they can buff other units to reel the matchups back into balance
And because blizzard only patch one incorrect thing every 4 months protoss will be unplayable for all of season 2
Well they released a few minor patches before this but for the most part 3 months isn t so bad
Explain why Protoss steamrolls Zerg in tournaments
And without it we can t hold any pressure at all nerfing it has made protoss unplayable at high levels
I think what people want is a nerf to the overcharge and a buff to something else At least some unit not a building Blizzard recognizes the great things from BW to include the lurker in LotV and understood Terrans were missing some sort of mobile space control spider widow mine for HotS I think with protoss everything lies with the stalker Singularity Charge from BW so dragoons increased range is so important Just like ling speed stim I m not saying that it should be included i just think an upgrade to increase the strength of toss core units should be made to allow for the mid game madness It is going to be difficult but i think this is where the answer lies Could be wrong though
I wouldn t go so far as to say unplayable It is definitely difficult to win in PvZ but that has a lot more to do with lurkers viper corruptor BL than anything imo Don t get me wrong rorava is a terrifying thing to deal with The fact that there are multiple timings means its not always easy to predict But I think that protosses will just have to find ways of pressuring earlier like with phoenix harass or immortal pressure with recall and maybe take a 3rd a bit later than normal to win games
Those stats are Pre patch means we needed those supidly greedy builds imo In return this will lead to nerfs for Zerg
This is before that too Should be fun to see a race finally get into 30 s winrates
When you stop to think about it holy shit Starcraft is so balanced 41 59 is the worst the game has ever gotten Shit in other games counters are so hard you often have 10 chance to beat your counter much less 41
Yup but it s not the current circlejerk so you never hear about that
This is always what made me love the game and stay loyal since I ve been a little kid Unfortunately many don t see it that way and it s been hard to get my friends into it
Other games don t have only 3 races What a horrible comparison
Well every race in sc2 have many units I is not 3 units or 10 it much more Do the math Kappa
The individual units themselves aren t supposed to be balanced against each other That s not how any of this works
Which just infinitely complicates things
That s just moving the goal post In any other case where counters are 10 they are talking about specific units heroes abilities No other game has a faction that has less than 10 Winrate vs another That s just not how any of this works and is the dumbest circlejerk this sub has thought of in a while Use a single other esports to make a counterargument I dare ya cuz it s not possible
So let s nerf Protoss two best things and give them no buffs BRILLIANT
To be fair the Adept nerf didn t affect PvZ that much The overcharge nerf is huge tho
It s really hard to compete with mass zerglings right now
The adept change doesn t affect that though The adept will always 2 shot a zergling no matter what upgrades either of them has
Honest question at what stage of the game Late game don t you have disruptors and colossi Early game adepts still kill zerglings in the same number of shots so can you make more units Also doesn t the overcharge change kill more zerglings faster
Disruptors are pretty bad vs lings
I could just be bad but I m remembering a game I played where the protoss had chargelots and immortals between his disruptors and my crackling ultras I couldn t get to his disruptors and it was GG Tasteless
Well if the lings get held up behind the Ultras that could be a problem but if the lings are up front and get all over his stuff it s very difficult to land a disruptor shot without killing plenty of your own units
Nobody makes colossus or disruptors these days Chargelot archon is what kills the lings Untill that adepts dont trade cost effectively with lings without the upgrades and making a wall is rather impossible given how greedy you must play
Zerg 2 base 20 25 drones then mass zerglings and maybe banelings You can t really string overcharges anymore so it s hard to make a wall and have a more than 4 adepts and a 2nd base before zerg has about 30 lings
The dmg change did nothing agaunst lings Adepts still trade poorly against lings enmasse Lings have 35 hp Adepts do 22 dmg Before they did 23 In both cases it takes 2 full attacks to kill a ling PO on the other hand was nerfed and due to its delay in attack lings are a bit better at engaging now Morevoer corrsive bile is more powerful againat PO defenses
If you feel adepts trade poorly versus mass lings your either severly outnumbered because of terrible macro and or really mismicroing your adepts because adepts are basically 1 roaches for 25 more minerals and 1 roaches 2 shotting zerglings is practically a free win in zvz In pvz I do tend to defend adept attacks with zerglings because roaches don t do damage fast enough to adepts and adept attacks are all about trying to kill drones so faster killing adepts is more valuable but if I am anticipating a medium to large adept attack I always need to have an emergency bane nest because once a big ball of adepts gets formed you ll lose like 1 3 to half your lings just getting into melee range
You can theory craft all you want but adepts before the attack speed upgrade arent greatbvs lings 4 lings which is way cheaper than an adept can kill her before she kills 3 lings Moreover bile is a far more cost efficient way of dealing with slow moving adepts than banes Banes trsde horribly with adepts
You seem to be theory crafting as well 1 adept beats 4 speedlings when stutter stepped kited In larger numbers Yes adepts don t scale well before upgrades but that is assuming completely in the open engagements with no stutter micro or shade usage Adept attacks almost always involve kiting around wedging between mineral lines and shading between bases adept defenses are similar at the toss base
They only got 1 nerf vs Zerg Don t be stupid
Technically 2 Adept now 3 shot larvae instead of 2 shot Not a big deal but still a nerf p
You re missing a bit the point One nerf only affects PvT and zergs winning because of lurker and ravager are so strong and zergs have in general a strong lategame So the photon overcharge nerf doesn t effect that in any way And it s harder to balance PvZ because despite the numbers protoss is actually doing quite well Maybe a better mappool would already balance the numbers a bit more
That s true your right Hope we see a lurker and ravager nerf soon
deleted
Where did you see this 15 drop
I think there need s to be more maps with free naturals and a third with a chokepoint I m pretty sure the very zerg favored maps are the real issue with PvZ A decent chokepoint would make it easier for toss to defend against zerg all ins while toss does some aggressive harass with wp or air Drops and nydus I think could use some tweaks and maybe do something about ravager bile building damage everything else seems pretty fine though
making turtle maps as a band aid fix for a weak race is a bad idea then the game will be balanced around boring maps and you re stuck with them
Toss just dont whine as hard a terran Terran wont be happy until all matchs up are 99 999 TvX
Perfect example of why no one should other with anything said in r starcraft
It s going to get worse there hasn t been enough matches since the patch to drive the down Give it time it may reach the lowest matchup in the history of SC2 This is not a protoss QQing I just objectively believe this will happen given the fact that early game adept stuff was propping up the already low PvZ s before and now that it s mostly gone the will drop like a rock
the circle jerk is real
A number of Protoss builds could be slightly too greedy now for all we know More games need to be played b c if it s a difference of having 1 extra adept in the mineral line vs speedlings maybe you can delay an extra gateway and suck it up He s committing you commit something to not have to commit completely I have faith high level Protosses will show proper build placement adept usage and the more sparing POs can hold attacks fine with potentially slightly more conservative builds at the worst The question once the dust settles is Is it too much to the point zergs can auto outmacro when forcing certain reactions A number of you are feeling the immediate effects while also experiencing zergs trying to take advantage of that It doesn t surprise me at all that protosses who are so dependent on their BO s and compositions to be tripped up by their first nerf Let the dust settle first imo
Those stats are Pre patch means we needed those supidly greedy builds imo to just hold any ground Now this win percentage is just to go down even more
its offical we need a 10 shield buff on zealots
Protoss fucked up by winning a tournament I would love to see a graph showing the ratio of Protoss s winning tournaments and Protoss then getting nerfed Games rigged
Shouldnt be in a haste and find the exact error first not yet found a new playstyle after adept nerf maps favoring zerg specific units too weak Take the time and find the best solution for this problem also Im sure soon the winrate will increase a little bit again Shotime just 3 0 ed bly with archon immortal style
Those stats are Pre patch
oh rip then D
The game hasn t been played that long Protoss got changed massively Give it time and patience see if it will swing back Also work hard to identify specific situations in which Z won that they maybe should not have Without patience and evidence Blizz likely won t act
MY ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SAYS PROTOSS IS OP PLZ NERF pulls up statistical evidence that opposes opinion THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE IS FLAWED BECAUSE ANECDOTAL REASON
What s hilarious is how PvT plummeted with the launch of LotV contrary to what the b net whiners would have you and apparently DK believe
Its pretty easy Because of their higher winrate vs terrans prenerf their MMR got higher and so they had to face Zergs with higher MMR and so had a lower winrate After the latest nerf the protoss will face zergs on the same level and the winrate will get better When for example you know a cyclone timing which beats every protoss you will get masters with the kills vs protoss but will loose to probably every zerg since every protoss used adepts vs terrans to get easy wins they will have a harder time vs zerg
Those are tournament stats
It s because roach ravager all in and every variation of it is super difficult to hold at almost all levels I ve even seen zergs just 3 base and mass all muta and its completely viable even if you scout spire The reason protoss at the highest level can manage is pro players are able to get adept damage pressure in the early game and gain a very slight advantage For everyone else they just have to manage
This is just misinformation First if we are going to talk about all ins Protoss still have insanely strong all ins they aren t any worse than Zerg s As for 3 base Muta there is no fucking way he can keep massing Muta if you scout it You can hold just fine until Phoenix are out Early on you rarely see more than a small Muta flock because they are easy to counter their real strength lies in sudden tech switches
Name a protoss all in build that can work at the masters level that you can use on 2 bases before the zerg push comes maxed out at 200 200 I have seen a litany of builds from zerg 3 base that are incredibly difficult to hold at all levels Protoss is forced into the same opener every game versus zerg unless they like dying to those tech switches It s insanely easy for any zerg to craft any all in on 3 bases and push the protoss for a kill It takes tons of metagame knowledge and lots of scouting from protoss to hold that push and survive
7 gate Blink Stalker with Warp Prism Works great in close spawn Ruins of Seras and Orbital you can just jerk around the bases and as long as you keep the prism safe from Queens Bile you win Zerg can t stop this unless they scout it Chargelot Immortal all in works on most maps 3 base 200 200 Zerg pushes are not all ins they hit on 8 30 at the earliest Realistically that won t happen unless you leave the Zerg alone for the entirety of the game which is your fault You have easy harass with units like Adepts Prism Oracles and Phoenix This also doubles up as a scouting method This buys you enough time to create an army and do some sim city which is really really helpful vs Zerg
It s really not that hard for zerg to scout any of those builds and I have yet to see chargelot immortal do anything against roach heavy builds and again that s an easy switch into muta which would leave you completely open for an easy tech counter I could see the 7 gate work but that s considering the zerg isn t already doing aggression and you are able to micro well enough and keep your prism alive with ravagers and queens going off If the all in fails you lose the game straight up For zerg they can throw a powerful 3 base at you take a 4th and commit or not and still get good gains It s less about the build orders themselves and more that protoss is pigon holed into 2 star 2 robo builds just IN CASE they decide to throw a crazy aggro build at you I ve seen the damage that can be done with phoenix opener oracle and adepts and its really negligible on the zerg economy unless they are making big mistakes Good zergs or bad are going to use those builds and throw them fierce with good ravager micro or not Now with the pylon nerf that sim city isn t going to do much I ve held the all ins before its all possible for protoss to survive and make good choices but in the ladder meta its simply just stupid how simplistic the zergs builds can be and how overly complicated the protoss builds have to be to hold I don t even try to do anything different in PvZ or I just get steamrolled
You don t need to kill many Drones when harassing Zerg that would just be the cherry on top Forcing him to waste larva on units and keeping him on edge is good enough to severely delay or weaken the eventual push You underestimate the usefulness of chokes against roach or ling based armies imo I can t count the times where I was pushed back due to good building placement despite having a superior army
and what have you calculated for the correct winrate to be if the game were perfectly balanced
Sure but we aren t terrans bitching it up on r starcraft so good luck getting any attention or patches in your favor
I played protoss for 3 years being diamond for a couple season and now I lose to plat zergs on a regular basis caused me to switch to terran and play only unranked very disheartening
Protoss players got lazy during HotS They have to learn the game again now that it s not just EZPZ Force Fields MSC bullshit and Blinks anymore
Just adapt
You are absolutely right Protoss is no longer handed wins as easily and they just complain
Show this to the sheep in Twitch chat and they will still claim Protoss is an easy race that wins because the race exists
Protoss need to learn that they can no longer mass stalker A move Give it a few months for them to adapt to having to use strategy and the win rates will be up Wow downvote as soon as I said that stay salty Protoss D
Zergy is mad hes getting called a patch zerg again
protoss still used to stupidly greedy builds imo what a joke that it was viable for protoss to double expand and hold with some adepts and pylon cannons
Those stats are Pre patch means we needed those supidly greedy builds imo to just hold any ground
still got your brain stuck in hots
so that s the reason I m still in silver league not because I m bad but because Zerg is imba wow thanks inaccurate statistics
Byun is rank 1 player in the world by a huge margin http aligulac com players 47 ByuN Seriously you can t use aligulac without taking it with a large grain of salt
byun actually could be number one now in legacy
aligulac com uses an algorithm very similar to what the ATP adopted for tennis and other individual sport leagues use to rank professional athletes ofc it is not supposed to be accurate when telling who the actual best player is at a given time on the other hand inference they provide based on pure tournament matches win rates are indeed reliable and accurate considering how unpredictable a game such as Starcraft can be
except when people are using an out of date graph showing the balance its currently PvT 277 242 53 37 PvZ 386 438 46 84 TvZ 360 333 51 95 from Jan 20 Now
You re right that the algorithm is similar However the algorithm they use in the ATP has way way more qualitative stats to define the the skill of an individual player We only have winrates Moreover the analytics never never try to claim france is statistically better than britain in tennis with just winrates Yet you come to SCreddit and people always try to prove racial balance using far inferior stats than even tennis use for equating skill Winrates are sadly just a very quantitative stat that doesn t describe much
If No 1 Protoss player has no problem in PvZ that is OK These statistics is useless
flawless logic
Just because one player can dominate doesn t mean that it s balanced It s a testament to his skill not a testament to the balance of the game Look at BW Bisu is an amazing player but protoss is weaker there Just because he can dominate does not mean that it s balanced He could probably dominate even more if things were more even I m not saying that PvZ is imbalanced all I m saying is that if the stats are so anomalous maybe there s something to be looked at Claiming everything is fine is just burying your head in the sand without first investigating And just as taking this particular stat by itself and scream Zerg imba is moronic dismissing it because one or a select few players are doing ok is also moronic IMHO there is something to be looked at here To me it says that the race has design issues that should be fixed there are aspects that can be overly abused which lead to insane winrates but without that abusive aspects the race is simply dead which leads to insane lossrates
Just gonna quit playing ladder until something is done about this fuck it
Literally unwinnable Memes
You re not going to fix the problem unless you rework Protoss Protoss has always been vastly overpowered or stupidly weak never a mixture of the two The Elmer s glue esque tweaks and fixes Blizzard roles out have proven to be ineffective and stupid
GIVE onFire FLAIR OR RIOT
You know Acer Dead Pixels probably wasn t the best team name
ADP best team Just like DP Fantasy best player
Anal double penetration I ll show myself out
Adenosine diphosphate you fucking heathen
State and Neeb D two of my fav tosses nowadays this seems excited
Scarlett and Stateeeeee 3
That s almost the exact roster of ADP lol
Plus based god n33b
Don t forget state
it was just acer signed up before not ADP O
That s not what the OP says
Thats untrue Look up Liquipedia or sc2improve they were announced as partnered team from the beginning
Did acer disband
MMA in military Nerchio parted ways with Acer Scarlett was she still on the roster or considered semi inactive
I think shes been semi retired for the last year or two at least Can t say I ve seen her in a game in all that time
She played at home story cup and at dreamhack Leipzig Also she s been playing in the NA qualifiers for WCS IEM
Acer DigPix to be replaced by Acer DigPix Excellent
Finally some good news GIVE US THE FLARE
RIP other teams
Excellent stuff coming out of SC2Improve as always
All those Terrans PogChamp
god damn at first I thought Anders Semmler were sponsoring a SC2 team Room On Fire good luck guys
Whys state on the team
State is good He has a lot of potential
Please don t implode
Never forget dPix
So Acer dPix was replaced by Acer dPix NAToss This Changes Everything
Overcharges
Wait wait wait wait no team onFire YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG How is Bly NOT the captain of Team onFire
Poor patience
Disgusting lineup U
When you say disgusting does that mean you think it s cool Or it s bad
Disgustingly good obviously
The decadence of foreign sc2 in 2016
I eat like shit and even I think that looks gross wtf
This is the result of koreans stealing foreigner money in tournaments With new WCS lets hope morrow will be able to afford some mac cheese in the near future
I would not keep my hopes high after all he s not a REAL PROGRAMER P
This is disgusting
My thoughts exactly
LMAO Just a hint of butter
This kid is going places
WutFace
It ketchup really less expensive than regular tomato sauce
Ketchup instead of actual pasta sauce DansGame morDuck
gross bro
Honey Boo Boo also eats ketchup and butter on her spaghetti
How do you know this
Bc I watch terrible tv On mobile here s link https m youtube com watch v qvlmXKtoi1A
Lol crazy world Thanks for the link I guess
go to the market and get some fresh produce you need it man
ketchup on pasta gross
It s really common in Sweden
And Norway afaIk
Still gross
What s that toilet paper for Morrow Late night fap sessions PvT
I like food too much to eat like that lol Why not eat something better tastier more nutrients and healthier when you re trying to be great at something
I couldn t watch the whole thing The sound of ketchup on pasta made me want to barf
No 1 Champion
morTarga the fuck is that
For some reason I want a player named Tomato to join Team Liquid
A perfect example of when the whole is less than the sum of its parts
Holy fuck that s gross step your fucking food game up pleb
Because ketchup and tomatosouce is so different Almoste all Swedes eats pasta with ketchup
It still doesnt qualify as a meal Tomatosauce expesially home made is totally different in sense of texture and taste Are you on drugs
nutrition wise nope of course not but nether dose macaroni and cheese i just dont se what so discussing with ketchp instead of tomato sauce even tho tomato sauce is better
Amazing camwork
pukes
Holy f that s gross haha wtf
God what happened to the orange jewce
I just threw up in my mouth a little If a pro gamer is willing to practise as hard as they have to to be the best wouldn t they also put in effort elsewhere to fulfil their potential Eating healthy isn t expensive if you go the Soylent Joylent Queal route Probably tastes better thought still disgusting as well
Ketchup DansGame
Ketchup Really breh Butter

Here the original wc3 map for comparison weow http classic battle net war3 images ladder maps twistedmeadows jpg
What ever happened to the maps where you had water in the pathway exampel
Water isn t allowed anymore on the maps Some people have performance issues on them Really sad imho There should be away around that
reasons for it whenever a unit is near or water the unit makes wave animations a whole bunch of units causing animations is just asking for trouble water reflects having everything going on near the water multiplied can cause quite some performance issues
So the solution is for the water textures to not be loaded on low shaders for multiplayer starcraft Besides no one cares about what the aesthetic of the map is when you are in the middle of a game
That or not have the water generate on lower end specs edit It just dawned on me that this is what you may have meant initially where as I interpreted it as don t load wave animations for low shaders Either would work however Its like there s always simple solutions to these kinds of problems but Blizzard always uses the nope just don t use that feature solution
Subjective opinion not a fact
Clear use of hyperbole replace no one with most don t
Some kind of disable button
I miss the maps with a country or jungle look stuff like Tal darim Heavy Rain or Whirlwind Almost all of the recent maps are all about this dark gloomy volcano powerplant thingy
So true It makes me happy to see earth weather season landscape on a map What if we had a map inspired by Autumn that would also be cool
browse the TL maps section there are some autumn maps here and there and lots of other themes as well
I ve seen people use textures from HotS and Diablo and it makes for some good autumn maps
Jungle and winter maps are the best maps
I have seen in a recent post of Blizzard that maps with water can be problematic for pc with lower settings
Turtle Rock loved that map on WC3
Completely out of topic question here If this thing exists where having units standing on water couldn t this be used in Arcade to create Battleships games like it was in Warcraft III The BattleShips Crossfire BattleShips Psycho etc
i really miss wc3 i wish wow had never happened If they ever did a wc4 it would be all wowified and lame like what happened to the starcraft story
Please make this MAP INTO THE CONTEST Make in Starcraft Style that would be an EPIC MP map D
Ok this was obviously meant semi serious I m not good enough with the editor to create maps but i d really liked it if someone skilled would take TM as a basis and creates the map If you do that keep in mind that starcraft maps work differently though you cant leave it as open
then make it as large and change the middle layout the corners are important the rest is kinda freestyle just get inspired by it D
ill give it another shot later
I tried my hand at it perfectly recreating your picture http i imgur com rbYZWNg jpg I wasn t a fan of all the pathways all around and it felt really cramped awkward I dunno
i kinda like it only thing is middle should be a watchtower with bushes around a bit wider and the bases should lead into the middle as well i was just freestyling mid mindlessly honestly D
I dunno been mapmaking for a while and I feel like the map is big and clunky Most of the bases can t breathe
This looks amazing for a start Nice job I agree that the map feels choked what do you think about this http imgur com 4u7t46a Red areas Make this same level as the walkway under the main so those two ramps can walk up to the ledge of main reapers etc Blue areas Lower these to flat ground maybe small walls to separate the expo s but nothing to build walk on because it feels tight in center of map Green areas The gold bases feel squished in the corner the most and with no building room in the main I figure just expand the main back into the corner and lose the gold EDIT So maybe the pocket natural now becomes open to those two ramps while the rocks protect your 4th and opens the possibility of keeping the gold as 1 lower level than natural for what would now be the pocket 3rd IDK P
I miss maps with green terrain D would love to see something like that
Someone make Overgrowth again plz
Air bases need to die in a chemical fire
blizzard doesnt want standard maps from the community air base behind ur mainbase as gold in a safe location that u can blink into to defend even should be fine imo
That part was so sad to read This community can be so caustic often with little reason
This is nothing You should have seen the r planetside community when they got upset Course planetside has a million and 1 problems that starcraft doesn t
I ve got 99 problems but planet side ain t one
Shiiet shoulda seen r globaloffensive when they released a recent patch Everyone was up in arms about making an FPS game fundamentally more RNG
Well DayBreak did fire their lead designer and the game is in a better state than what it was in when he was there
Higgles Higgles resigned And there as been basically no progress I mean I walked away after the drama got to much in my community They also hired Wrel which is seriously questionable and honestly smacks of desperation
The drama made you leave and yet you are still in r starcraft Holy shit that must have been some next level drama O
That drama was personal
This is true of every game community Satisfied people just don t care enough to post positive comments
There are positive circlejerks in pretty much every gaming community Much more than negatives The negatives just stick out more
Well even then the positives are usually more along the lines of don t change anything its perfect as it is developers are geniouses and released a masterpiece and shouldn t work on it any more instead of hey X was a great addition I really like that do more in the future please My favorite part was Y Like seriously no one ever gives them credit for how amazingly awesome it is that creep goes up the sides of buildings now or that workers just goto work at the start of the game instead of just sitting there going gee I wounder what we are going to do this game Mine minerals nope sit here and wait for orders or how about taking the time to make the carrier into a legit unit for those who liked it instead of removing it from the game since it was unused because the fighters where dumb
It s quite stupid to say they delivered an incomplete product Blizz s games are some of the most polished ever and in terms of content and love put into it they are probably one of the if not the best developers in the world But that doesn t necessarily make criticisms regarding their development speed invalid You just can t deny that over the decade of development time Blizz has put a fraction of new features and content into the game compared to what other often smaller development teams do Actually Blizz is completely known for their long development times Their games come out almost bug free every time and polished to a mirror sheen as a result but that doesn t change the fact that they just sometimes take ages to do stuff and seeing as we have seen other developers do more with less time while keeping up the same quality it s not unreasonable to conclude that there are probably some things in their development process which they could objectively do better in order to be faster without sacrificing any of the end quality or torturing their developers or any nonsense like that I guess my point is that Blizz should understand where this criticism is coming from and apply it to better themselves instead of getting demotivated For Starcraft 2 the criticism probably comes from a place where many in the community are worried because they have the subjective feeling that the game s community is going to shrink away until major features are implemented soon but games like CS GO have shown that games can stay relatively small and then grow to insane levels long after their initial release Actually CS GO is a good example People keep asking and asking about skins and voice packs for example I can t imagine this is so important to people because they don t enjoy the game without them I d rather assume that the people who keep asking about this assume that it s going to trigger some huge growth in the games community just like it did with CS GO And they may very well be right if Blizz handles it correctly
well its like honestly it will probably be better if the changes come out around the same time as Nova in terms of exposure Nova comes out a lot of the less competitive playerbase comes back to give it a go and boom there is a bunch a shit out while Sc2 is back into the spotlight Just a thought but I think it will be interesting to see what happens since they will be coming out near each other
Yeah the timing could be gold there
A lot of it is probably that Blizzard is more corporate in their job culture and they allow their developers to have lives Most companies in the gaming industry monopolize their employees lives and require 65 hour work weeks
You mean less corporate
More good kind of corporate
I always wondered what it s like to be a dev for an online game Work your ass off 8 hours a day go home and read some kid on the internet telling you that you re bad at your job
Honestly probably longer than 8 hours
Pre launch Probably 10 12 hours I can see the hours decreasing post launch since it s no longer crunch time and the focus is on delivering a polished product rather than a polished product immediately
In general all the time 10 12 hours Game development is notorious for having an absolutely brutal work culture Plus the pay is usually absolute shit compared to where qualified engineers could otherwise work Plus the engineering work requires solving extremely difficult problems compared to your typical software development job Game devs take game dev jobs because they love developing games Any given engineer at Blizz could walk into Google for a 1 5 2x increase in salary and great work life balance but they don t Why Because they like developing games That s why it s so shitty to see this community most of whom haven t the slightest clue about what goes into making a game criticize these folks for trying to make a great game
Talking to some friends at Google they re not working any less than the folks at Blizzard It s just a part of the big tech culture That said there s a pretty clear divide in comments complaining about development time between people who have actually touched high reliability scalable code bases and people who think that shit is easy or fast
Google has sneaked in a culture of living at your office and I don t think anyone realizes it s their fault As they continue to add office perks the average observer thinks Oh I want that too But what people don t realize is that if you re eating free breakfast lunch dinner in your office going to the office gym showering and napping at the office and using the office laundry and dry cleaning services you re not really ever at home
Who cares where you eat or do your laundry or nap or shower or whatever Do it where you want Googlers are free to The issue isn t that you re spending 10 hours on a campus of your own volition Google it s that you re spending 10 hours grinding out code because it is a requirement of the job Blizzard Check out the Glassdoor reviews of both companies sometime
You are free to But your boss notices who stays at the office and who doesn t I know what I m talking about I work in the gaming industry and have been in and out of non gaming tech industry for years I know a lot of people who went through Google Apple etc I currently live in Silicon Valley
My hours at the hospital are about 10 14 6 days a week Would gladly accept a park beds laundry and food that s not terrible
i don t think you do know what you are talking about when it comes to the work culture at a big 4 software shop so we ll have to agree to disagree on that one
It s team dependent in a huge organization like Google but in general they do not expect 7 5 hours Lots of friends there too
Work your ass off to feed your family get flamed by entitled kids complaining about a video game Just awful
This negativity didn t fall out of the sky let s be real Blizzard fostered it for years it s gonna be a while before what they ve improved has some visible results in how people perceive SC2 and Blizzard s devotion to the game
Dayvie being the better man
I just hope it motivates them to do more good work
The only reason we even entertained the notion that only 2 guys are working on sc2 or something like that is because it s the only forgivable reason we could come up with that it takes 4 week to fix a tiny thing or 6 months to show visible MMR from now and a million other crappy things we ve endured and are still enduring
Ah so what you are saying is you don t know anything about coding or game development because that s the only forgivable reason for a comment like this
Well their communication has sucked for years Maybe at the time to communication position was vacant P They brought it on themselves for the most part You reap what you sow and for them to reap something more positive it s gonna take a lot of sowing
then why does the heroes of the storm team for example manage to get much more done much quicker despite it being the same engine
They really don t Grandmaster league was announced at Blizzcon for heroes of the storm and Dustin Browder said on twitter a few days ago that they were still months away from implementing it This caused a shitstorm on twitter and reddit This is just a case of the grass is always greener
well im still going to complain because if they spent more time trying to come up with creative units and unit design instead of trying to force creativity through bad maps then I wouldn t complain but DK seems to think that gold bases and rocks are what makes this game creative which is bullshit some of the best games in SC2 and BW history are on very balanced and straightforward maps
complaining and criticizing are ok The way you do it is what matters
I don t think I ve ever seen DKim come so close to straight up telling us to chill the fuck out Glad he said what he did at the end It s very needed tbh
DK has a strong heart and and even stronger back hand
and strongest is his wallet Actiblizzard must pay him a fortune for convincing everyone the community is the problem after saving tons of dev recources by recycling a discarded WoL beta unit
He never said the community is the problem All he said is that non constructive criticism is demotivating and counterproductive Which really isn t news
Blizzard I just want to say that I m enjoying this game a lot and I really appreciate the level of communication we are getting Thank you for a great game and I hope to see more content in the days to come
Make that 2 of us
Ima jump on this bandwagon too
We are legion But we don t make as much fuzz as the angry ones
Well we are busy actually playing or watching the game So we don t have as much time as all the shit posters
LOTV is awesome I m not saying that to be delusionally positive It s a very good multiplayer game Blizzard took big risks and thought the right way and should be rewarded for it There were always going to be haters of SC2 and LOTV and in periods they are going to sound like they represent the community as a whole They don t
Yeah LOTV brought me back to Starcraft I played a ton of WOL then HOTS came out and it was OK but my interest quickly waned I ve already played more multiplayer in LOTV than I did in HOTS
I feel like D Kim is my mom and he is disappointed in all of us for our unproductive criticism But really he makes a good point if people get too upset when talked about stuff hasn t happened yet then Blizzard just won t talk about their plans at all Also anyone saying Legacy was released as an unfinished game needs to play some non Blizzard games and see what that really means
I like how he finally called out all the idiots about the sc2 is a small team and They told us this feature was coming and it s been a month why don t we have it blizzardruinsthegame brokenpromises
That s because the overwatch beta was meant for creating hype not for actual beta testing rofl
Basically all Blizzard betas these days
Basically all modern public betas are balance testing with all the major bug testing sorted out in alpha
nah they asked a ton of detailed questions about my experience right before the beta ended and now I think they are off responding to it all and updating the game Most betas just ask you to vote on a few silly questions to help them figure out how to extract more money from you then roll the game out into the store the next week
Not really it s been offline so long for the very reason they are trying to balance the characters fix matchmaking and alter the maps
Yea it definitely was an unfinished product But the point of betas these days it to garner hype via limited access to a game It worked for them with hearthstone
Betas in multiplayer games tend to be more about balance than about bugfixing
Yeah we can t have it all transparency of future visions accompanied by close to immediate delivery of these future goals The community updates are GODLIKE I can t explain how much they mean it would be a shame to see Blizzard stop being transparent in their ideas just because they have stated some cool visions for the future then leading the community to lose all patience wanting everything to happen right away otherwise false accusations of all kinds are starting It s an extremely childish mindset that only hurts both parties I think the silent majority of people are really positive towards the approach Blizzard takes now with the awesome communication between us and the collective goal of making this game even greater
It would be a real shame if Blizzard reverted to its older self of less communication and less transparency The community really needs to be more mature and accept that Blizzard has their own vision for the game that might not match our own And that s OK
Dkim telling us this is how its gonna be Map diversity is something that blizzard wants to go forward with and we need to accept it and think of how to improve upon the maps and ideas that we have Love seeing Dkim sticking to his guns and responding back to the community
This is so sad how r starcraft changes it s opinion every fcking week There s a bandwagon of people that follow blindly the newest opinion out of anyone known in sc2 community Whenever some known community member says something negative a top post on r starcraft and top comments are how this person is right and FUCK BLIZZARD then someone else bounces the ball back and suddenly everyone protects Blizzard same thing with Thooorin we went from this guy knows shit about sc why is he even getting into it to say what u want about thorin but he is right and today we got again he doesn t know sc2 and his arguments are false or irrelevant this happens over and over again I don t know if on other subreddits it s the same and I don t care but I remember that this place used to not fcking shit on everything after 1 thing that we don t like and we didn t jump into the defence of anybody after he she spoke about the matter Can we please not fcking jump from one extreme to the other every damn 5 minutes
I honestly think most people fall in the middle and stay silent about things I think the problem is that whenever one of the extremes gets an opening to promote their narrative they pounce on it
This is right it s an unfortunate systemic consequence of large online communities
Yeah I m some bored of this shit that I don t answer all these circlejerk threads
nah its NEW I noticed the heroes reddit suddenly becoming much more toxic and displaying the behavior people are talking about here it started when a bunch of people started watching new like a hawk and downvoting anything that disagree with their hurt feelings No new ideas or opinions can make it out on either side the middle ground is completely suppressed only anything the hive find super popular can escape NEW usually by being an extreme view an extremely selfish viewpoint regular popular community shows or internet celebrity backing
Heroes subreddit is hilariously worse than starcraft It reminds me of r starcraft 4 years ago when I was 400 points here constantly getting downvoted whenever I criticized blizzard for LAN or whatever reason But I never got banned for sharing my unpopular opinion while I got banned from Heroes cuz after playing over 1000 games I couldn t accept anymore how pathetically amateur Blizzard are in a lot of cases Later when the hype around the game starts dying out the bandwagoners and morons leave and the circlejerk starts turning around It s the circle of sub lives
Yeah I think it got a huge influx of people from lol dota that shifted after a few streamers antics caught on There are still a large group of then in denile about heroes being a different game than LoL or DoTa Posts that praise the differences or ask the team to try new things get downvoted en mass and anything to make heroes more like LoL or copy and past things exactly from those game without tweaking them on improving on them is the only acceptable answer even if it could have other bad side effects of the game Stuff like LAN was a pretty major decision at a high level stuff like that wont get reverted without MAJOR support or desire from community Letting a few people bitch about it won t change anything and suppressing complaints about it will only ensure it never gets changed It takes blizzard time to get work done that I can accept The only thing amateur about blizzard I feel about that game is how much they hold themselves back trying to pander to their community a complaint a share across all their titles Blizzard puts out its best when they lock themselves away and ignore all the community feedback telling them how shitty the stuff they are working on is and just make it and make it great anyways Then they put it out and discover we love 90 of what they did even the stuff we thought we would hate but blizzard proves they mostly know better than us and we complain about that last 10 and they eventually fix 5 of that Then sit back and ponder while the community rips and shreds the game apart for that last 5 of imperfection an then they come out and make a sequel a decade later after we have cooled down that has got all that and more stuff we didn t even know we wanted and blizzard puts in all the things people claimed would ruin the game that some of us had been asking for but which the main herd of the community couldn t handle but the community figures out no wait we do actually love that but hey it could still use just a small bit more polish getting us all in a frenzy again because we are all are used to perfection from blizzard
It s always been like this man The circlejerk is forever switching
If you only jerk in one direction it s called a stroke
Stop looking for some kind of consistent opinion consensus in an online community made up of thousands of random individuals Differing and often contradictory opinions are going to upvoted by the people who support them
What you have to realize is that there s 176 000 people subscribed to this subreddit That s a lot of different opinions to be had It s not one collective mind that changes every week You have crybabies on this sub that will upvote anything negative and people like me who almost never downvote things unless they really add nothing to the conversation which can skew that ratio
I ve had the opinion that they don t know how to make competitive map pools for a long long time
I really like your points on alot of topics but honestly the only one map pool i can remember being objectively bad was at the end of HoTS And it was due to map winners of the map making contest Everyone was happy that mapmakers get the spotlight but than hated on maps Blizzard devs made much more well rounded and balanced stuff overall
I d rather have map makers do a pool than blizzard to be honest however At least we wouldn t have weird maps that promote supposably creative play which in practice promote for example on prion allins and cheese Good maps should keep at least the first 3 bases standard and move the interesting stuff into the mid late game thats where I think creative map design can shine in competitive play just look at great maps like King Sejong for examples of that
They did a few times most recently the TL map contest that also was met with a ton of hate
Yeah I think people misunderstand why the hate happened it happened because the maps were voted on and Blizzard chose some maps that did not win and the community liked the ones they voted for a lot
deleted
Why even have the vote then Why does the DevTeam think they know so much about what maps should be on ladder
Well if the Dream Pool and the TL map contest are any signs neither do the community
Dreampool was Blizzard s idea what
Yeah the dream pool was the biggest flop in the history of map pools and it was not Blizzard s fault Fuck all y all D
I guess I was a little hard on him Sorry David we do appreciate these posts a lot It comes from a good place I really think some tweaks some skin packs some new ladder changes and that anti hack could potentially do amazing things for sc just want it as soon as possible lol
They made their timelines clear from the very beginning when they announced it on Blizzcon I wish people would ve paid more attention to that
That s the biggest thing to me people are acting surprised Blizzard stuck to their timeline Why is it surprising we ve known the timeline for months it s nothing new
Do you have any source on that timeline I never remember hearing about any such thing
Which Blizzcon are we talking about

HEY BLIZZARD I just want to say that i absolutely love this game and everything you do with it Except maybe the maps not being as standard as i am used to but that can get learned And continue to do amazing Things with this and other games
Just gonna come out and say it Dayvie you re the man Thank you for having the maturity to see above the unproductive comments and continuing to lead the game in a great direction I want you to be my boss one day Soon if possible
Totally agree with keeping things constructive If we want the game to be better let s keep a calm focus and state specifics and evidence Emotional ranting isn t going to help anything I have always appreciated Blizzard s attention to detail and polish The one thing that has always separated Blizzard from many others is that they don t rush anything out When it gets released you are getting a piece of artwork that probably had countless iterations behind the scenes before it brought about even small changes That s no different with what I imagine is the designing and balancing process of SC2 multiplayer The reason I as I assume many others spend so much time with this game is that I trust Blizzard will eventually get it right They won t give up until they re satisfied and they haven t let me down in retrospect The open communication is something I can t thank this dev team for enough It s just something you rarely see in most games You might get an explanation of the finished patch but to get an insight in between patches doesn t just make me want to give better feedback it makes me want to play more to see what s worth another look I ve been going through the progression of maps during the history of SC2 and it s impressive to see how many various unique factors have already been presented There were a lot of standard maps but plenty that did have some interesting designs that never got their full time in the spotlight It d be nice to see some mapmakers go back and see what used to make maps so much fun to play on and bring some of those ideas back into this new age of maps When I look at maps like King Sejong Station Frost or Overgrowth they were all pretty standard but took ages to grow old They had many amazing games and usually felt fresh compared to other standard maps mostly due to the creative layouts The standard maps we see nowadays don t take long to feel a little lacking compared to the titans we ve had previously However I m impressed with the new original maps that present a specific feature to differentiate them They feel like they belong but I wouldn t mind keeping an eye on what isn t working and maybe make changes mid season if necessary Also don t be afraid to get even crazier in aspects that work Going forth I hope to see the ladder continue to consist of half solid fun standard maps with a unique design and half completely original maps like the ones we see now The balance between experimentation and refinement is what playing SC2 is all about and that should carry over into ladder maps as well As long as each map is balanced enough so that no matchup feels like it has to be vetoed we can find a healthy spectrum between standard and original maps that don t sacrifice solid timeless design
has blizzard ever admitted they were wrong the pros do not like the maps the streamers do not like maps What was unique about maps like whirlwind or frost There weren t anything that stuck out out of those two and they were great and fun to play on
uhhh 1 which maps and 2 which pros
from what I have seen prion central protocol and ulrena are widely considered to be bad maps I haven t heard anyone talk about close spawns on ruins of seras but i would love to hear an argument for how it is good
So because maps are not uniform they re considered bad I ve heard complaints about protocol but that s pretty much it And blizzard addressed protocol saying they re going to polish it up
not sure what you mean by not uniform but playing new maps every season is part of what makes the game fun and the current maps are just not very fun prion is one of the most widely complained about maps because zvz is a total shitshow on it and the gold bases are incredibly strong for zerg in other matchups there are maps that promote different gameplay that are fun and maps that promote different gameplay that are not so fun a map that tries to promote different gameplay by making the 3rd 4th both gold bases is a pretty lazy way of doing so edit I will admit I had fun on prion the first month or so it was out but its stale now
Okay so what are zerg s doing thathe is just insane on that map I ve been playing on it and I love it I m a macro player and it s really really easy to play macro games on it in zvz If that is what you re looking for I can tell you what I do and my thought process through it It all comes down to scouting for a second overlord Even if the opponent does a pool first speed build into a gold the defending hatch first player will be way ahead
I liked the maps Ulrena was heavily criticized early on but people made it work Central protocol have some weird cheese for zerg But I don t know a lot I vetoed since the beginning of the season Prion is cool because it zerg can both become huge or you can easily attack from 2 fronts I know it is zerg favored but not impossible as some people make it
People complain about the maps because Blizzard s internal team has shown an inability to create good maps Not just this year but across the entirety of Starcraft 2 The best maps have all come from community mapmakers yet every once in a while Blizzard forgets that they suck at that particular aspect of their job and decides that quirky is better than good The few moderate successes they have had were when they got out of their own way and put out basic macro maps Antiga Shipyard Entombed Valley Shakuras Plateau that followed general guidelines of map design rather than focusing on one gimmick I scoured through a list of all 1v1 ladder maps in SC2 s history and the best Blizzard maps I found were Antiga Shipyard Akilon Wastes Entombed Valley Shakuras Plateau Metalopolis and I guess Vaani Research Station Compare that to Frost Cloud Kingdom Daybreak Whirlwind Bel shir Vestige Overgrowth Ohana Korhal Compound Coda Foxtrot Labs Polar Night Habitation Station King Sejong Station Terraform Yeonsu Echo etc That s not to say that there aren t flops from the community either but the peaks have almost all been from non Blizzard maps edit On top of general map design there s also the fact that Blizzard puts out ugly looking maps Obviously having doodads all over the place doesn t work but some of the stuff Blizzard has put out looks like they got to the first draft and decided to ship it as is
Can t we just have one map like Overgrowth Having unique maps is fine but I want just one nice simple map where you are free to use whatever strategy you want This isn t a black white issue If people want a standard map what s the harm in allowing one Also I find it strange David Kim describes Orbital Shipyard as a very standard map It has a backdoor natural and a very close and easily defended third on a high ground When I think of Standard maps I think of ones like Cloud Kingdom Daybreak Overgrowth Bel Shir Vestige etc
I don t think any single map such as Coda was to blame for the perceived blandness of mid HotS gameplay I think it had more to do with late HotS having Echo Coda and Expedition Lost being played at the same time All of which fit into the very standard 2 player map layout Three seems like too many for sure but I still think zero is too few
I m not talking about the season 2 2015 but about season 3 when Terraform Moonlight Madness Dash and BridgeHead were added Basically all the series no matter the tournament had Coda or Cactus Valley in them and the same strategies were used that s what generates the issues David Kim is talking about that s what generates the stagnation he doesn t want I do agree with you that the lack of something resembling a standard layout is more or less necessary but keep in mind that by doing that you are also heavily influencing the metagame development What I and many other mapmakers have suggested is to basically force tournament organizers into using more community maps and shy away from using basically any ladder maps by creating a Pro map pool in the same way iCCup used to do that changes rapidly over time you can keep a very interesting ever changing meta but sadly the WCS season get in the way and this is without even mentioning the incredibly strong lobbying pro players do to avoid any kind of non ladder map to ever reaching tournaments
The 4 player maps are rather standard maps If you dont think we have standard maps in the map pool I have no hope for you lol
I ll do my best to continue moving forward without your hope I gave you 4 good examples of what I consider very standard maps Ruins of Seras is pretty standard for a big 4 player map but not truly standard overall like those other I listed Lerilak is definitely not standard since it s got a very open natural with two entrances and spawn orientation makes a huge difference with the rotational symmetry Central Protocol doesn t have any single thing horribly wrong with it but overall is probably the most hated map in the current pool Only Horizontal spawns have a decent third base location watchtowers see too much of the map no ramp into main etc Don t get me wrong none of these maps are extremely unique or anything But I still maintain that none of them are very standard except possibly Ruins of Seras but not everyone likes large 4 player maps
Alternate accounts are a serious problem on bnet forums as well Sometimes its just one guy raising a huge stink with his various accounts being as obnoxious as possible Truly regrettable
Prion is fine Lerilak change is great Orbital Shipyard also great Central Protocol Could be cool map if the back rocks into your main ramp had a tighter choke so you could defend it with less The tile set on Central is a little confusing around the middle of the map
Blizzard your games are AWESOME and LotV is the best game I ve ever had the pleasure of playing It pains me to read that your team might feel discouraged because of a few loud negative voices Thank you for an amazing rts GG
Hey blizz the reason many of us were salty about the no map change is because we have played three of these since the beginning of beta they are almost a year old one of the more popular suggestions is to replace some of these with the new GSL maps Rakshir and Skyshield
As a Starcraft 2 fan right from the beginning I really appreciate how Blizzard is communicating during LotV beta and now after release I was really looking Forward for a fast ladder revamp but to be honest I think waiting for a high quality implementation is worth it I really appreciate that Blizz is giving insights early into new ideas so the community can discuss I really feel sorry for DK and his Team getting so much flak they don t deserve it Thank you Blizz and Keep up the good work
i think the most important part about maps is to have more than 2 spawning locations so that not every game turns into proxy cancer since the opponent knows where you are without doing anything tal darim all day please
My exact comment on the community update of this week Feels good and bad to be right YEA So when Blizzard communicates about the changes and when it s happening You guys all cry like babies See why companies don t like to communicate about their internal work If you want more transparancy STOP crying when a new feature doesn t come out tomorow It won t changes a SINGLE thing Blizzard works hard for us and Sc2 Thank you
try looking at dustin browders tweeter hes openly trying to communicate every day for heroes watch what he has to deal with yeesh
What is the point of community feedback and two way communication if blizzard reads what we re saying and then does what they were going to do anyway
What s wrong with sticking to your guns for a few things that you know the community is wrong about
the fact that the community is not wrong and the map pool is horrible every pro gm says that
I m not debating about specific changes I m just answering your question
How could the community be wrong about what they want I ve always felt like Blizzard feel they know what we enjoy more than we do and given the drastic and frankly quite epic decline in almost every single one of their games shows that they really need to drop this attitude
Because they clearly want to balance the game regardless of the map pool and now is the perfect time to try to do it If they succeed it s going to be better in the long run If they fail there are always going to be standard maps The community does not know everything Remember the dreampool remember the TLMC maps that everyone lauded yet ultimately hated
Some ideas for map make the maps beautiful and aesthetically pleasing to look at i think that s almost more important in some ways You want to just see the loading screen and enjoy the map feel fun to run around on too
But you have to keep in mind that the maps have to be able to run efficiently on all PC s even the ones with the minimum specs This means having as fewer doodads as possible and avoiding things such as water It s kind of hard to accomplish both usually when a community map is picked Blizzard spends a while just clearing out as many doodads as possible
It would be cool if they added a feature in the map editor where you could have different layers of decoration that will only show up depending on the settings the player is playing on I don t think it would be terribly hard to implement and would make it so that you could still have the bustling gorgeous doodad heavy maps for spectating WCS or other major tourneys but it would work for low settings that many people normally play on for performance
Yep I think Nate said something similar recently about how Blizzard generally has to remove doodads to make the maps run more evenly
I was wondering recently if there was a way for Blizzard to tier out maps So like the same map pool but map makers would submit multiple versions of maps high end mid tier low end Blizzard has every player s computer specs based on the graphics settings they use in game so they can just let the people who have nice computers enjoy a beautiful map and then dumbify it for people with microwaves
from what I ve gathered during my time of mapping is that the complaints often aren t from low end PC s but mostly mid to high PC users that start crying the moment fps drops to 59 and aren t willing to lower settings but yeah making sure low end PC s can play too is also a concern
yeah take full advantage of the combined tile set or what was it
Pinion Terraces needs one gold no more to be interesting IMO To create exciting games I d like to see the raised mid map blue mineral bases become golds The two current mid golds in the map don t see much use outside of late game scenarios and could also maybe stay but all this would encourage is expanding to those spots instead of the current gold bases Might see some wacky tactics that way though Risk is a factor because they re easily sieged from the low ground Scouting this spot could decide games if the player expands here very early on Defense might be easier from the ramp side for protoss to also create a safer gold expansion rush should they choose to do so The biggest downside here in changing this map to just blue minerals map wide is it loses all its excitement and kinda becomes drab With this suggested change I think we could see a pretty strong spiritual successor to maps like Habitation Station which created some pretty interesting games in my opinion and all races benefited marginally the same But maybe I m just crazy
Blizzard will never admit that they were wrong rofl It s not the first time they tried to spin it and pin the whole thing on ungrateful and demotivating community
exactly Also its not like LOTV is a new game Its the same game as Blizz released Wings 6 years ago Just has 6 new units like seriously wtf do these people do all day besides feel sorry for themselves
Well besides units they DID fix quite a bit of stuff in LoTV though it took them 6 years which is just bad no matter how you slice it So i kind of agree i guess
Anyone else don t think the map is as bad as people say they are except for Ulrena because fuck that shit
Much of the negative reaction arises from how some critical information in the post was handled Dropping the line we hope to launch the revamped ladder in the second half of the year right in the midst of an otherwise run of the mill community update was extremely ill advised and gave the strong impression that the expectations and priorities of the team are misaligned with those of the community How you guys thought that it wouldn t elicit disappointment and frustration I don t understand A separate post or YT vid similar to what Ben Brode s been doing for Hearthstone that explains the challenges the objectives and the timeframe would not have attracted the same kind of vitriol Not being mean but the controversy is 100 on you guys and the passive aggressive tone in this follow up does nothing for anybody The decision not to update the map pool is still highly questionable even after the detail we ve been offered here Freshening up the ladder every few months should be a basic function of SC2 s management and the developer oriented rationale that balance is easier when the pool is static is frankly not acceptable The customers come first that doesn t mean that you ought to take a scalpel to Prion Terraces based on mob opinion but you can t justify inaction or a controversial decision based on what the developers are comfortable with you have to base that decision on the consumer experience and in this case refusing to cycle in new maps has absolutely no upside for us
Agreed entirely new maps would keep the ladder refreshing Were on the first season of 2016 not years down the line in lotv and yet were forced to play the same somewhat uninteresting maps We dont need radically differentmaps either
This just shows that the community needs to be more positive Standard psychology here Positivity encourages people to work harder Negativity results in lackluster results and poor quality products
I love this new community update you guys are awesome thanks for your criticism I can t understand why you need several months to finally address the leave league bug or need another 6 months to revamp the ladder it makes it look like there are only a few people working on SC2 Wow asshole fuck off we need constructive criticism your negativity is demotivating
In practice removing the gold bases is bad What practice Where have pros played on this map with normal expansions Honestly you could just make one of the golds a normal expansion It s the double gold that s retarded vs zerg The map doesn t have unique strategies you either cheese as terran or protoss vs zerg or you lose
He s saying that their current principle is to have a diverse map pool The only real distinctive factor for that map is really the gold bases removing that makes it a standard map In practice removing the gold bases is bad because they re leaving their principle re map pool
Remove 1 gold and its the only map in the pool with a gold third Still unique and much better to play on
As far as winrate goes I like the map for obvious reasons but If that s all it has going for it then quite frankly it s not that much of a loss
I m actually in favor of the idea of unique different maps that push towards unique strategies The crux is all in what differences we re really going for Mineral heavy armies don t really appeal to me especially when you factor in that the map inherently favors zerg which means zergling heavy compositions Really close rush distances don t really appeal to me ulrena I think that is why they are seeing negative feedback about keeping this map pool That is my problem with the map pool It isn t that the maps are different it is that they are different in a way that isn t fun or appealing Maybe ask the community for ideas on how maps should be different I don t mean specific elements but maybe maps that favor air play Or maps that a really easy third is available for all three races I m not saying it has to be these things specifically I m just giving examples but let s find some unique ideas the community might enjoy
Don t flatter yourselves guys I doubt he s talking about this subs comments because they re toothless compared to ones made by people on the bnet forums Holy shit I went there to get away from the toxicity often present in this sub and that place is way way worse Out of the frying pan into the fire for real
I like map diversity I don t want the same builds on each map If you are rude in your comments you don t deserve to get listened too even if you have a good idea
I take issue with DKim blaming us for his team being demotivated We re the customers who ve purchased this product it is us who this game is for The playerbase is a fraction of what it used to be its because people have become demotivated to buy play this game Is that our fault The onus is on DKim his team to put out a good product that we consumers will buy support The aspersions from the community are directly related to the millions of posts conversations we ve had while seeing little change as a result What does DKim expect That we re all just gonna tell them hey guys good job If his team is that demotivated then perhaps they need to fire the person leading their team put someone in who will motivate them to do their jobs We all understand that it takes time to get things right but at his timeframe at 4 6 9 months from launch how many players will even be left They say time is money well i say DKim the clock is ticking but thanks for the update
It s the way people say things They appreciate the constructive feedback but people have been pretty extreme with how they word things Like your post You don t know anything about how they operate or what they are working on and you re saying somebody should be replaced That s not constructive and quite stupid imo
Its people like you that need to just fuck off
I don t
I like the maps
See how much of fucking pricks you are You guys are disrespectful and mean Who are you to talk shit about people like this The dev team and all of the Starcraft 2 have done so much and yet people only whine and make this community worse I just want to say FUCK YOU because that s how I m feeling You guys are toxic and make people feel bad Good job for demotivating people who are very passionate
ok sorry davie i take it all back your team is huge your team is fully devoted to this game and lotv is fully featured and complete but it still takes 7 months from release for ladder rework
sorry we were dicks after the last community update Thanks for everything you do for starcraft And keep up the community updates they re amazing We love you david kim starcraftteam 3
I wish blizzard would stop thinking every map must be unique I get that you want to have some different maps but not every map Imo people should be able to veto all the special maps So 3 maximum and the rest should be standard so that people can choose whether they like to play them or not And please blizzard stop being stubborn and admit that prion with double gold as your natural third has failed and just chance them to blue bases Not every idea has to be a succes
I think this is because they don t want to balance the game through standard maps and want game balance to stand on its own throughout a variety of maps They have said so before iirc They ve been pushing for a variety of maps since HotS where the community also shut them down and asked for standard maps all the time Blizz must see LotV s new meta as an opportunity to test if they can balance the game without overrelying on maps
It s honestly how Brood War was at first Blizzard didn t do shit to balance that game so you had some whacky fucking maps made in an effort to to balance out win rates between races
I agree with what he said at the very end The way the community is acting is demotivating for the SC2 team and Blizzard in general I agree that some things are taking a little bit too much time Skins for example but people don t seem to see how much Blizzard is investing and supporting SC2 I mean look at this year s prize pool you think a DreamHack or ESL will increase the Prize pool that much Afreeca maybe i m sure that all that support from the money to the way they worked on WCS 2016 and the way they are working with us The community for a better game shows how much Blizzard cares about the game So PLEASE stop being demotivating and discouraging and instead give constructive feedback even if you don t agree with SC2 Team don t just bach on the team and give them solutions and suggestions instead
So what if it is demotivating you abide by customers
tldr everyone shut the fuck up Thank god he said it People are insane on this subreddit recently
Good job guys we triggered Blizzard
Blizzard something I think that isn t brought up enough is the fact that you CANNOT hit liberators with spores OR queens on Orbital Shipyard if they position themselves correctly Please please PLEASE fix this by either removing unnecessary airspace or extending the amount of buildable ground behind the mineral lines on that map
Yeah you can You just can t do it if they get the liberators range Which nathanias popuralized doing after stealing the build from bunny
Yes and it s completely retarded here let me stop you from mining from 2 bases without effort GG
How is this bad I can put a Tempest there too and not get hit Zero effort There is a tech investment in doing that
Yeah its pretty strong I think the only real way to beat it is getting mutas out pretty fast but not commiting to it
On one base it does come out by 6 minutes On 2 bases its more like 7 to 7 30 So 1 they re gambling and hoping the opponent will not walk up and straight up kill them And 2 if the libs do no damage because getting a spire out in time is pretty easy the zerg is super far ahead
The talk about working together is pretty cool though in the old days you bought a game and that was it I hope they could tweak the cyclone and there was a lot of good feedback there to work with
I mean Blizzard gave you what you wanted right Now we have welfare championships so that you can cheer on your little favorite guy with the same skin color as you and feel happy about it fuck the top tier let them stay on their island and play amongst themselves After all we don t want top quality games we just want to cheer for someone who makes us think hey that could be me So why are you guys bitching at the team now
map pool is really stale central protocol really just let us use the GSL maps and no one would care that the ladder update is late or whether skins are in the game
Fuck david kim and his sack of bullshit
I like the maps I like that they keep strong units and interesting maps rather than flattening out the game and giving into whiners
The community had NO say in the development of SC and BW they helped the competitive scene stay alive and thrive but you want development power and say look at BW when the community had even less say then Also don t say give us tools over and over and then not say what tools you want
No anger at all just sadness by ignorance Blizzard does most of those things which is sad the community ignores them or hates them in the case of the last TL map contest which had some great cash prizes
I m not at all ignoring the map making community I mean honestly my entire point is that we need to work even harder for map making It should be monthly not seasonally And we should be collecting way more maps from the community and including them in the map pool
I don t know why he tried to deny the fact that SC2 multiplayer development team is small If it s not small it s absurdly incompetent The new ladder for example first they said it was coming with LotV then in early 2016 now it s second half of the year I doubt there are more than 10 people going to work every day to try and make SC2 a better game Not buying this have pity on us we are doing our best talk
Can you provide a link where they said it s coming with LotV
One of the best SC2 players of all time really hope it doesn t end like this
NotLikeThis
Thanks poppy
I ve always hated that scene
it s cool he just blazed some weed man
Well depending on how this turns out it may end any discussion about him being the GOAT
If this is true it s a fucking enormous blow to Life s reputation and the game itself Titles and even prize money might be forfeit but if you ve seen his earlier play he s still the greatest Zerg to play WoL and HotS Savior s name is now mud but he s still a bonjwa
Yeah GOATs sometimes get covered in shit but they re still GOATs
The thing is Saviour is most known for his match fixing even more than his period of dominance This could destroy his legacy
Darn you re sharp
sure but it just doesn t have the same ring to it anymore you re the champ but and there s the huge BUT It s the difference between fans madly running up to you for an autograph and a fan or two recognizing you slapping on the back and saying you know i still believe in you
If the best player to have played the game gets caught for match giving I might give up on starcraft
mvp never matchfixed tho
Life was the only player who wasn t Mvp to get me as excited as he would I really really hope it doesn t end like this
MVP was the boss Even more boss than the boss toss
Had an appropriate name too
Another top tier Zerg player getting caught with math fixing It s Savior all over again
I am slightly ignorant but Savior was before Jaedong became the best zerg right So Savior was just like Life more or less the greatest zerg
Yeah Savior became the best by creating a new way to play zvt Jaedong became the best by refining the savior style to the extreme He also innovated a bit 2 hatch muta but nowhere near as profoundly savior
Already happened once starcraft will survive somehow
It will survive in an even more crippled form Kespa never really recovered from the match fixing scandal and never attained such heights ever again If this is true it will definitely accelerate the decline of the scene It s not like current young korean gamers are flocking to starcraft and applying to play on Kespa teams It s all about the MOBA s in korea right now
Apollo has been right all along all Koreans need to be banned now from western events
Build a wall and make Korea pay for it
Dark Templar Trump
If life s wins are nulled does that imply that Mvp would be the only 5 times GSL champion in existence Wouldn t that also imply that MMA won Blizzcon
Usually erasing someone s win doesn t mean that the runner up wins There s just no winner
MBC OGN went as far as to erase the existence of the MSL OSLs savior won as if they never happened at all
Well I don t think there d be any reason to null Life s wins If he s accused of match fixing it means he threw games on purpose he didn t cheat in order to win
I think the idea is to discourage match fixing Good players will be less inclined to do it if their legacy is at risk Seems like punitive legal action would be enough but idk
To those who skipped reading the comment sections in TL According to EJ when it said neither KT or Afreeca were aware of this it meant that neither teams are aware of any incident that lead to the arrest
Is it possible this is entirely unrelated to SC2 Dude just got caught stealing or a DUI or something
We don t know what he was accused of so yes it is possible
From TL The point is the location of prosecutor s office Changwon office All korean e sports matches are played in Seoul because influence of Seoul as capital is absolute like Paris But Life is interrogated in Changwon not Seoul Changwon is quite far from Seoul It is far more than 400km 250 miles But Changwon is quitecclose from Life s hometown But most interesting thing is Changwon prosecutor s office is specialized in investigating Match Fixing Most Sports soccer baseball basketball volleyball starcraft Match fixing investigation have done in Changwon That s why korean fans are suspecting Life s Match fixing
This makes me sad Although without a conviction I m not jumping to conclusions
on the bright side we got called a sport like basketball baseball volleyball soccer
yeah by a guy on a starcraft message board
Sure I understand that I get that what this is most likely about But still until we know officially what is going on we can t know for sure
Please just be a drunken monkey incident like Stephano
On the other hand hearing about Life going down Fruitdealer s path with drinking would be similarly sad
Fruiddealer has had a drinking problem
At least had At the time when his fame slowly shrinked
it s only a drinking problem if you have no money
Tell that to my liver
That s silly of course your liver doesn t have money
But then everyone looked at the picture with Stephano sporting the Raybans being escorted away and looked upon him as a rockstar
Rockstar Stephano was awesome 1 zerg imo
Let s hope
He s getting prosecuted for raping a frenchman last year
Really Source I d read more about this Edit OH I GET IT I GET IT I GET IT NOW
Not his first offense He was caught on camera in 2012 https www youtube com watch v tNSfQ1wPZbU
But Stephano won that game
Shhhh it s the best I could do on short notice We ll call that attempted rape okay
It happend at blizzcon the poor frenchy was the last foreign hope LILBOW

I love that it starts with May contain content inappropriate for children
Ayy
I feel the need to point out if there was any sort of certainty that he was arrested on matchfixing issues KesPA would have cancelled his game not pushed it back So no one really knows enough to say anything at this point
Which means he would have been brought in because of information that was given up in the ongoing prime investigation
Hmm this is pure speculation but I can imagine that KT somehow got an info about this incident and tried to not have their company name connected to this I can also imagine that those huge companies have some kind of influence on local authorities to delay the investigation process However the whole story is sad and I hope this accusation turns out to be false
YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE
BRING BALANCE TO STARCRAFT NOT LEAVE IT IN DARKNESS
From my point of view the non matchfixers are evil
WELL THAN YOU ARE LOST
I HATE YOU
YOU WERE LIKE A FOREIGNER TO ME I LOVED YOU
I HAVE FAILED U LIFE I HAVE FAILED U
I HATE SAND
IT GETS EVERYWHERE
just like life s lings
Too soon

Life paid Lilbow to throw his Blizzcon match Kappa
made my day
what should I say on the interview Lilbow Tell them youre practicing for lotv Life
That would be the best worst news for the entire scene
To be honest I think that Lilbow would actually get less shit for that lol
But the fact that he accepted the matchfix would be even more controversial and could end his career
He threw the game either way At least he would have made some money from it
Considering his chances against Life I wouldnt really fault him for that
Life tried to throw hard but Lolbow was worse than expected
Do Koreans bet on transferes
Pretty good question Especially considering he requested a trade
Out of all the things to bet on that would probably be the worst Way too easy to get inside information prior to something being announced Even for real sports in Europe where you can bet on anything I think that s pretty rare
well considering that kespa put away game timers to prevent some sort of bets I wouldn t be surprised if that would be a thing
Don t worry guys Life will find a way
Life ALWAYS finds a way
Does anyone have vision over there We could pop a Nydus in his room to get him out I really hope he didn t do anything wrong
Not enough vespene gas WE NEED MORE VESPENE GAS
I hope Life is just drunk too much to celebrate his trade and destroy some glass or something
It s Korea you don t get arrested for public intoxication If you did half the country would be locked up
I doubt Life actually threw any games but that s not the only thing he could be in trouble for Here s my guess on what Life may have done emphasis on guess and on may have Remember when SPL started hiding the game timer in their broadcasts The stated reason was because betting sites were commonly taking bets on specific things such as Will player X make a third nexus before Y minute mark It s possible that Life took money to do or not do specific strategies So even if Life never threw a game it s possible that he took money while thinking Well I was planning to make 16 zerglings before the 6min mark anyway He may have been called for interrogation about circumstantial evidence regarding bets placed on his match
That doesn t even seem evil
It s not as bad as match fixing but people are still losing money
Relax guys it s probably nothing Remember innocent until proven guilty
It s probably something But it is definitely innocent before proven guilty
The ominous arrest dont help it at all definitely something
The tweet said that Korean for arrest and in custody for investigation is the same word
Yea but it comes off as ZerGJunO being rather hopeful is arrest
Yea but official kespa statement isnt too positive eith its wording and bit defensive no Maybe its how they word all these things but im bit worried
All Kespa are doing is making sure someone under investigation for match fixing isn t playing Doesn t seem negative at all That said with the way the tweet puts it is this actually arrested or more like a call in for questioning Lastly innocent until proven guilty
General attitude in korean forum and reaction there seems to be in full panic mode similar to reaction here Hopefully its just nothing but oh man
Just hope the prosecutor they are talking about is not Miles Edgeworth
HOLD IT
sigh Wright I really hope this is better than your usual tricks
Ehm well you see haha

Skimming r all must be some onion article wait what
Just in case you need more context Life is a professional Starcraft 2 player one of the best of all time There has been suspicion of matchfixing illegal betting activity within the scene for some time Late last year the owner of a team as well as a few of his players were arrested in a matchfixing sting The players and coach were mostly fringe players and there had been some evidence which had been hotly debated as to whether it was evidence at all that those players had been matchfixing for some time so although it was a blow to the scene people mostly had been ready expecting something to happen In addition I think people hoped that that was the end of matchfixing in Starcraft 2 and that the SC2 scene could move on This arrest of one of the best players of all time who is very popular came out of nowhere so it s a huge shock Like if this player is matchfixing it feels like anyone could be I think there s also a lot of angst because the Starcraft 2 professional scene has shrunk in the past few years A scandal like this definitely wouldn t help the scene ETA I should add I believe a big part of the reason they re being arrested is that matchfixing in South Korea where this is taking place is conducted by illegal gambling rings so the arrests occur more because of that than say one person betting on himself to lose a game or anything This part of my knowledge of this whole thing is the most murky so someone else might be able to explain better
If Parting is making a 100k salary Life must be making the same or probably more
One of the best Starcraft players Terrible day
Don t talk about it as if he s already been confirmed to be match fixing time will tell Though this is a bad omen so to speak
Life is the 2nd most successful starcraft 2 player of all time
Arguably first He seems to be less meta dependent than Mvp ever was and has been successful over a longer period of time at this point He s also won more money I believe and probs had more influence on the meta
well if you go by prize money life is second to MC by a very thin margin
Not if you include the bonuses he gets from the match fixers
Don t rush to condemn him just yet but I am also surprised as shit by this news
Maybe he just killed a person is all
The trade between Afreeca and kt was done by Life s own request and they confirmed that neither of KT and Afeeca were aware of this WTF I really don t understand anything
Clunky translation just means they were unaware of the circumstances surrounding Life when they trade went through Trade was arranged by the teams at Life s request Basically trying to make it clear the trade has nothing to do with the arrest present situation
Think it meant more as neither team didn t know about arrest situation when they traded and that life requested transfer himself
Your point makes sense Google trad In addition to Lee Seung Hyun is the trade association has been made to your requests KT master roll African Prix team and the team is not hayeoteum not aware of this issue and confirmed the previous trading teams through the Secretariat We prefer not to generate a third of the damage such as through improper speculation and disseminate unverified facts relating to this trade
Eg clarified in the tl thread now that I read it and my korean is bit fuzzy right now Have to sleep Will see how this developes tomorrow but life IS confirmed arrested for some reason Its not questioning or anything He is arrested Doesnt look good at all
From TL The point is the location of prosecutor s office Changwon office All korean e sports matches are played in Seoul because influence of Seoul as capital is absolute like Paris But Life is interrogated in Changwon not Seoul Changwon is quite far from Seoul It is far more than 400km 250 miles But Changwon is quitecclose from Life s hometown But most interesting thing is Changwon prosecutor s office is specialized in investigating Match Fixing Most Sports soccer baseball basketball volleyball starcraft Match fixing investigation have done in Changwon That s why korean fans are suspecting Life s Match fixing
that awkward moment when life takes the son of savior nickname too seriously
Rip boys Why would life need to matchfix though He shouldn t be desperate for any cash o O I m going to give life the benefit of the doubt on this case
Or he was aware of matchfixing in which somebody threw against him
But he is arrested not brought in for questioning
Apparently the same word in Korean so I ve heard
Ive only really heard it in context with actual arrest though
No this is wrong information The article in Korean clearly states it was an arrest
so there s a possibility of life in prison
You clever bastard
I hope he is innocent because if he isn t Jesus That s a big hit to SC2 s credibility to have one of it s most illustrious members engaged in match fixing
Have we officially found our sAviOr
Save this official for now
too soon
I didn t think things could get worse for SC2 in Korea I was wrong
Starcraft is turning out to be similar to russian history and then it got worse
Can t win a land war on Aiur in winter
And CSGO fans complaining about their match fixers not getting unbanned
nooooooooooo
Don t forget guys life always finds the way
Wasn t he one of the people that YoDa threw matches against Maybe this doesn t really have much to do with him
He won vs YoDa 2 0 in code s last year He also won in Proleague vs BBoongBBoong
But I don t think Life winning vs Yoda would been an upset So I doubt people would have bet against him
Life is just a kid isn t he Teenager
he is 19 years old 20 in korea
I enjoy betting Starcraft pretty much every match available Life has had some very suspicious matches based on odds movements I created a thread 6 months ago with my suspicion Obviously this proves nothing but it has happened on more than one occasion for Life https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3cspvv life match fixing
did you remove the thread or mods did
yaa wtf
wow good call
let s hope he did something like being too drunk and disturb people in the public or anything of that sort We can t withstand another blow to the scene
It s Korea you don t get arrested for public intoxication If you did half the country would be locked up
Allright allmighty reddit anyone remembers any shady game from Life Winning or Losing Most likely SPL or SSL
Life always had a reputation for doing much worse in Proleague than individual tournaments I can t think of any MKP like behaviour though

Please be like a drug bust or thievery Don t be because of match fixing Esports doesn t need this
can somebody please find Ja Rule so I can make sense of all this
This would be fucking insane Please no Life please no So far as the post says it s not conclusive at all so I really hope he hasn t participated in any match fixing After Mvp it took me awhile to find a favorite player and until now Life was that player He was the only reason I got the KTRolster flair and if he is found innocent will be the only reason I get an Afreeca Freecs flair So shit I guess just hope he hasn t done anything wrong for now and wait and see
I keep hiding this subreddit and it keeps showing up anyway I might just kill myself
I feel you bro
Holy shit This would be an absolutely devastating loss to the scene if this ends up going the way of Yoda and Prime I just don t understand why Life would ever match fix not saying he did but just speculating It s not like he is hurting for money Surely his career can t end like this
Came here from r all can someone give me some context
one of the best and most successful Starcraft 2 players in history has been arrested in Korea Apparently he could be under a match fixing accusation but that is absolutely not for certain just a rumour Starcraft history has been shaken by a huge match fixing scandal in the past so SC fans are very worried this could occur again It is probably unlikely that we ll have more detalied information soon because it is very late in Korea as far as I now so speculation is getting pretty out of hand
to go in deeper than u ilsegugio The scandal that 1st hit the SC scene was in 2010 iirc it was a VERY organized match fixing rink There was this player saviOr Ma Jae Yoon that served as a middle man in between the match fixing brokers and other players something like this but change head coach for a player
Rumors fly in he got caught sleeping with a minor and had illegal substance of some kind
https twitter com ZerGJunO status 693060949436071936 ref src twsrc 5Etfw This seems reassuring that it is probably just a misunderstanding
what do you think arrest means in english
I don t know much about it and what the difference is but I assume that most people look at arrest as more caught in the actual act of doing something illegal whereas put in custody for questioning there is a chance there could be a misunderstanding
Yes arrest means there was an arrest order which is issued when substantial evidence is found where as when youre put into custody its for questioning and its not an official arrest
No he is wrong There is a clear difference between the word arrest and investigation and the Korean article uses the word arrest You would NOT use for mere investigation Yes his guilt is not proven but he is not there as a witness or something loke that
Life was paid off by the Korean mob to throw games by cheesing Unfortunately he was so good he still won
Jesus I haven t paid any real attention to Starcraft 2 for a long time now but I remember back when I was madly into the eSports scene seeing this new kid come out of nowhere and start destroying people I remember passionate discussions arguments and competitions with friends over this kid and his opponents This really isn t cool though I hope he didn t do it and is found innocent but if he did then I cannot feel sorry for him There is a big scandal going on in Counterstrike at the moment a team of players Ibuypower who were caught match fixing and subsequently dropped as a team and banned from all tournaments that Valve had any say in For some reason a lot of people want them to be unbanned but I really cannot see the logic in that I don t care how good a player they are I don t care if they have a sob story behind them Match fixing when money is on the line and it is definitely on the line in eSports is unforgivable I mean just look at what is happening here this person has been taken into custody pending investigation and may face criminal charges for this the ones who were banned by Valve got off easy
I am so damn frightened
So will he be allowed to play his match against Bunny in GSL Code A
Lmao I have a bet riding on that match Threw 20 down online for Life
Prosecutor Come on even without practice there s no way Lilbow fell for three fucking 6 pools in a row s
I just want to cry not you Life
it all makes sense now Lilbow was paid off to lose to Life in blizzcon
I don t believe a word of it Lilbow wouldn t do that to his fans
Savior all over again BibleThump
Let s all remember what happened to MKP Let s not have that happen again Give the kid space and wait til everything gets figured out
Like I get this blog applies to the recent drama about WCS and personalities throwing shit at each other But Life s case I don t think people are being over negative there I didn t see anyone jumping into conclusions all I see is people wishing please let not be matchfixing I don t think any of those comments are damaging Life s rep or the scene Do those comments count as being negative Does especulation count as being negative TLDR I understand we must be positive but how this applies to the news regarding Life Am I missing threads posts where people already assume he matchfixed and or our scene is ruined
Maybe he posted in a more preventative manner There s no doubt things COULD go downhill fast with regards to the situation and it seems like a decent enough time to make the post
I missed this comment before but yes exactly what you said thanks I thought I was clearly transmitting that sentiment but I suppose not
bassically hes throwing crap in his cut the crap blog post lawl
Hey I think you re mostly right but as much as Life being innocent is a strong possible outcome the opposite is as well I mentioned precedent in the write up because I think that if Life ends up being guilty that could unleash a shitstorm and I d like us to be more ready for it
Every time I take a shit I get anxious about the strong possibility of clogging the toilet so pretty much every time I take an empty roll or even push it out of the TP fold it so that it is sharp enough to cut the shit into sections Usually I can get two slices in before the structural integrity of the roll gives out and I finally have go for the flush
what in the fucking what
Let s cut the crap
Also literally shitposting
quit playin with scissors and shit and cut the crap I don t have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know its a rap
http gfycat com SafeSevereAustralianfreshwatercrocodile
If you consistently worry that much about it why not buy one of those blades you can use to cut up jams and have that whole load be lifted from your shoulders and mind
Where would i put it And I m not going to wash a blade every time I take a shit
I assume it d come with a holder And you wipe your bum so wipe your blade
I wasn t expected that to be the top comment

wow
cool
I think you should lay off the jam
I love you Catz Keep the faith This is our game not kespas spotv afreeka or even blizzards THIS GAME BELONGS TO THOSE THAT PLAY FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME not for any other reason All the recent drama in the scene hasn t affected my games one bit I love this game till I die
Positivity on the front page or r starcraft Am I in a parallel universe or something Thanks CatZ
Well what do you think about the rest of the article of which life was just a small part of
Thanks for clarifying I think you get the idea of what I was saying regardless if you want to suggest a better word for next time i ll honestly keep it in mind
I ve always been partial to crucified in the court of public opinion
vilified crucified daemonized
you think those are all better fits perhaps vilified crucified and daemonized sound a bit harsher than what I was meaning to imply
Well I just gave three because I didn t know what you meant to imply What I thought you meant to imply was that he was slandered as in legally so
I guess I ment to say his reputation was tarnished
Hey Catz made a video in response to your article https www youtube com watch v kLvpycNFVgo feature youtu be I strongly disagree that we shouldn t be negative about this situation
I watched it s cool man I m not saying you shouldn t be sad not talk about it or get over it over night those are all valid feelings and it s awesome that you re as passionate as you are for this game I am too Maybe not quite AS passionate as you seem but I certainly love StarCraft just like you do I owe my Lifestyle to this game I ve met most of my best friends through this game All I m asking is for people to be more positive and stop predicting doomsday what purpose does that serve in this context I m saying comments like If Life is banned StarCraft is 100 dead serve absolutely no purpose I think that people who think the scene is dead should at least stick by their word and leave You can grief your favorite player bud that s cool no that s Awesome I m just saying also celebrate what s left over and try not to scare people away I m not saying pretend like nothing happened I m saying maybe consider upvoting to 1400 some of the things that we still got going for us and are to come
Hey man thanks for your response I totally agree with you after re reading your article 5 10 times and after cooling off I get your message and you are right This community is perpetually negative in the worst of ways I myself am a content creator I make videos on how to improve etc I will continue to do so and I will continue to do my best to grow the scene and always be a positive force Tonight I was defeated for the first time in awhile when it came to starcraft I felt pretty broken I overreacted and was a lesson learned Thanks for the mature response I spoke strongly and knew the repercussions of my words and was prepared for really negative outlash You ve surprised me in the best of ways Catz keep up the good fight Risk
Hey man your words about Life moved me From the first game I have seen him back when he was just seen as a young talented player I have been in love with how he plays the X factor that he has that cannot be put into words sometimes So thank you for making this video However I will put off having my heart broken until I know some more facts Honestly I cannot imagine Maybe I am in denial as well
When I started watching I thought wtf that s the wrong time for making ironic stupid jokes No I completely agree This is the wrong case to ask for positivity For me though it doesn t really takes anything away from starcraft itself so I don t even know why to talk about what s great about the game It would be horrible if Life is convicted for me personally and many others because we are fans and for him obviously But if so it s only a good thing because it would show that it is possible to get even the biggest name in Korean starcraft if they do matchfixing It would obviously be a shock to the scene but I don t think that it would kill it or even near to that And I honestly think that there was and probably is more going on in Korean starcraft scene Money is big people are young and dumb would be surprized if there isn t more But anyway in Life s case nothing is really known now except he was arrested which horrible on it s own and the rest are rumors horrible rumors
So many people missed the main point of this article It s not about Life s situation It s about the fact that you can t read comments in any starcraft related discussion without being bombarded by negativity I love this game and LOTV is the most fun I ve had with sc2 but I had to take alost a month off from the game purely because the community made it not fun The game didn t do that Blizzard didn t do that This community that can t be happy about anything did that I want to thank my Catz for trying to bring this to attention affect change It s nice to see somebody in the scene trying to help
Hey thanks that means a lot to me to read I really thought I was ready to at least give it a shot but man do I feel defeated and just out of place
Hey thanks for the reply Dont let the negativity drag you down I enjoyed the last event you put on and I ll watch this one too if you go through with it
I will too
Nobody knows anything at all yet and people are already writing articles
The thing is that if there s anything to know about r starcraft is that things will get rowdy regardless of what happens Might as well give you all a heads up Tbh the fact that CatZ feels like he has to do this speaks a lot about the scene
Really I didn t see that at all
to get attention same shit happens every time
This article isn t really about life it more about our ouook on the game and what not The life part was only small part of it
I don t always agree with Catz but we should all appreciate having him in our community I like what catz is saying here and I really hope people lighten the fuck up
I love the game and the people that make it great But the shit talking and whining that comes out of this community this sub in particular is incredible It s ceaseless We shit on people who seek knowledge and want to be positive about the game We isolate and demoralize people who want to get better at the game Do we think that by continually comparing Starcraft 2 to something else be that Brood War LoL etc that it will get better make more money or be more accepted in mainstream gaming It s like being married and continually complaining to your wife and kids about how hot your best friend s wife is It s asinine I don t care how big Starcraft is Obviously I don t want to see it go away but rather continue to be supported by this same intelligent and determined community I ve given money to streamers backed tournaments watched hundreds of hours of everything from online cups between two golds duking it out to Blizzcon and GSL Code S finals I figuratively dragged five people over to watch SOS and Life in December two people they d never heard of playing a game they d never played or particularly cared about We ll see what happens with Life This really sucks But to the best of my knowledge he s still on for next Friday If he s guilty I hope we re able to learn from what happened and move forward Actually I hope we ll be able to do that either way I agree with you Catz This should set a precedent And for his sake I hope he learns something too whatever happens He s not even 20 don t forget I say we all step back for a moment take a deep breath and chill out maybe play some 4v4 monobattles Nobody s ever going to win these arguments We re an online community it s impossible Moreover we re a smart online community playing a smart game and we all have very nuanced and very strong opinions on how it should be
I m glad CatZ wrote this This type of dialogue should be way more common place Community figures in my opinion are supposed to be doing this shit way more We re not here to just suck up views and Jerk each other off on Twitter We are supposed to actively participate in community discussions not stand by and watch the circle jerkers cannibalize the community
Yet you come to jerk CatZ off via Reddit I get your point though Are you considering discussing the SC2 dev teams recent feedback on your next show Seems important now that they are revealing how the community effects them
This is the positive type of jerk though so it s ok
Yeah that s what I meant
he says as my pants remain dry
Well you could consider that English isn t his main language and so he may have been accidentally messed up there Also just because your unhappy doesn t mean you have to be doom and gloom you could be critical but constructive which is more what his article was saying and 9 11 comparison wasn t bad
lol unbelievable What a garbage post You didn t offer anything constructive with this response
FeelsGoodMan
I really dont see the point of anything he said This was such a crowd pleasing karma whoring walking the median dont say anything polarizing article of nothing I didnt take anything at all from this what he is actually saying He is saying that this life thing is the best precedent against match fixing since savior Okay cool last month a entire team was caught matching fixing bw in korea during saviors time was bigger than sc2 will ever be and still match fixing continued cool match mixing is bad and we have a couple new examples really great insight The best player of the past 3 years just got arrested for possible match fixing He wrote a couple paragraphs weakly trying to get a sliver lining out of it Its bad news period Not much else to take from that is he saying to stop with this feelsbadman mentality thats cool weve been saying this since proxy 2 rax got marineking into a finals everyone knows negativity around a game is bad what are you acutally saying Maybe we have a negative attitude because every news article is negative WCS blows player size in sc2 is dying teams players are match fixing the ones who arent are struggling proleague is like half what it used to be so many teams espeically the bigger foreign teams are dying TL is basically the only real functioning pro foreign team right now Besides the release of lotv what has been profoundly positive in the past 6 months we cant even get on the mainstage of dreamhack the fucking tournament sc2 built up no i dont consider one BO7 at 11 am anything significant sc2 is in a real fucking hard spot atm possibly the worst its ever been and thats saying alot because a really awesome expansion just got released and were still declining And please for for the love of god can we stop with this our game is the most demanding highest ceiling jerk me off cause i play this game nonsense Creating carved egg shell art is really hard too does anyone give a fuck about that or vault it to the top of any architect hierarchy This game is beautiful because of so many different things aside from its hard Its actually an insult if that is the one singular aspect of starcraft that we continually trot out there for the community to feel good about itself The negativity is a real thing and we act like adolescences when we try to avoid it and act like its not real sc2 is going to need some serious help to survive The community headfigures of this game are pretty fucking awful i have to say There is no real consistency in any of them what so ever and the ones that do have consistency frankly are not interesting at all Who makes a living streaming producing content off sc2 No one besides fuck head protech or some other people hovering around 200 600 viewers Every other major game has consistent figure heads people can routinely tune into and get attached to Polts stream was just getting consistent that ended God knows where day 9 incontrol destiny huk nony have gone They pop up every now and then then go off for weeks months at a time Honest to god nathanias and avilo are the best most professional consistent streamer in sc2 right now Thats embarassing The europeans are no where to be found TLO snute mana bunny naniwa morrow all stream when they feel like it with no prolonged consistent schedule for people to tune into The koreans definitely never stream Who are the figure heads that guide maintain and grow this community They were there in the beginning and 100 aided the growth of the good ol days Husky day9 HD JP psy DJ wheat incontrol are basically all gone And god knows i love tastosis but they currently are the anti growth for a community They wield so much currency in this scene and refuse to do anything with it besides cast in korea and the occasional preview article Im not mad at these people for making the choices they did its completely their prerogative and decision but we as a community have to realize that we arent replacing these people with anyone capable of replication and are suffering because of it
CATZ I believe the silent majority greatly appreciate all you have done for the SC2 scene We are so much better off for having you Those of us that would say so are often drowned out in the general negatively Keep on being awesome
Well I hope he didn t mean to insult you root because that would be dumb and I d be eternally sad if you left the scene
Yikes Paragraphs dude
Sorry never been too good at those
hes saying cut the crap because I ve brought plenty of my own
My god you re an idiot Please leave the scene if you feel the community sucks so bad and this game has no future You really make this place great
Guy should be an example for everyone in and out of SC2 This is the attitude that gets things right reserves judgement gives benefit to doubt and upholds his position within the ranks of the grand machine This is a rarity to witness well done
love the last paragraph good job catz
This is a really well written post and I recommend everyone who sees this to read it Thank you CatZ Long live SC2
He has to include the memes otherwise like 95 of r sc2 won t read it
deleted
I meant the first sentence of what I quoted We re diving into a new game imo much more fun and interesting than WoL or HotS
Let s cut the crap And let me plug my product
Agree Please read this D
I cannot for the life of me understand the negativity coming into this thread It is absolutely mindboggling
I agree people are can be stupid
I d just like to throw in a note of calm here It s no secret that the sc2 scene was unsustainable and always was This restructuring was in inevitable after kespa joined in It s not very pleasant but its a positive change to keep sc2 going in a manageable form And keep in mind also that many of these retirements from kespa guys would be happening anyway at their age within military service coming up and so forth The only thing that can actually kill off the game as an esport is negativity from the community leading to further depressed interest so lets not do that alright Lets see what we have on the other side of this time of change accept it and enjoy what the future brings
hey guys lets cut the crap I ll lead by example and make an entire post were I stir up more crap for my personal benefit
Hell ya I love the game and it sucks to see the community cannibalize itself and the game with it
I honestly think you project the negativity just like everyone else The absolute majority of this reddit is positive You choose what you want to read and remember
It s really nice to see these kind of threads from people like Catz I really appreciate what he s doing about our scene since day one The sad part is that not many public figures like him are taking part on pushing the negativity off I can understand that many of us have the perception that we shouldn t take this subreddit that seriously BUT we could at least try to create a good communication channel with Blizzard I don t know which medium would be the best for that A new website only for this purpose where people of our community and public figures discuss and promote our game Maybe I m mentioning this because I truly believe that the moderation of this subreddit is not the best The moderators can also help from their side especially when we have threads like psione s which to me is obvious that he s trying to bring the attention where it supposed to be The game Instead you can still read a good amount of retarded comments that are completely irrelevant with the topic I felt really bad that all these idiots actually made David Kim answer about his development team Believe me I ve been on this industry software development for years and I can understand the challenges problems that such a team is facing especially for a huge product like StarCraft something of course that many people can t comprehend including pros casters It would be great if we had more people like Catz especially from the pros casters side that instead of doing A that is ignoring this subreddit because it can be toxic which is true you can do B start getting involved especially now with this current situation Now I know that many of these public figures feel like I ve been doing things for SC since day 1 and that s all true but you can please offer your help knowledge and take part on this You can always do B We love the game and we feel frustrated as well with this situation
For me if this wasn t Life I wouldn t be so nervous but we are talking about the Michael Jordan of our Export If he is caught the entire game is in serious trouble If we re talking about the game seven of Blizzcon we would be talking about the biggest controversy in the history of ESports the only equivalent would be the 1919 black Sox
But it also sets a much needed STRONG precedent for years to come that the presumed behavior won t be tolerated for anyone and that is cause for celebration Life being accused of match fixing whether guilty or not is not a cause for celebration We already know it won t be tolerated look no further than savior The only thing that s happened here is a famous player has been accused of match fixing Obviously lots of people would be upset if he were guilty and if he were innocent people would quickly forget it So not even counting whatever slander arises in the interim there is no positive outcome I mean this isn t 9 11 I can t help anyone All I can do is think well this sucks hopefully it s not true If people feel negatively because their favorite player might be a criminal who are you to say nah man celebrate The only way to cut the crap is to stop talking about this before any facts have been revealed
You can donate money to patreon account to and there by help people in the scene
I love you Catz this is so well written and like you pointed towards it made me think about how people seem to have this intrinsic ability for problemsolving in the midst of hard situations SC2 is really worth fighting for cause in my opinion it is the most beautiful complex game
This is not only well said but exactly what we NEED to hear Puts things in perspective Gives us a dose of truth bombs and will hopefully help us all improve our attitudes from here on out Thanks Catz
I told em on twitter and I will say it here I appreciate Catz trying to be a positive figure for the scene There is no reason to hate the game you play It is self defeating and stagnates any potential for growth
Why is it that the people banging the drum for relentless positivity have all previously run crowdfunding projects Coincidence
Because negative people complaining all the time don t do shit except whining Saying dedgaem for years has not helped one single bit Shitting on people who try to keep the scene alive will probably not help either
catz iz right we gotta stay positive as a community please ffs I dont want to be the emo kids of esports i already did that in HS and it sucked
I think the pessimism stems from how big Starcraft used to be in the past and how the present isn t living up to it Couple that with the fact that MOBAs and CSGO are pretty dominant in the currrent eSports scene and you get this overwhelming negativity Of course Life s arrest didn t help
deleted
SC2 is never 100 screwed If Life gets banned SC2 will still exist We will still have a WCS and we ll get great games to watch and I hope to be there at Blizzcon or the WCS finals because it s always exciting to be there Hopefully he isn t done because I love to see him play
you think Blizzard is going to issue a recall and confiscate your copy of the game because Life broke the law
Opinions like yours are the whole reason I wrote this if that is truly how you feel if that is really what you believe I honestly hope that if Life gets banned you stick to your thoughts and stop following SC2 I think that if we are to welcome new people in we have to stop being overly negative and toxic I don t see how sc2 can ever grow with this type of mindset but I honestly believe that there is plenty of room for growth because it is the best most challenging game out there
People who conflate the esports scene with SC2 s health as a game are why SC2 s esports scene is in dire shape People care about games they play And few people play games because of its esports scene People play games they like to play If SC2 is a fun game it ll have a user base and by virtue of that an esports scene whatever personalities are on it If SC2 sucks as a game there is no esports personality that ll save it
If Life is being accused of matchfixing I only see two possibilities 1 it happened in 2010 11 before he got famous 2 he was somehow forced to it by threats I can t understand how someone who makes 100k a year could benefit enough from matchfixing sc2 games to do it from free will Even if someone that popular didn t care about getting defamed it wouldn t even make financial sense since any chance of getting caught would mean end of the career If it s 1 I m personally inclined to forgive it He d get banned for sure but I m not going to become hater if he was pulled into it as that young And I have no idea if 2 actually is a something that ever happens outside movies but it makes more sense than him throwing games in hopes of gains like 1 5k in years 2012 15
it could also be he knew about something and just kept his mouth shut since most people don t wana touch that with a 10 foot pole
Life is a gambler as well that s no secret I m not saying that he did anything wrong I m pointing out there are likely more than 2 scenarios possibilities as you seem to believe for which any person in the world especially someone you don t personally know could feel driven to do wrong
Yeah I had hard time believing he could have motive to do it on himself throwing own matches But certainly he could be anything even on organizing side Wish they just came up with more precise statement before rumors spread too much
Calling everyone a hacker in game and generally acting like an asshole online ProTech is such a nice guy indeed
Maybe you should check out his YouTube channel he analyzes replays and breaks them down and calls out cheaters etc Let s cut the crap the community is a joke and he is one of the few to make a stand

Do you even know what a prosecutor s job is Protip you don t get investigated by them if you break some shit in a bar
i love how he still thinks his opinion is relevant
It has a descent mount of upvotes so I would say he Does have a relevant opinion
that doesnt mean shit especially on sc subreddit
I love how you act like your opinion is relevant
It s only an issue with presentation The posts that said they were increasing it to last for 20 seconds said they were increasing it from 15 seconds to 20 seconds it only lasted 11 real seconds to begin with the 15 seconds was blizzard time So it s not like they intended to change it to 20 real seconds and fucked up they intended to increase it to 20 blizzard seconds and did so The patch is live post says from 11 seconds to 14 seconds They never should have said change it from 15 to 20 and that was confusing since they switched the game clock to use real seconds they should only communicate in real seconds but the change is what it was meant to be
Well it makes sense to use Blizzard time since they don t know what game speed you ll be playing at Not everyone plays just 1v1 ladder
balance changes only affect multiplayer where game speed is fixed
They also affect playing customs vs AI which can have a different game speed
Remember switching from Blizzard time to real time after nearly 17 years of it being the standard competition speed was a huge change that will probably take the development team a little bit to figure out
Of course when you take a look in the map editor s data module all of the values there look normal and rounded as they are intended for normal setting No 71 14 seconds and such They just didn t consider it properly when they should which means start of the engine development maybe
They originally made the game for normal game speed which was based on the normal game speed from the original Starcraft They hadn t yet decided how fast the game was actually going to be played
Maybe I wonder if it would be beneficial if for the next year or until people get this oddity figured out they should list times in both Blizzard seconds and real seconds
Also weapon speed is 0 71 which equals one second on faster setting before the time change for LotV
I m just an outsider but I believe it s because the engineers still work with Blizzard Time due to the underlying engine still using it Patch notes will probably continue to be posted in Blizz time I could be wrong tho
Yeah guys 20 seconds 14 seconds per Blizzard So if my calculations are correct ladder revamp will be here in 2 months and 20 days Someone check my math Edit Math 23 minutes 14 seconds Based on what Blizzard has given us with their time calculations we can use a proportional equation to figure out when ladder revamp will be here Let s convert seconds to minutes 23min 3min This reflects the first part of the equation 14seconds 20seconds Now lets turn months into seconds So there are 263520 minutes in 6 months accounting for the months that have an extra day So the equation will look like this 23 3 x 263520 X Is blizzard time So you cross multiply and divide finding that 6 months 202032 minutes in blizzard time Therefore ladder revamp will be here in roughly 2 months and 20 days
Please consider the soon tm constant and redo your math
fuck I hate logarithms
fuck i hate integrals
fuck i hate 3 dots
Lol
this is the negative unscontructive criticism dayvie was talking about
It s a joke
Has a joke to be funny for it beeing a joke
Funny or not it s a joke not negative unconstructive criticism
Okay its a dump unfunny joke But at least its a joke
So wait did Blizzard fuck up again or did we just read this wrong
I think they just made the change ignoring new clock
yes totally
From what I ve heard the Blizzard guys who write patch notes write them using the game s internal time system which is still using Blizzard Time AFAIK none of the patch notes have been in real time
The beta patch notes were updated I think At least if I recall correctly one of the patches increased the liberator move speed and it was not in blizzard time
They ve been putting patch notes in blizz seconds every time I guess it s easier for them
Also just tested it it s only 14 seconds
To be fair this was probably on the test map for us right
So both changes were made with old time so they don t last as long as advertised but have higher dps than advertised Is that how it is
Technically yes But it s still the same ratio That is it lasts 1 5 times as long as it used to
Basically DPS now is 30 0 71 42 With how they said it it was 30 1 30 Seems significant but let s wait for the eventual response from Blizzard if there s going to be one
Accidental balance O
Mine says 33 seconds P No photoshop no mods Ruins of Seras 0 7
welp all the time numbers for units on the official sc2 page arent updated yet as well so yeah they didnt get around to do all that yet I guess
Doesn t this make it a pretty big nerf rather than just forcing the placement into being more strategic instead of spammable I feel like that could undo PO s whole point of existence though i could be more wrong than i think
No They just used the old time scale It was changed as we expected it to be
I was under the assumption everyone de constructing the changes was using 20 sec as their timeframe
The duration was supposed to be 10 secs I guess that they decided to up it to 14 Oh well I won t complain
Blizzard is retarded just timed it on my phone and its 14 seconds
you are retarded indeed
Let me be the first to say that i m glad they listened to our feedback about the spore nerf that would have made ZvZ boring as hell
That would have been too much Mutas are already still pretty good even with 90 damage parabomb and spores If they had tried to do two indirect buffs to mutas at the same time we would have some crappy zvzs for a while As much as I would rather have a logical buff like hydras do more damage vs air or something the spore damage is kind of needed given how lackluster zerg AA is
you aren t the first to say it but i m glad we agree
that spore nerf came out of nowhere it was a good thing they scrapped it also fucking finally they patch the game
Maybe not out of nowhere http mamchenkov net wordpress 2012 07 23 a duck
its a hotfix that is live in NA if u try to use PO it takes 50 energy no announcment on launcher its a hotfix that you dont need to download
I liked the top comment on the page Maybe one day you realize PO is altogether bad for the game Remove it and give Protoss early game options to counter play in the form of units There is zero excitement in watching PO fight back an opponent by itself edit as for my feeback I d rather see defensive structures used instead such as Photon Canons Maybe Photon overcharge canons instead of pylons since they are meant to defend anyways
Chronoboost photon cannons for increased attack speed
Dude Why did nobody think of this Seriously
Because it doesn t solve the issue it just makes spending at least 150 on an unmovable cannon now a necessity instead of an option limiting Protoss s ability to make meaningful early game choices Give protoss better early game units Drop PO and FF buff the zealot or add back in the dragoon to give protoss heavier hitters against early pushes anything is better than forcing us to build an immovable building that shoots slightly faster when chronoboostef
What you just said applies to Terran and zerg as well Say I m zerg and a Terran is flying a banshee to my base building a spore crawler is minerals you SHOULD spend Same goes for missle turrets Having units only isn t the best option Having static defense is a smart option The way it s implemented with the pylon is just wierd because pylons are for power and photon canons are for defense
I think we re making two entirely different points here Yes I agree that the PO Cannon relationship is whack at the moment But that doesn t mean that the solution to Protoss problems is to restrict player choice to build more photon cannons to stop a push at the front which would be the result All that does is force Protoss players to drop money on static defense in every situation and limit the real choices they can make in the early game
If someone is throwing cloak banshees muta flocks oracles at your bases you re REALLY gonna WANT to make some static D It is an option already and it is the smart option In lower leagues the option changes to I want to build two turrets here because my map awareness isn t as good As for frontal attacks early game I agree you shouldn t have to lose because you were 1 canon down and I think it s even worse now that it s 1 pylon down because pylons are meant to be power supplies to other buildings not defense Thats where I think stronger early game units and canons come into play mostly units because canons should be defending mineral lines or landing zones instead We are making entirely different points and I agree with your point that Protoss should have stronger early game units but you should have probably posted your idea somewhere else
I m talking about your opinion on forcing players to build static D as the only means of defending a push at the front Not your response to some other guys suggestion
Hey You re a balance genius Why don t you design your own game
Its problematic because buffing Toss gateway units make early gateway timings really tough to stop because of warp in
They could just move warp gate tech back a bit Perhaps it would require a twilight council
You would still get broken 3 base timings this way
What about getting rid of PO and giving Mothership Core Shield recharge ability Limited amount of recharges would be helpful in small battles early game but not that much important in the big battles mid and endgame
Or people just like to use this meme without actually knowing what is going on Your reasoning for not liking PO is basically saying all static defense is even worse since it takes even less work At least try and come up with a good reason for PO being bad than it s boring
it s boring is a great reason for something to be bad in a game
The early game in WoL was much more interesting and having no PO was one reason for that
if they removed it the entire sc2 community would cheer
Only the people who dislike it are vocal about it Nobody makes new threads on forums about the things they like it would be just a flood of spam that way
And protoss are too afraid to say anything at all
I don t understand what you are trying to get across
Well not really just JaK and a few people on reddit pretty much
Yeah because if they just straight up removed PO then ZvP and TvP are pretty much walkover wins
well obviously they should add something else
Why not reduce Gateway warp in time as well as Zealot warp in time Wouldn t affect late game much as everyone goes Warp Gate
This is a very very good balance update for three main reasons I m one of those people that believes Photon Overcharge has a place in the game and that the LotV version of the ability is very good unlike Heart of the Swarm which absolutely killed strategies such as 1 1 1 or tank play in PvT The problem with the old PO was that its uptime was far too frequent yet its damage wasn t truly bursty enough to hold midgame drop pressure A one damage point reduction to Adepts actually makes them three shot Marines and three shot SCVs instead of two shot them This nerf only really affects PvT where Adepts are seen as a massive problem Parasitic Bomb was ridiculously overpowered A 33 damage decrease is what the ability needed It s still strong just not stupidly so I just wish they d make Mech more viable now
Simple analysis of the change of Photon Overcharge Duration increased from 11 seconds to 14 seconds Weapon period decreased from 0 89 seconds to 0 71 second Energy cost increased from 25 to 50 This means that you ll get 20 shots since 14 0 71 19 7 for 50 energy that s 42 2 dps 30 0 71 or 600 damage 20 30 Before it was 13 shots 11 0 89 12 4 for 25 energy and 33 7 dps 30 0 89 or 390 damage 13 30 Just to make it easier to compare it
I m for getting rid of PO altogether Instead make the mothership core into more of a beastly unit Give it attack vs armored that doesn t increase based on upgrades so it won t destroy in the late game won t affect harrassing mineral lines devastating against early give it speed to not be abused by stim timings help move between bases queens are already made ad nauseum in the meta for defense change the PO cast to a spell which increases attack speed and range for 7 seconds with a cool down of like 15 seconds most early game fights are decided before this cooldown would wear off As far as ZvZ Mutalisks are ridiculous Give Hydras attack vs bio air Take away like a half second from Infested Terran hatching helps against Warp Prism and drop play as well As far as Terran make Ghosts cheaper make their snipe cost more make their energy replenish faster make Ghost Academy build faster make nukes longer to make Make Liberators upgrade also give it damage vs shield EDIT I m going for making the game reward control instead of rewarding sitting back I am not good at mech so I don t feel like I can weigh in on how to make it better but I d love for it to center around Thors or a Thor like unit EDIT 2 Thinking about this makes me feel Protoss air could get overly powerful late game Maybe a small reduction of gas for Vipers or health a small bit
At least get rid of Central Protocol and Lerilak Crest Lerilak has been around since the beta and Central Protocol has a terrible layout with a terrible tileset Hard to see things on the minimap
I think if they removed those two maps gave us the GSL maps instead and removed the gold bases on Prion the ones in the middle can stay that would already make a lot of people very happy It would be so much better for season 1 of LotV and those changes are not hard to make Please Blizzard show us that you can respond fast and change your plans Just do this and prove that you care
I think that the gsl maps are too graphically challenging for lots of pc
Blizzard could always remove some of the doodads
Well they often change a bunch of stuff anyway when they make them into the LE They could remove some effects
I d really like to know the veto rate for those two maps
Probably 66 6 All the Terran s and Protoss s
I might be one of the outliers here but I like TvP on Leriliak Crest That said I pray I never get TvZ on any map these days But I do HATE HATE HATE Central Protocol Vetoed all the way baby
Actually I don t veto lerilak as a zerg because I love doing ling run by s in my opponent s nat
I actually flop my vetos around Central Protocol I ve actually never played on to give it a fair shake I hate main base rocks I generally keep Seras voted because the natural ramp is so huge and it really really sucks TvP So I flop between Prion and Larilak Lately I keep Prion vetoed because TvZ on that map I consider unwinnable unless I completely and absolutely cheese out
It s kind of funny how none of the races really like playing on central protocol They really should remove at least that map Lerilak is a bit too zerg favored due to the open natural so it should probably be removed too Prion is fine if they remove the gold bases
knowing blizzard it will take them a month to consider removing it and then another month to find out how to remove it fml
And replace it with inferno pools with that imbalanced gold ba oh wait we have even worse gold map in prion
I said this exact thing in another thread and was downvoted to hell Central Protocol is just hard on the eyes and it s not easy to differentiate low from high ground
first map I have vetoed in my 5 5 year StarCraft career
They re holding a map contest I m sure there looking to replace it
But only for ladder season 2 We re still in 2015 ladder season 4 There s a whole other ladder season where we ll have central protocol and lerilak in the map pool
I ve been playing since WoL bad maps don t scare me
Did their post say please tell us what you want changed for the season that s about to start Because you are ranting about something they are NOT going to change instead of being negative let s focus on what they actually asked which is new maps for next season
LeiLark crest or whatever has been horrible map since beta opened Same with seras
For some reason the time those maps were used in beta does not seem to count
Lol in the announcement they said they want players to have more time on the maps since they feel lotv launch to season 1 end was too short and so we d want more time on the maps I have a feeling these folks hardly play sc2 otherwise they d understand that we are bored of these maps and want new ones sigh
I m not sure why crest in particular stuck around for so long Its just plain badly designed map that should have been gone long ago Prion would be good if the 3rd wasn t gold but muh map diversity when game just came out and balance is off must be priority
Different maps bring out more interesting and diverse games They really should make a map consisting only of gold bases Also unrelated Can t even remember since how long I have been playing Orbital Lerilak and Seras
Since at least July I thought dream pool was bad the shitty cheese pool was bad then this season came over with just silly silly badly designed and plain badly thought out maps
Because most people were still playing HotS and or not playing when those maps came out Because the game is significantly different than the start of beta
Seras is even worse to be perfectly honest as a zerg It s chalk full of bullshit from protoss with blink and sentry drops XD
They both fucking suck and so do prion
Yeah regardless og game if its not on Dusk Tower i dont like the map lol
They already said no new maps due to the short time since launch so this shouldn t have been a surprise to anyone How about we focus in new maps for next season like they asked instead of all whining
Yes they said it but when every popular streamer and every gamer I follow has said the mappool is really really bad something like that should actually be adressed Its not like its a button on the UI screen we talk about here
I think Destiny said he didn t think the map pool was that bad in TLG
I just don t understand how they can expect people to keep playing every season when they add nothing new to the table other than very minor balance changes Heroes of the storm gets a new hero every 3 weeks new maps constant balance changes These shitty maps are really all they could come up with for LOTV They should have someone on their team making 4 or 5 new maps for every season Skins should be coming regularly not all at once at a to be determined far in the future date The new ladder system should have been in at release they had nearly three years between HOTS launch and LOTV launch to come up with a new ladder system
They don t even need to make maps We have so many community made maps at least a couple of them can replace the really shitty maps like Lerilak and Central
Even Diablo3 has exciting changes with every season to keep people playing and reaper of souls was the last expac that came out years ago It s fucking laughable the way sc2 is treated by blizzard sometimes
they do that with D3 because they released such a shitty base game with the original SC2 is damn good as it is although new better maps would be great
It s because they believe that RTS genre shouldn t follow the popular trend of frequent patches and updates They always say player s money is on the line and it s extremely dangerous to go through such big changes often That is bullshit Other games with even bigger prize pool gets constant patches And it s not like only certain players are being affected by it The only reason why they are doing it is because they are following the Broodwar era s philosophy However we have to realize these two games are very different In Broodwar the game barely got any balance updates and patches Do you know why Because Broodwar did not need them Yeah there were still balance whines and complaints but the biggest difference is that even with minor balance complaints people still enjoyed the game and the scene pro and casual still thrived without much patches But SC2 is different This game compared to its predecessor is no where near perfect I honestly think Blizzard was pretty lucky to make a game like BW But SC2 needs changes Major changes it s already getting pretty boring with LotV to be honest because apart from the mineral worker change it s the same old shit that s been around in HotS
These maps been pretty terrible yea
I think blizzard fucked up massivly when they set the release date for LotV so early Skins Voicepacks ladderrevamp bugfixes everything should have already been in the game when they released it For myself I don t care I will continue to play starcraft anyway and I m happy whenever they improve the game But there are alot of players that already left the game again because LotV feels like playing on a building site Combined with the fact they won t take out a map as dumb as central protocol because apparently it s intresting this was a very dissapointing community update in my eyes
To add to this the tournament system seemed so rushed Wc3 tournaments were nightly varied each day and included the entire server Sitting around and waiting to play a few games with some random people that signed up is not what I expected It s a fucking waste of time And they run every 90 minutes And the reward is a stupid trophy saying you won It s the laziest shit I ve seen from Blizz in a while and that s saying something I will say this the game has improved slightly Protoss is actually fun to play as and game flow is better But all the interface stuff and new features is the same old half assed shit
I know a lot of people who really love the tournament system But I see it the same way as you It s a waste of time You play Bo1 with 3 vetos just like in ladder But you have to wait for the opponents all the time and the MMS is pretty shit in tournaments at least for gm
Yep preponing the release was a bad move as I share that sentiment playing an early access game somehow and that s exactly what I feared when they announced it As much as I want myself to love the game like I did the past 5 years Blizzard is really giving me a tough time doing so as of late
I don t agree with this at all We got a new UI a new campaign new co op mode new Archon mode tournaments new multi units and new economy Adding more content after launch does not make Void a building site It means Blizzard is supporting the product in a way that they never did for HotS and WoL Instead of punishing them try thanking them instead
Yes people are calling this a construction project Lol look at all the features the game has the multiplayer is phenomenal still and the game has blizzards Polish I ve never heard so much noise over so little issues Also you can turn off maps you don t like I don t get how that makes the game a construction site if it has a map you don t want
I understand your point and it s absolutely true that LotV came with a lot of updates and that it s good that Blizzard continue to support it but LotV would have been a much better product if it had launched with the ladder update with skins and voice packs etc Right now it feels like some of the features that are most likely to keep people invested in the game are still far off and a lot of players will have lost interest when they are finally released The Void launch seemed like the best chance for Blizzard to capture and hold on to a bigger playerbase but since many of the features that could have helped with the longevity of the playerbase aren t out yet they might have missed their window when they finally do arrive I hope I m wrong though
Don t get me wrong I really love StarCraft and it s really my personal feelings about the game so feel free to disagree good for you if you enjoy the game as much as you apparently do But it s not exactly like that for everybody so please consider those people as well Aside from co op and the new campaign there has been little stuff for players who for instance got into beta early The UI change is purely cosmetical so it doesn t add much value to me therefore it s kinda nice eye candy but not relevant for playing the game in the end it comes down to personal preference what brings us to the most important aspect playing the game I for my part don t like the economy changes as much and I would ve welcomed extended testing periods with different approaches in this area also the focus on ability heavy units is something I personally don t like as much So I ve played the campaign did some co op but after just a few weeks the hype was kinda gone for me as all that was left were announcements
I d trash almost all of that for a ladder revamp race specific mmr and a new map pool The game is only still around because the 1v1 is so amazing if they think co op did anything for the community they are kidding themselves
Idk I agree with you the multi player does feel incomplete However I feel the viewerbase and playerbase was in a pretty bad place towards the end of HotS If Blizzard had waited another 6 months it would lose a lot more momentum for the series than we are seeing now Blizz s argument would be that the skins and voice packs were always supplementary never part of the core game
How does it feel incomplete The whole game is there plus more features Skins and voice packs can come and go
Blizzard trying to make sure that all that s left of the hype around LotV is gone by the time they eventually bring any of the things they announced at Blizzcon before the launch This is just ridicolous
shitting my pants lmao
This was the biggest reason I was hyped for LotV and the thing that had me the most excited My excitement would have been ultra gimped if I d had known it was potentially coming in late 2016
It makes me wonder what exactly Blizzard has been doing for the past three years Street Fighter V comes out in a couple weeks so I ll just say goodbye to playing Starcraft for now Maybe later in the year we ll have good maps better balance design a decent ladder system and incentives to play Maybe not
It makes me think that they literally have one or two people working on this game at a time
Sadly it s their own fucking fault MONETIZE THE GAME ALREADY FFS Tons of us will gladly throw away money to have our zerglings wear stupid hats or whatever the fuck they can think of And the extra income will provide some revenue for them and justification for further support rather than just a sink into a game that has had it s popularity decline
Skins for buildings instant
I ve already spent 220 dollars on this game like 10x what I ever payed on LoL
At this point I d be happy if they threw a gofundme page up asking for money to pay programmers just so we could get the features we actually fucking want faster It would be incredibly sad on their part but better than taking 9 months to split the ladder into smaller sections and add mmr for each race Do they have one guy working part time on this or what
Also the fact they don t change maps already Can t be to much work changing one of the gold minerals on prion into a blue expansion
Or put some rocks there What ever happened to destructible rocks at expansions
Dustin Rock Browder is putting them in Heroes now
Really
No I don t know anything about Heroes But it would be funny
No rocks yet I m seriously disappointed by the lack of rocks Fingers crossed for a rocks hero later down the track
They got a tremendous amount of shit about there being too many rocks on their ladder maps a couple years back So now there are less rocks
They get a tremendous amount of shit about the third being a gold
Sure I m just pointing out they probably won t add rocks to solve that problem Idk why they don t change it into a regular base
Rocks having 3 armor really screws over zerg more than the other two by a huge margin esp when combined with the general idea that zerg needs to expo faster and that zerglings are melee so not all can attack at once
exactly i cant tell whats happening behind the scenes but the whole thing with the Mappool not changing sounds like a lazy excuse It s sad to see my favourite game disappointing me in such a stupid way
deleted
heroes of the strom is their priority for some reason they get a lot of shit done with that game even though lycan said that the current sc2 team is the biggest it has ever been and is fully focussed on sc2 lol
They now have 3 guys working on sc2 now Thats like three times more before
Heroes makes them money over time Theres a financial incentive to constantly update Until skins voice packs paid commanders mission packs are available Starcraft does not make them money over time As a fan it sucks but I can totally see why they would prioritize other games at the moment
Well considering their ladder team is independent of all the other teams I doubt it
i just might stop playing wait for the new ladder
if the only thing you care about is a numeric rank you should really stop
i dont really care about rank i care if blizzard is caring i dont think they are
I ve only been following SC2 on and off what s the main issues with the ladder at the moment and why is everyone hoping for an upgrade
Why They said it would be sometime in 2016 What made you think it would be this early
They delayed 2016 season 1 with a month my guess was they done this because they need an extra monht for working on the ladder revamp
Key word here is guess
Because it was announced at Blizzcon in fucking November
and completely redesigning the ladder takes only 2 3 months of course right Because after the countless iterations and changes made during the design process obviously this takes only 3 4 weeks and Blizz employees work on Christmas and weekends the implementation is super simple there are never any bugs in the code and no design changes after noticing that there are still some problems or edge cases Then you just put some UI together in 2 3 days because it takes no time at all to design and code that After all of that you don t need to test anything or do quality assurance right Because obviously this is all super simple and there s no way anything can go wrong And even if it does it s just the main ladder feature of the most competitive game in the world Who cares Just roll out a patch later Shouldn t take more than like a day to fix these bugs right I guess Blizzards developers are just lazy
You seem reasonable I like that
Who announces something on which they ve done absolutely zero work
They did announce it saying that it was something that they were going to work on as in future tense This is still absurdly long for IMO one of the only features in lotv I cared about
tbf that does seem like exactly the sort of thing Blizzard would do these days
yes they presented their plans for the future of their games blizzcon wasnt a fucking patch note do you have 0 ideea about what goes on in game development or in a computer
It should be rolled out as close to launch as possible hence people s optimism that it would be early 2016 But then when Blizzard says they re hoping for early 2nd half for Blizzard that really means late 2nd half at best early 2017 at worst I think that s why people are upset
Second part of the year I m out
Seriously This is so disappointing I might revisit SC in 6 months but for now I m out too
yeah i took a break from the game the last 2 weeks expecting the ladder revamp to come with the new season Nope guess I m done with the game
This is a cruel fucking joke It is a joke right right
I stopped laddering excited for the new maps Waiting 6 months is atrocious Fuck off blizzard hand over operational tasks to others You clearly struggle with the development as it is
Heroes of the Storm has an almost continuously active PTR releases new content every 3 4 weeks and has pushed two balance patches since coming back from the holidays And the SC2 team won t update the map pool for another 3 months And how on Earth are you so starved for resources that the ladder revamp as in those common sense changes the community has been asking for since two expansions ago is going to take a further six months Again Heroes of the Storm has revamped its ladder several times over the last six months with an even further far more radical change than anything envisaged for SC2 due to drop soon too This is maddening and would be unacceptable in any other game in Blizzard s line
Yo Heroes got NO updates for a solid two months before that though Don t cherry pick in arguments I agree with you but this sort of behavior damages your authority
here are the four patches they released from October to December They include the release of four new heroes a new battleground and several balance updates http us battle net heroes en blog 19981657 http us battle net heroes en blog 19960704 http us battle net heroes en blog 19923883 heroes of the storm patch notes october 20 2015 10 20 2015 http us battle net heroes en blog 19893628 heroes of the storm patch notes october 6 2015 10 6 2015
Eh I find the lack of a new ladder for sc2 similar to the issue of the lack of grandmaster and bans in HotS
Heroes of the storm s PTR wasn t updated for a few months up until the le ming update thing a few days ago though Other than that they re two very different games with very different development cycles w very different amounts of work going to different places Not that blizzard hasn t obviously dropped the ball on a ton of things here but comparing sc2 with HotS doesn t really slide
I m not saying SC2 needs to be on Heroes release schedule My point is that they have the tools and the skills to do something rather than nothing and since so much of the architecture and development team is shared between both games the only thing stopping them is their own decision making They choose to invest virtually no time into SC2
The basic architecture yeah the engine is pretty modified though Is there overlap between sc2 and HotS I feel like that s probably not true considering that team is constantly doing things that d prevent them from working on other things I wouldn t say they aren t investing any time into sc2 though just that the internal team working on the multiplayer isn t
Heroes isn t a great example I m we can all go over the Heroes reddit and read about the need for Bans and a stale meta all day long
At least they get new content more often then once every year and a half
ladder fixes improvements should be on top of their priority list apart from balance changes not at the bottom
No new maps zzzzzzzz
I m with you but Bliz would probably consider that a defeat I think their pride in a faulty principle is more important to them than keeping players
If the game is improved we all win That s the only win lose paradigm
Also remove Central Shitical That map is beyond hotfix
they work slow af it makes me think they are not dedicating enough resources to Starcraft
Ladder change should have happend with the release of legacy of the void not almost a year later congrats blizzard you fucked up again
No no the current ladder system is fine Pros are still figuring it out Lets just wait and see s
whats wrong with the ladder now honest question been away for a bit
They changes they are making are to make it easier to tell where your mmr is at and how close to promoting demoting you are as well as add seperate mmr for each race These are things people wanted since WOL and they promised them before LOTV and are now releasing them a year after LOTV they had so much time to work on something most of the community wanted and instead added a bunch of stuff most of the community could care less if they had built or not
Jesus he forgot to mention the game is still in early access
While I were hoping for the ladder rework to come sooner I am glad we at least got a update Blizz really deserves a lot of credit for their improvements in communication The difference between this last year and the year before is staggering While I understand having the maps stay for another season I really hoped they would at least remove lerilak It s such a boring map not to mention ugly I don t mind maps being weird or creative or whatever but the map simply does not look good The balance changes seem good but I wish they would explain why they removed the thor change It looked like it could be a fun change I am looking forward to the content they are creating they really seem to be making a lot of effort to support Starcraft
They used to not do anything now they tell us they are doing nothing Great
It s like the shit I took this morning is better than the shit I took last night
Apparently the Thor buff turned out to be too much everything died too fast to mass Thor
More like liberator killed everything too fast while thor dealt with shit that killed libs
Fucking kidding me
Why cant blizzard just show my fucking mmr It would be enough of a start
Im with you man These maps are fucking pathetic and someone deserves to be fired for this decision
hahaha I love it
Glad to see that suggestions from the community are getting attention I m really looking forward to archon and team tournaments but sadly this will take a while Skins and Coop Updates aren t really new information but this is ok since we learn about an achievement skin I m excited about They talked about a broad selection so I m excited for that black protoss buildings like in the cmpaign It s sad to see that the ladder improvements are now in the second half of this year which makes the waiting time at least 5 months which is A LOT Bugs are getting fixed as they should be Decent update
Full on Tal darim skins for all protoss units buildings would be great instant purchase if they weren t too overtly expensive
Looking at hots skin prices though uh
Eh i d probably shell out 20 for a full set of unit building skins I might be less inclined to do so on Tal darim skins considering they re already in the game for every protoss unit building and the only work there would be to set them as skins but still
Seeing hots skins cost 10 but is free game I wouldn t really like 20 skins But then again I paid 15 for nova dlc so I could get the ghost skin
The ones with custom voice work themed abilities tend to be 15 20 but yep
I ll buy sweet 20 skins all day if it means they put more than 2 interns on SC2
Personally I think blizzard has done a great job communicating with the player base They tell you exactly what they are thinking how they are approaching the situation and what to expect in the following updates Disregarding the hate towards Blizzard by some people They really have done a great job
Half the blog is saying they re not bringing any new features and making excuses as of why They re promising new stuff sure but they re being very vague with what and when This is probably why people are so disappointed Valve on the other hand never promises anything do not communicate with their playerbase like this they just release features patches when they re done But I do not agree with either of these methods
But valve really listen the comunnity feedback After every patch there is sub patchs fixing broken shits Everytime some bug weird shit happens they fix it They listen what the comunnity want how to improve the compendium
The problem is they aren t listening to the community about what is a priority and are instead just doing whatever the fuck they think we want
uninstall exe
Diverse map pool again hype Hype HYPE HYYYYPPPPEEEEE not
Maybe its just me i never liked this map pool Dusk Tower is comfortable and pretty the other maps seem pretty shit not enjoyable to play on Biggest thing im waiting for is ladder changes and skin i want that cool Ultralisk you see Oh fuck yea anti hack launcher would be amazing so annoying to meet so many hackers all the time
As always better to communicate the bad news such as no imminent changes to maps or ladder system or things taking longer than we hoped than keep us guessing Thanks
Normally I d probably be disappointed but they made the timeline clear since the panel discussion during Blizzcon Ladder update Q2 Nova Ops sometime mid year and then skins and voice packs after that I don t know why everyone is acting so surprised I m disappointed with the ladder distribution though I thought I am going to get an easier time into a larger Masters but that doesn t seem to be the case I suck too much to make top 2
Team Tournaments planned but wont happen till you brought out ladder rework which you want to release in half a Year How many people are working on this Because it sounds like something around 2
Anyone know what time they re aiming to release the patch
Why no new maps My 2vs2 buddy said a week ago he won t play again until they change the maps So remain the 2vs2 maps also unchanged or does this only affect 1vs1
It s honestly fucking pathetic that we have to tolerate these shit maps for another season Some of these are approaching a year being part of the LoTV pool reaching all the way back to beta It is absolutely baffling that Blizzard has an entire section of the community making awesome maps and yet refuses to implement them Taking out Central Protocol and Lerilak why were these maps put in the game in the first place and substituting them with the GSL maps would even be a very positive change but nope Another 3 months of possibly the worst overall map pool in the history of the game I really just don t fucking know anymore guys
My interest in SC just keeps on diminishing I want to keep playing but damn So basically within the past few months all Blizzard has done is changed a few variables on the unit stats I m seriously convinced that they ve secretly cut the cord on this game They re clearly putting no resources into it whatsoever There s major bugs and they just put it aside for some unspecified future update And then there s the separate race MMR they ve been going on about forever I want to play the other races as a way to keep my interest in the game and I got a feeling I ll be waiting forever All I can say is that LotV so far has been really really disappointing
It s official I m not playing in S1 These maps are terrible All the maps run in a certain race s favor way too heavily Central Protocol lings x x they re not fun I can t do anything specific to a certain map there s not even a sweet spot map for something cool Fuck I HATE THESE MAPS
Okay I am done Two years of development just for a broken MP and a decent campaign dunno why I bought LotV probably because shit heads in this community convinced me that Blizzard will soon add after release a reworked ladder system and unit skins voice packs yet nothing is dated or official But neither Blizzard or the SC2 community are known to hold their words
Why did ppl expect ladder overhaul before June Honest question Something like this takes time and knowing Blizzard and their other games I was sure we won t see it happening before summer
wow damn The Ladder changes were delayed until 2nd half of this year That is the most disappointing thing in this update second being no new maps for next season
Ugh the same maps ResidentSleeper
It looks like they have a lot to do I m upset with how upset reddit is getting over not catering to reddit s every wish Software is complicated guys Things come up Backlogs get full It happens
How can you NOT look at the statistics so far in tournaments and qualifiers and think to yourself Hm maybe the mappool is just god aweful for 2 3 of the races in this game Fucking mindblowing
YEA So when Blizzard communicates about the changes and when it s happening You guys all cry like babies See why companies don t like to communicate about their internal work If you want more transparancy STOP crying when a new feature doesn t come out tomorow It won t changes a SINGLE thing Blizzard works hard for us and Sc2 Thank you
In contrast to all the wiener whiners I am very happy with all those community feedbacks and the way Blizzard is working on SC2 With no further expansion on the line I m pretty sure the game will develop alot in the upcoming two years Keep on Blizzard you re doing great
they are doing things too slowly
A new achievement skin coming soon Is it supposed to be a single skin or a skin for each race Or do they just mean the Nova DLC skin This interests me more than any other change
atleast get rid of the maps that were from the beta are we actually going to have those maps for a year
I find this disappointing that the potential for individual race MMR MIGHT fall under the first half of this year so maybe June July we ll see something on this The game may already be degrading in population by then and individual race MMR would help greatly in allowing flexibilities of races on ladder IMO
Pretty disgusting how long it takes them to make very simple changes for problems that they have known about for months and years right heh I m reminded every day of their mediocrity when I see the borders of my friends as plat and diamond when they are actually GM Thank you Blizzard
and it s safe to say that the current maps haven t been fully figured out Idk kev
Hrm I like central protocol Forces me to do non standard stuff on ladder I think that s something we should have on at least one map in the pool I like having maps that are either favoring or prohibitive to certain strategies I ve played only around 150 1v1 games this season but I don t mind it I personally veto the big open 4player maps Lerilak Crest and Ruins of Seras because once I get beyond 4 bases I m just guessing on what I m doing macro wise and praying my army didn t just disintegrate
That moment when you realize that on weekends Warcraft 3 has more players than SC2 Guess I know what to do until next year
wut show the s
https imgur com DrGOD41 for war 3 https imgur com gxGxueg for sc2 not that big of a difference keeping in mind how old one of the games is
Yea those weren t taken at the same time
just took them feel free to do the same thing
Then why are the battle net users different
B net 1 0 isn t compatible with 2 0 so the users aren t counted across b net versions Also all region users are counted so if you log on another region you ll see the same user numbers I hope sc2 will grow a bit in the following months
There s like 10x as many people playing sc2 as there is wc3 in the middle of the day I don t see how that is unexpected bad
There you go http imgur com SZCr91i for an ensemble
I understand that Blizzard likes the maps they ve made I m sure their map makers put a lot of effort into it but it s no surprise that we d want new ones Blizzard must know by now that the quality of maps produced by them isn t really up to snuff compared to the maps in GSL etc They ve gotten way better over time compare Ulrena to that god awful one they released when HotS came out but we still want to play the maps played by the pros
They should do something about people who quit games repeatedly to artificially lower their ranking so they can troll the lower leagues Perhaps getting timed out for 30 minutes or making sure the skill algorithm ignores every game under 30 seconds
Second half of the year What a goddamn joke Is the dev team working part time on SC2 or what
It was always going to be the second half of the year why are you surprised or did you just not watch Blizzcon or read any news
Jokers at least another 6 months before they do something about ladder gj guys
Fuck up again Just too slow
You know what s annoying The fact that they re trying to justify releasing an unfinished game How can you advertise features pre release then not actually finish implementing the features until a year after the game comes out That s honestly very poor planning and unprofessional on a company as reputable and established as Blizzard There s that phrase under promise and over deliver Not the other way around
Sounds like they re pulling off a BF4 on us
SC Reddit we want answers when is our ladder feedback Blizzard we are aiming to have it done by mid year SC Reddit AHHHHHHHH that s not the answer we want time to RIOT Tldr Blizz is doing a great job at communicating and if our community keeps acting like this everytime we get news we didn t want to hear they might just stop
I m gonna remain positive and hope these estimations are really rough and overestimations in general
I hope they will put the revamped ladder on PTR like in a month o two This kind of change requires good and intensive testing imho
I don t know how many people is working for SC2 and I ve never worked in game devloping company so I can t tell this is late or not All I can do is just wait If someone in r starcraft has great experience and ability please join Blizzard and finish ladder revamp skin new map faster
It boggles my mind that Blizzard thinks a map like Prion is even remotely balanced or interesting I just don t understand how they can take a look at that map and think it deserves a spot in the map pool for even one season let alone another one At least for the love of god change the gold bases to regular ones
Then it s just a shitty map with an obnoxiously difficult to hold third
why don t they just replace lerilak and central protocol with the gsl maps skyshield and rakshir FFS blizz sometimes i don t even
We need community co op maps to keep this mode alive
Well meme d Nate was trolling NoRegrets chat during a 10 person skype call the other night about Depot vrs Overlord Pylon build times

420 copypasta On my reddit BibleThump
Trolling This is a serious issue depots take 21 seconds vs the 18 or pylon or overlord This is an American tragedy s
what about eu
no one cares about your lack of central gov Go back to resolving crisis inefficiently while we build this wall
unban me plox
WE WILL BUILD A WALL AND MAKE THE ZERG PAY FOR IT
Mule drop their gold base
I loled
what about slightly decreasing bunker buildtime That would be a neat change
i think bunkers should just shoot down in those drop pod things like the mules then the drop pod transforms in to a bunker
This is amazing What if all terran buildings and units could be called down like mules maybe marines and mauraders take 8 seconds longer if they are not near a barracks s
You guys are basically describing the Space Marine building deployment from Dawn of War Example 3m05s for mobile
Every game can benefit from a little more 40k
Hes also describing warp ins
What is warp ins o
If this is a legit question When protoss upgrades his gateways to warpgates he can warp in units on to anywhere in the battlefield provided its close to a pylon If the pylon is near gateways nexus the warp in is 4 seconds faster
Or unsc in halo wars
ofcourse that s what terran need the Machine God fuck raynor and his blasphemous interspecies relationships only the God Emperor of makind can make terrain great again and burn all those filthy aliens to death
don t see why any unit other than lurkers should be able to attack a bunker if lings can take down a bunker you built it wrong

Well they never said Ladder was being revamped on LoTV launch When mentioned they always said later in 2016 Any notion otherwise is conceived solely in your mind rather then based in reality Sure be disappointed ladder revamp isn t coming sooner but don t say Blizz hoodwinked you
Agreed They arent pulling the wool over anyones eyes here even if the choice they made for timeframe is incorrect Which I agree with
Later in 2016 when the SC2 scene and player base is steadily declining into ded gaem status Good Job Blizz you managed to kill a beautiful franchise
How was it a bait and switch They said at blizzcon that it was coming but not for awhile Nowhere did they say that legacy was launching with a new ladder or that it was the first thing coming for it
Hey man I want stuff now and I don t care if it is hard or takes a long time to do or that it is a free feature that blizzard is making because they want to support their game So even thought I never actually play ladder this is the worst thing ever and David Kim is literally Hitler clone hellbent on torturing us
exactly
It s not unexpected for me Software development takes time they are simultaneously working on the nova campaign and skins voice packs and to be frank I would expect any meaningful ladder change planning building and testing to take a chunk of time Blizzard never told you guys it would be coming quickly but for some reason everybody took it that way
They even specifically said at blizzcon that ladder changes wasn t coming anytime soon
Just as a counter argument Prior to LotV launch one of the biggest fears going around was Blizz is just going to release LotV and then forget about it and the game will die We need microtransactions otherwise there s no incentive for blizzard to keep developing the game and everything will be stagnant within 6 months Here we are 2 months in and Blizzard is saying specifically we will be developing this game for at minimum 6 months and THEN we will start experimenting with paid extra content the Nova stuff at minimum This is a commitment that they will continue to improve on the game Yes I wish the ladder changes were out now too But every argument for why the ladder should have been updated at launch feed off of the hype etc is also an argument for why it will be good to have continued updates content later into development continued refreshed hype each time new content comes out longer lifespan of SC2
Good post They allayed all our fears of here s legacy and 3 balance patches now have fun for the next 10 years until sc3
This Upvote for you sir
The problem is their priorities are all out of whack
Do you have an internal list of their priorities that we can consult and what should their priorities be that they are ignoring
1v1 archon tournaments gimmicky campaign coop shit no one will care about in 3 months
Ah see that s the problem you think most people buy the game for 1v1 that s less than a quarter of the market since 2 million were playing the game a month prior to LotV release and less than 500k play 1v1 ladder
And how many people will be playing in 3 months that don t play 1v1 compared to those that do
Well in 3 months there will likely be another commander and map and Nova will only be 3 months after that so I imagine most casual fans will still be around Also remember that 2 million was pre LotV and most were playing non 1v1 so campaign arcade custom games etc those are people who stuck around since 2013 Why would you think those people would leave after 3 months if they stuck around for all these years but now there is more stuff to do
It s Blizzard s management of SC2 in a nutshell Too slow Just way way too slow This new ladder had to be there at launch Momentum windows of opportunity these are mystical concepts to Blizzard This is like opening 4 Gate only to move out at the 10 minute mark you aren t going to accomplish shit They have been like this since WoL beta all their improvements come so absurdly long overdue
So what you re saying is Blizzard is actually a bronze level protoss
That would make a whole lot of sense
No wonder they re going all in with LOTV
Too bad they forgot to bring the Korean region At least they have a bank to fall back on now
David Kim is a bronze level protoss yes
Thank you They are way too slow even when it comes to implementing beneficial and highly rational changes Things that would bring them insane amounts of and people they just won t put in until the hype is dead
Well what you are describing has actually been Blizzard since the beginning but comments like this show how long people have been around
since activision they have become much worse just look at wow for example where they according to them have the biggest team in history and yet come up with the least amount of content in history
It s arguably gotten worse over the last several years as technology s advanced and expectations have changed
This is an entirely inaccurate post
mind explaining how this is inaccurate
Blizzard does quality rather than quantity It s much better to wait 6 months for a ladder revamp than for them to launch with a new buggy ladder that needs constant tweaking and people complaining because it s bad They did this with the new UI They sent out a small change and everyone complained about the game being screwed and the UI was now garbage You can t blame them for wanting to just do 1 big change that people will like rather than smaller updates that will cause people to complain until they finish the update 6 months later You don t want fast content you want good content Blizzard isn t fast but that s because they focus on quality They always but out good changes in the end
It s one thing focusing on quality and another thing just being awfully slow A good example to sum Blizzard up is the leave league bug It is out for ages and fucked up the practice for many progamers and Blizzard just did nothing till now They not even disabled the button so nobody can abused it while they work on the problem they just let it happen for 3 MONTHS That doesn t have anything to do with quality and taking time it s just being slow It s almost seems like Blizzard doesn t have enough people working on this stuff
first off the leave league thing was only discovered a month ago Second it s not easy as log in fix log out You have to find the problem which could take a long time and then you have to make sure that when you fixed it nothing else in the code got screwed up Design is not as easy as you like to make it out to be They are not sitting around going Okay it s been a month Should we log in and fix that bug or wait They probably have been investigating it since the problem arose
The leave league might only started to be popular a month ago but i m pretty sure it was known longer And it s not that difficult there is obviously something wrong with the default mmr value people get when they leave the league or at least something it that direction And lets assume it might be not like that let s just assume it s really so hard to fix So you could at least disable the leave league button so people can t abuse it and fuck up the practice of pros They re either working on other stuff or i dunno some trainee working on the problem who doesn t know what he s doing
Anything earlier is meaningless The game launched in november You need time for the MMR s to settle and then there was christmas break which is about the time the issue became popular You re jumping to confusions based on nothing
Anything easier than what should be meaningless It has nothing do to with the MMR setteling it has something to do with the MMR when you leave league You re missing the point here You acuse me on jumping to conclusen based on nothing while you add nothing to back this statment up and not even adress the points which i make
Everything about SC2 and improving the multiplayer experience has been too little too late I m not surprised and neither should you be
My god they NEVER said it would be ready yet it was ALWAYS second half of the year there is no bait and switch when they say from the very beginning it would be ready later What fooled you I have no idea how this idea even exists literally NOTHING changed they are just reiterating old information
Would you rather it was done fast or done right
This sub was mad LotV might be delayed then upset when they launch maybe too early
No one was mad LoTV might be delayed People were mad when they indicated they were going to rush it out without making substantial changes in the beta
Yes they were for this same reason if it s delayed too much SC2 community and the hype will die Very few were worried it would be rushed until post release
Well somehow they managed to release it too late and to rush it out Pretty sweet c c c combo Wouldn t have been such a big need to release the thing quickly if HotS hadn t been in such a horrid state however
dude the game is already out this is straight forward stuff now
How does the fact the game has been released make it any more straight forward
Designing a ladder is straightforward Man you d think Valve Riot and Blizzard would have mastered ladder making but each one keeps fixing and tinkering with the ladders
EXACTLY it is in their game and they change or add one thing at a time and improve it over time based on what the players want not eh were gunna make what we want and you have to wait until we are allllll the way done with it
It s more the fact they didn t even try and experiment with a new ladder system and UI during beta yet promised changes were coming
The promised changes are still coming the idea they would be ready yet is a made up idea that is not based on reality Also the beta was too small to test a new ladder except at the very very end Beta is to test unit balance I can t think of a game that tested a new ladder at the same time testing new units but I d love an example since you think that is normal
They never said that it would be soon they said that they were working on it and said that it would happen everything else is you making it up
I didn t really come back for something as minor as a ladder revamp I care more about how fun the game is to play I think people are way too focused on metagamey stuff like unlocks and rank Lurkers cyclones disruptors that s the kind of stuff which excited me about LotV
The real bait and switch was the lie that Urun was going to be in the LotV campaign
OH MY GOD THE OUTRAGE PITCHFORKS OUT EVERYBODY
I ve been around since WoL release beta actually If there is anything I have learned since then is don t get your hopes up you will be let down
No For one Blizzard never gave a time table for the ladder revamp Secondly I don t live in a world unreasonable expectations Development takes time
could they stage it out a little bit you know give us the divisions in 2 months then race mmr in 4 6 Could we at least get some fucking new ladder maps
The state of the ladder and the maps are unrelated They aren t changing the maps because they like them the reason the ladder isn t changed yet is because it s not ready
They like the maps the very strong majority of 1v1 players do not
I like the maps Guess you can t say no one anymore
Fixed it for you
do you have a poll Or just a feeling If we have all the maps where everyone plays 3 base macro it s boring It s so much better to have maps that diversifies play This was a staple in broodwar This is the path that blizzard is going down and I know alot of pros who like the maps
I like the maps a lot actually it s the first season I have different strategies for each map
This rage you and others are displaying is based off two things 1 assumptions that content discussed at Blizzcon would be out at the start of 2016 2 A lack of understanding when it comes to software development Seemingly small changes take a lot of work to ensure availability and integrity aren t compromised let alone performing the programming itself Take a few minutes to look up scrums sprints and agile development Or if someone like u ebonwumon who has significant programming experience wants they can explain why these changes can t come quickly while also working ongoing support for the live client and developing Allied Commanders and Nova Seriously do you think they were sitting on their hands for the last X number of months Edit Keep downvoting It doesn t make me wrong
Got to love reddit sometimes Posts like that that are 100 accurate are downvoted because people would rather just cry because they didn t what they wanted when they wanted
That s completely beside the point Lycan The whole point is that this should be released when LotV is The game was released before its new features were That s it
Except the features they said would be in it are in it The campaign archon mode new multiplayer units co op etc That was all in it They also promised support into the future with things like the ladder revamp and skins This community has been begging for continuous support and updates and now that we are getting it we are complaining that major design changes are taking to long I mean comeon
People want fast rather than actually good content Which is never going to happen with blizzard
No it wasn t nowhere did they say that these were features that would come with legacy it was better to ship legacy and then add on Hots was getting pretty stale if they had waited another year to ship with all these features things would have just been bad
LOTV was practically a big patch The real content that shit that actually matters is gonna be out months later BlizzardLogic
The new units campaign balance changes re vamped UI new arcade co op missions mini campaigns were all just fake content The only thing that matters to all Starcraft players is the 1v1 ladder format seeing as the whole 25 of the playerbase which play Starcraft that play 1v1 are the only important part of the player base
I C WAT U DID THER But seriously when it comes to catering to the competitive scene of StarCraft 2 shit is too little and too late The slow implementation of changes and additions to the 1v1 experience is frustrating
Why should it have been released with LotV My god if LotV was feature bare you must have hated all other RTS expansion which don t launch with two new modes 6 new units and revamped UI Oh wait you don t play other RTS
Your post just made me realize that LotV an expansion pack has more content than Homeworld DoK a full release and is 10 more expensive
It has more content than any single Blizzard RTS it s a huge game the people saying it s not a complete game or shy on content either haven t played it or just want to hate on the game
It does make you wrong These features can be pushed out you re just making general project is late excuses Blizzard doesn t allocate resources for dev correctly and it doesn t exactly hire talented people given the corporate culture that s wrecked that place for the past decade and a half It s a cash cow milking factory Who the hell wants to pursue a career in Irvine if they have other options available to them that wont put them under that environment where kissing ass and being a general sycophant gets you everywhere and passion that goes against the grain is punished I know a couple of people that stuck with the culture long enough to get that executive status and they definitely weren t the passionate or even competent people There s a reason why other studios manage to get features and bugs delivered in a timely fashion while Blizzard is perpetually behind the times I mean if you re going to make generic excuses like that how do you explain how quickly they get stuff done during the active beta phases new features pushed out and iterated on active balancing vs how little get done post release It s their business model to do this
Wow you re really well connected maybe you should take your complaints straight to your Blizzard executive friends
So whats the reason for keeping the exact same map pool that pretty much everyone disliked
They explained their logic in the feedback
we want the players to continue playing on these maps because we don t think everything has been figured out and we think different playstyles can emerge so we won t change anything even if all of you are tired of playing on these same maps since the beta Is a paraphrase of what they said they don t care what the players want they just want to see more games on their diverse maps
You mean Dream Pool chosen by players or the last hated TL map contest chosen by players and pros
it s better than the same maps for 10 months in a row I d rather have a different set of 7 shitty maps then the same set of 7 shitty maps
Game hasn t been out 10 months
It was a bait and switch during beta when they reverted all the community s suggestions at the last second two weeks before release
what were some of the suggestions
The community put forth plenty of suggestions that were reverted or flat out ignored cyclone rework MSC removal nexus pylon cannon rework double damage while warping in removal of macro boosters DK insisted on keeping things the same the whole way through Refusal to rework fundamentally broken units like MSC and cyclone and refusing to test alternate economies and instead sticking with half patch the entire length of the beta
They did a great job during beta just taking too long with ladder update and micotransactions Can t wait until it happens tho Name one instance in beta that they didn t listen to the community on You can t name anything significant
There was a fantastic community derived economy model called double harvest that DK never publicly tested http www teamliquid net forum legacy of the void 482775 a treatise on the economy of scii DK rejected our proposition and his response showed that he didn t spend time with it or test it properly It was tested internally and the lack of community interaction led to these updates http us battle net sc2 en forum topic 17084519073 DK periodically asked us for what to improve upon We suggested the cyclone be reworked http www teamliquid net forum legacy of the void 496180 iaguz cyclones who needs em The cyclone was never addressed and thus we stagnate in a meta where mech is still not viable nor fun to play half a year after beta began The community wants the game to have lasting appeal but Blizzard fights us every step of the way by never addressing the flaws at the foundation of the game like MSC pylon cannon and cyclone We still can t see our MMR and we have these fake ladder points instead of a real rating system like ELO Blizzard needs to do better than this
Or as it turns out the community isn t always right especially about DH8 10 that was proven to not be better after the first few show matches He didn t reject it because of an arbitrary reason it just wasn t better so why change Also you are suggesting the meta is stagnated because of the Cyclone neither of which is true
Double harvest was superior for a multitude of reasons but never even received consideration for large scale testing because DK rejected it internally without proper comprehension of the benefits it had over half patch http www teamliquid net forum legacy of the void 483599 in response to david kim re sc2 economy I strongly urge you to read the discussion in this link DK rejected it based on misunderstanding and or flawed internal testing methods It s downright poisonous to the health of our game if the lead balance designer cannot even take a moment to acknowledge the tremendous effort the community put into DH In regards to the cyclone the unit does very little to make mech a viable composition in LOTV Many alternatives were suggested during beta specifically a ground based AA factory unit but we ended up with the cyclone and absolutely nobody going mech at the highest levels of play where it matters most
Double Harvest was just an unnecessary circlejerk Same as auto macro mechanics a bunch of idiots shouted about it and then said blizzard didn t listen He clearly tested it and saw that it stupid like everyone who saw it except for a few outliers Cyclone causing meta stagnation No just because factory can t build everything doesn t mean mech is weak Just because avilo and htomario whine about it doesn t mean its weak Don t want to see last year s cancer mech vs cancer sh
DH was not an unnecessary circle jerk It took a lot of time and effort on behalf of the community to test and develop the model which is why it is so disappointing that it was never tested in an extended beta which promised a large scale change testing philosophy
The problem with it is it was too similar to HotS I ve tried it I ve watched the showmatches and the proponents directly stated that they didn t want to deviate from the HotS model too much Blizzard wanted a bigger more obvious change Even Zeromus conceded to this
that s what the bait and switch was look how well we are listening to you guys come buy the game we are going to make this even better LOTV launches OK time to sit on are asses and not do anything
They aren t sitting on their asses unless you have some info we don t They are balancing the game redesigning the ladder creating skins creating another campaign adding commanders and missions to Allied Commanders and improving the tournament system What have they promised that isn t being worked on
I d rather them do one finish it quicker and give us something new then move on to the next rather than we are working on all of these things and you will get them sometime with balance changes in between as needed
I can t stress how ladder eevamp was important for a lot of people I can t blame people for simply bailing out on SC2 after discovering they will wait for it at least half year more
At least give us new maps for season 2
you all realize how long it can take to code and more importantly debug complex pieces of software
I m just gonna play guitar hero untill this situation is fixed
That same maps for this season is definitely a downer And then at the same turn they get mad offended at us for saying they have a small dev team Well what do you expect people to think when it takes you ages to get anything done
oh common you cant be serious they said that it will be done in 2016 if I remember they said later in 2016 and they are blizzard they take their time with everything or did you just woke up from coma also I think that they are working now on things that bring them money from starcraft and that are single player nova missions and if you started to play lotv only because of ladder changes then you are doing it wrong you should play it because of the game itself its gameplay competition other thingsare secondary not important but if you feel it other way than you probably dont enjoy this game and should focus on something else
Does anyone have the source where Blizzard said it would be coming in season 1 of 2016 I could ve sworn they said it Their big announcements with no follow up is really depressing
Pretty sure that was speculation based on the timing of the season 1 rollout
Yeah it looks like I was just remembering Lycan s speculation https www reddit com r starcraft comments 3s0ld8 ladder changes 3 cwsybsh context 3
No they specifically said they were aiming for it to be in the first season of 2016
Interesting I don t remember that It does make sense that they d say something like aiming so if they couldn t hit their target they weren t promising or announcing but instead being transparent about their goals
link it then edit Doesn t say here http us battle net sc2 en blog 19955452 starcraft ii competitive multiplayer panel recap 07 11 2015
It was said on one of the blizzcon panels
With no definite source there s no proof for them specifically saying anything This whole comment thread has gotten me so salty And if they briefly said it during the panel I m sorry but that seems like something very small to base this off of as I can t find it anywhere else
deleted
I was there they said it out loud
Find it yourself it s not my job to find it for you
If you are going to say someone said something either prove it or you are a liar The scientific process isn t 1 Come up with an idea 2 Say that idea is fact 3 If called out say prove me wrong
I don t feel that way as they aren t exactly needed THAT badly I do like the idea of them though I care more about the game being in a balanced state So as a protoss player I m worried about the nerfs we are getting today especially when we see terrans actually learning how to defend against the adept to the point they come out ahead if we even attempt it
The whole release was clearly rushed They were well into tweaking and polishing the macro mechanics removal and all of a sudden were like Whoops we don t actually have time let s just keep it this way and push it out It s pretty clear that Blizzard has other priorities now
Yeah lader revamp was the number 1 thing i was looking forward to I m a Zerg and I d accept Ravagers needing a Ravager Den Parasitic Bomb having the 60 damage and even requiring a 200 200 research required I d accept Prion to lose the 3rd as a gold base I d accept Ultras going down to 7 armor I d accept Brood Lords losing a range I d accept any reasonable nerf as long as I 1 Get the ladder revamp and 2 Get a new map pool Seriously balance is one thing but I honestly think I d have fun playing any of the 3 races even nerfed into the ground on new maps with new ladder system than play this ladder pool again Sure the game isn t perfectly balanced and that needs to be addressed but a new map pool and ladder system is far easier to implement and requires way less time New map pool could take idk a day New ladder system is just splitting leagues into bigger portions it s still using hidden mmr it s just less hidden now as you can move up within a league and see how close you are to the next league kind of
Seriously what the fuck Blizzard Everything they promised is coming soon and has no date Skins not the Nova skin fuck off with that argument voice packs ladder revamp and more With Legacy of the Void we are doing Hey Blizzard thanks for mentioning that it would all come at least six months after the game fucking released
They said these features were not coming anytime soon They made that very clear Anyone assuming the first part of 2016 were always going to be disappointing
Actually all those things you mentioned Blizzard said second half of the year only reason to be surprised is if you ve ignored Blizzard s posts for 6 months
They said first quarter of the year now it s second half Wow lmao
Source
The year is 2020 Ladder revamp is nearly complete guys the technology is now in its final form Blizzard
Between this and the ladder revamp I don t think I ll be playing Sc2 again This season I hit Rank 1 Diamond I would probably never hit master I got bored of playing with my rank standing still Quite simply I probably won t hit master Because my hands are slow I feel my game knowledge is good my build orders good and everything is good compared to my average opponent Then at the end of a game of even rating Their apm is generally miles ahead of mine My APM at my best with the new apm system was 170 as Terran I m fine with having not great multitasking I enjoy the game as I do However sitting at rank 1 of a league going nowhere is boring I m fine with being diamond I m fine with jobbing to masters I m fine with getting dicked on by Nydus or Adept all in I m not fine with no feedback from the game of me doing better or worse
Hey man just wanted to say Rank 1 diamond is no easy Feat You have plenty of masters players with APMs that are 170
This Heck mech was designed for slow players to beat better zergs
This is such a pity post Seriously You re complaining about being rank 1 in diamond Spoiler you re doing exactly what you need to be doing to stay in Diamond if you re not getting promoted Why do you need some arbitrary MMR system to tell you that you re getting better AND the system will tell you if your MMR is increasing which honestly only reflects long term overall skill and doesn t show that you can beat or lose to a player in any given game who is better or worse than you if you get promoted Let me explain this again If your MMR gets better and you re rank 1 diamond since you obviously have alot of points and a good w l record it means you re on the cusp If you play better you get promoted The system isn t totally transparent like you want but it does give you a way to know if you re getting better It sounds like you re staying the exact same which you didn t account for I really don t like when people give a game ultimatums Don t enjoy it Fine Then leave Come back in 4 months when the new ladder is implemented and stop your whining because gasps they said it will be Have some damn patience

I as well as many other in KR community expected LotV to be a lot smaller than HotS I mean yeah the expansion is different and it s pretty cool but it s just HotS 2 0 Blizzard made it sound like they were going to do some amazing changes and redesign of the game but at the end of the day the only thing that changed was the mineral worker change Nothing really core changed in the game and that disappointed so many people I m still kinda salty that Blizz released LotV so early without much design changes
If it s just HotS 2 0 does that mean there were some vast design changes between WoL and HotS Or can we just call it WoL 3 0
a lot of complaints on korean community was really design of sc2 units and a lot of them expected at least some turnaround in lotv beta Blizzard didnt really change anything design wise after all other than eco
Eco was not changed pacing was changed Very important note
eco was changed in way that you can t sustain 3 base eco on 3 base half as much time as in hots The half mineral patch actually make it really different doesn t it That counts as eco surely
Yea I guess the only real change was pacing though I really dislike new unit design philosophy myself More flashy micro with questionable results on gameplay itself
Economy changes changed the pacing So you could call it either The economy was definitely changed don t know how you can t see that You re talking like having half min patches doesn t affect in game economy of course it does In addition a lot of macro mechanics were changed Mules for example mine less iirc
He s just using econ as a synonym for income which is incorrect Econ income
Even if he has which he hasn t he s not wrong in that it was a change to the economy e Unless you mean u Avexyli then I agree
No I m not I m making a clear distinction between what actually happened You manage your economy differently but the economy itself has not changed You still make 5 mineral per blue 7 per gold 4 per gas in returns Your income is the same most of your units still cost the same amount of resources your workers still pair up and devalue themselves compared to the prequel game The economy is still weak to harassment units The only thing that was changed in Legacy of the Void is how quickly you get your income and that it s more difficult to manage due to pacing changes Nothing else has changed When you saturate three bases you still get the same 3 base economy as you always have which has been a common criticism and was ignored by Blizzard during the beta from internal testing If we were playing HotS and the meta shifted in an aggressive direction that meant you couldn t macro in most games would we call it an economic change No we call it a meta change
Do you have any link to the community forums in korea
Just stick around in play xp or dcinside Plenty of garbage whine posts just like us though I just browse from time to time just to see differing opinions
I think econ and worker change is a core change
That s why I didn t buy it Nothing fundamentally changed
thats because the big changes they proposed got shot down by the top tier shitposters lets get rid of mule drops and focus on the fun aspects of starcraft we can get rid of mule drops the essenence of all that is starcraft is just muledrops ive spent years perfecting my muledrop timing without muledrops ill just lose all my games
Yes because two months out from release is a wonderful time to start testing such stellar features as auto inject They even trialled auto build units internally It would have been a cluster fuck
like i said all their new ideas got shot down Anything that wasnt the essence of starcraft2 from the release gets shot down from the hardcore blizzard forum posters The introduction of larva mules idea came from these forum posters its mainly just those hardcore posters that the game is designed for Thus the fanbase of the game is mainly just a small dedicated group of people rather than a large but more casual group of people if you want a game that appeals to a large group of people you gotta try and get feedback from that large group of people not just the diehard fans
That period of removal of mule drop and other cluster fuck was retarded because game as whole was designed around eco mechanics They would have had to modify how much all terran units cost and their effectiveness if they did due to scv differences orbital ect It was plain unplayable for terran and also blizzard wouldn t want to do so much just to shake up
I expected a big shake up That s what the other comment said Blizz said they ll change shit and didn t do anything significant with regards to units
That s what a lot of people expected going into beta Instead we got half baked see we tried half hearted macro mechanic change with no attempt to balance it just to prove a point with questionable designed unit additions to make game more flashy
i agree major balance changes would have been required but if they figured it out the game wouldhave become more approachable Its the reason i didnt buy the game on wol or hots but i bought it for lotv and play as protoss I dont care to become an expert in mindless repetition of anything I like the dynamic aspects of the game the idea of first having to learn lots of mindless repetition before being able to play the fun parts of the game turns me off and I m sure it turns off others even more
I believe that they sold a lot of copies and a lot of people played the campaign The problem with the 1v1 game is that the fundamental proposition hasn t changed it s still ridiculously difficult for new players to learn
Yep They just horribly destroyed the multiplayer Let the clock tick and the game die with every balance and design issue unanswered
they could have put in filtersc style tutorial to alleviate the problem or make it easier to access The current tutorial teaches 0 Its not even close to helpful or accessible when you need to search guides by yourself on youtube instead of easily accessible ingame official client
a tutorial might help but again long term it changes nothing a 1v1 pure rts is simply unpalatable to many people they can respect the game as the pinnacle of competitive gaming like people can respect chess or go but that doesnt mean their gonna sit down on a saturday night and watch chess instead of football out of respect
Blizzard actually reached out to me and asked if I was planning on doing content for LoTV They also offered to feature some of my content on battle net and the sc2 launcher The problem for me was this happened after I d already retired and I didn t have enough faith in the game doing well enough for me to sustain myself youtube ad revenue sucks When Starcraft 2 is at it s absolute best it s an amazingly fun game to play and improve at LoTV still has it s moments but it s extremely predictable and those moments are pretty few and far between When I opened twitch to watch the LCK I see to no giant surprise a Terran opening mass reaper on Prion Terrance The magic of Starcraft 2 for me has always really come down to two things The ability to play my style of game and measure my improvement nearly every game AND the ability to turn bad situations into good ones with my own skill Skill can be defined as out microing macroing from really far behind or just out multitasking my opponent Legacy of the Void really feels like it s eroded all of that stuff if I don t have the right units to deal with something I just lose now This leads to a lot of frustration because when you do lose that way you already know the answer eg I needed to get ghosts started earlier so there really is no feeling of growth from those games where as in the past you could look at the game and see where your micro could have improved etc The games shifted massively from Wings where pre blord infestor era the game came almost entirely down to your raw skill and games where you lost almost purely because you lacked a key piece of tech didn t really ever happen there was always something to work on to get better at and always room for a miracle comeback or defeat via you or your opponents skill Now I already know who s going to win the games I watch well in advance of the final engagement and in the games I play Those just aren t Starcraft anymore
That largely echos the complaints of a lot of people along with general direction the game is taking on unit design and way things are balanced The ghosts skillshot shade cyclone ect are flashy micro types in my eyes that doesn t really fit starcraft as well as specific counter like ultralisk ect But it s a shame to lose someone like you in community since your guide was top notch and helped me realize how to practice my mechanics Thank you for your guides and I wish you did make one for lotv when people were asking me about how to improve in hots I would always point to your guide as it provided excellent srep by step way to improve mechanics
I ve played watch league for ages I use to play watch both games so it s not really switching I don t play league very seriously though I m garbage at it so I just play ranked for fun The GSL s usually on the main twitch splash page and that s where it was when I was going to watch the lck
I think the scope of what can be considered skill needs to be expanded when considering LotV and or RTS in general There s a lot of skill that goes into scouting map awareness and decision making and honestly WoL and HotS left something lacking it that regard LotV has improved this somewhat and made recon a more necessary skillset to have There s also a lot of frustration when a opponent can just build something whatever they want that has no counter that a player can build To your point about Ghosts if you knew the answer and knew you needed Ghosts earlier there s your point of growth that you can feel from these games Now I have learned I need to scout sooner and better You can look at replays and see where micro can be improved macro improved as well as scouting and recon which is also raw skill I understand the dismay you describe but if watching SC that outcomes are seemingly known already the dismay should be leveled at the player for not building map awareness and reacting appropriately not at the game
I play both sc2 and lol I ve found it much easier to get my friends into lol Sc2 is just too unforgiving to appeal to casual players people don t like losing a game because they made one mistake
Very rarely do I lose an SC2 game because I made one mistake People don t like having to blame themselves for losing a game In League even if you go like 2 8 as the AP carry you can always blame your jungler for not rotating enough your mid for not doing well enough or your support for not supporting enough even if none of those things are true you can still blame them for it In SC the only things you can blame are yourself your race or bullshit cheese what a fucking retard he can t do anything but cheese play a real game fucking cheeser It s really hard to get into the mindset that you suck and the loss was your fault I think this is what drives people away from 1v1 games and into more team based games
Guess starcraft reminds to much of real life then huh
The wounds were deep after hots and there is no quickfix But changes has been made and the game is so much better What will happen we don t know But rolling over and play dead is for the weak
Koreans disagree heavily They ve gone from calling David Kim names and teasing Blizzard to making a dedicated whining forum on PlayXP as well as a redirect to Brood War forums
not only the koreans i disagree heavily too the koreans are experts in that regard and you cant just dismiss their oppinions the starcraft subreddit is the only gaming subreddit i have yet visited that constantly blames other stuff than the game itself for its lack of success while bullying oldschool broodwar players speaking up about bw being superior instead of accepting that there are reasons behind the downfall of the game in regard of bad game design and that those nagging oldschool broodwar nerds might have a point sc2 perfect hurr durr cant those bw idiots shut the fuck up WHY IS MY GAME DYING ITS PERFECT dota 2 just copied dota while fine tuning several aspects they didnt make a new game they tried to stay as close to the original concepts as possible is it a coincidence dota 2 is succesful i dont think so csgo did the same if you think sc2 is more exciting and better than broodwar you are part of the problem if you think the negativity in the community has no reasons and no frustrations about bad game design behind it you are part of the problem if you think skins and stuff like that would solve any problems you are part of the problem if you think mobas are dominating and RTS arent just popular enough you are part of the problem that are excuses and no reasons because if a game is fun to play and well designed PEOPLE WILL FUCKIN PLAY IT with or without skins with or without peoples negativity with or without blizzard communicating with or without good or bad casters no matter what genre the game is all that stuff doesnt matter if the game would be awesome but the community doesnt accept that there are fundamentally things wrong with starcraft 2 that is the one and only real problem with starcraft but sc2 fans wont accept it because they like it the way it is problem is only a minority does you will always find a minority that will like something and you can keep arguing and looking for reasons elsewhere the reason is the game itself blizzard constantly ignores fundamental RTS design concepts that are easily fixable easy doesnt mean it wouldnt be a ton of work it just means its not really complicated if you understand how rts works and to the people that say make it better you retarded fucker i wont start listing all the problems sc2 has we had that plenty of times pm me blizzard i ll make you a f2p starcraft version that can be monetized is up to date in regard of gamedesign not backwards like starbow more fun to play more exciting to watch less stressful for the player with options for new players to get in that would work better as esport than the current version and it would implement true next gen RTS elements i have a complete concept ready and can do all the balancing and if you ask why i dont make a mod if you are good at something never do it for free im currently involved in other projects that will earn me money i can write all this shit since this will get burried in the huge wide web anyway and thats a good thing just ignore me cuz im obviously just some random crazy person talking gibberish ranting on the internet with no idea what he is talkin about and no proof for his words have fun with sc2 im off watching some bisu vs hiya bw games you guys just never understood we bw fanboys love the game as much as you do we only start ranting and hating because of our deep love for starcraft because only when you care about something and love something it can make you angry we always just wanted it to be better a shrinking and dying proleague hurts a lot
you ll get downvoted for this post but you re right about broodwar vs sc2 I doubt that you re capable of the level of game design balance that you say that you are but I agree with your criticism of SC2 and the attitude of it s community Long live Broodwar
And the game didnt really take off till skins got introduced even to the point that people would rather trade gun skins all day than play the actual game
yeah as much as you hate micro transactions it does keep a game alive
Dota to Dota 2 isn t a good comparison from BW to SC2 Dota 2 isn t really Dota 2 it s Dota 1 with better graphics and a better interface on a better engine It s not a new game There are no heroes in Dota 2 that aren t in Dota and there are still heroes in dota that aren t in dota 2 It wasn t until fairly recently last year or so that icefrog broke parity between Dota and Dota 2 SC2 is a new game compared to SC1 Dota 2 is not a new game compared to dota 1 Similar to CS GO vs CS 1 6 Also CS GO was complete and utter shit until Valve rushed in for damage control because their name was attached and it wasn t even popular until you could make a profit by trading hats I mean skins
TBH I would have liked a BW2 Making sc2 different just because isn t too great
SC2 in esports scene is brood war all over again except that Korea barely gives a shit
ROFL why would you expect that Don t you see the decline and other trends It was obvious lotv was a fail when stream numbers did not boost like they did when hots came out
Honestly it just gets proven more and more as time passes that region locking was the right move and im not being ironic Its sad but the Korean scene has been in decline for a really long time now and recovery seems impossible Its better to cut off whatever ties and focus on growing the foreign scenes
You could as easily make the other case that the foreign scene has declined much more The Korean scene is comparatively much bigger and still has several major stable sponsors
New foreign players come up all the time New Korean players are a rarity Compare the foreign scene in 2012 and now then compare the Korean scene then and now Korea has declined more
Tbh SC2 in the west is smaller than Smash CoD SC2 as a esport is competing vs SMITE
I recommend cutting off the hopeless foreign scene and focusing on the one region with any semblance of sustainability
Its not a good idea because fuck Korea its good because we can t survive off Koreans alone This doesn t justify it either this is just unfortunate
I watch way way less Mostly due to lack of quality content from proper tournaments So far ive only been watching GSL on VODS But i also watch less because i have to relearn all the stuff now and im not even playing lotv I don t even own it They fucked up the immortal if it was like it used to be prism immortals would have kicked ass In addition adepts are lame They take away allot of the positioning And do they even have guns do they throw a light bulb or some shit If so do they are not even trowing it hard it just floats over the the marine and melts it I could go on about ravager cyclone and libs
I ll be honest I have not played a single 1v1 since LOTV beta The game suddenly got boring to me I do not want to learn new units new stupid strats that require insane control even more apm than in hots I played campaign sometimes play coop missions Now mind you this it comes from a guy who played since 2010 I do not enjoy tournaments either The only sc2 content I watch is Lowko s but thats more because of him not because of the game itself I mean the guy is funny The game got boring to me suddenly Maybe I will get back to it later but for now it is just not fun
WCS changes are good You can t expect ppl to take endless bullying from Blizzard and just be fine about it WCS changes affected Korean scene so much
OP you are mistaken Kaelaris reassured us that the Korean scene would not suffer
Didn t they also limit rosters to 8 players
Well there is one less team
I am the point that i dont want to come to reddit any more just because of depressing shit that is getting posted Oh and stop playing SC2 while i am at it
lol k If you actually cared about the game you would just not complain and just play the game
Downsizing is healthy
Stop it
removed
He s quoting hotbid why are you crediting the redditor
My mistake
The thing is a bunch of personalities have their head in the sand
Thank you
No edgelord making jokes which are damaging to the outside view and overall perception of the state of starcraft
Game isnt dying cause people are being edgy by pointing out the truth
Do you actually believe sc2 esports scene size is influenced at all in any way by random 1 liners on reddit If so you are incredibly naive delusional and almost crazy Just cause you post positive comments that doesnt help the scene
When every single thread or talk of sc2 has several replies or chat messages about how the game is dead it gets picked up on Sponsors pick up on it less money less tournaments I wholeheartedly agree that random one liners which aren t random they are found in every single thread regarding anything remotely negative to the game are damaging Let s put it this way do you think they benefit the scene I don t and at the very least that means it s not positive for sc
They dont influence the scene at all Most esports viewers dont visit the sub and wont decide will they watch the game from comments Sponsors dont browse downvoted comments and decide based on how many people say some shittier foreign sc2 is amazing and casters smile like they casting WoL gsl finals but they have less viewers than Destiny streaming himself going to starbucks on hitbox tv Also people post this to bait people like yourself into responding come on guys being mean ruins viewership somehow cause its kinda funny seeing people drinking the day9 incontrol koolaid that dowsizing is healthy
Stuff like this http oddshot tv shot dreamhackcs 20160124114020714 wouldn t happen if this trolling wasn t rampant
I am sure this clip ruined sponsorship deals and tanked atleast 10k viewers Not the fact that the system in place rewards lesser players for being born in certain countries the game is just not good enough meta was stale for long periods of time with balance and incompetent organisers ran tournaments with hundreds of thousands of viewers but still ran at a loss or Blizzard not supporting the Esports aspect for years and marketing their game as a singleplayer product where more than half of the players never played a match online Or the huge pricetag on the game with no basic social features Those things are irrelevant right The game was destroyed by trolls and toxicity right
Can you guys link me to some of the roster downsizing stuff they are talking about in the comments
why was this downvoted
I think most of these issues with less content in forms of tournaments and less players being signed is partially because everythings so new that people are unsure about investing teams dont want to sign players that havent proven themselves in this expansion investors want to wait until they can see stream numbers and such before making big investements the longer lotv is out the more investment should come since it will be a more stable stability is better than being unsure

Pointing out a statistic isn t exactly a circlejerk No one said you can t enjoy SC2 just because it s dying
It s funny really he s accusing the subreddit of being a circlejerk while he s actively participating in the circlejerk that you re not allowed to say or do anything which may show the decline of sc2
deleted
The scene is dying How can we not talk about this The writing was on the wall even back in 2012 and yet fanboys keep saying be positive it will all be alright But its not going to be all right Starcraft will die at this rate How can you not complain when the game you love is dying
I think the only thing dying is your common sense you need to chill The StarCraft scene is still alive and for quite some time
So alive
statistics mamschistics downsizing is healthy for our game I d just like to throw in a note of calm here It s no secret that the sc2 scene was unsustainable and always was This restructuring was in inevitable after kespa joined in It s not very pleasant but its a positive change to keep sc2 going in a manageable form And keep in mind also that many of these retirements from kespa guys would be happening anyway at their age within military service coming up and so forth The only thing that can actually kill off the game as an esport is negativity from the community leading to further depressed interest so lets not do that alright Lets see what we have on the other side of this time of change accept it and enjoy what the future brings
It s easy to bash people now for being edgelords but back when issues surrounding the game and the esport needed to be discussed a lot of fans and community leaders simply denied there being any faults at all Negativity in this community has been used as a misnomer for criticism Sure negativity for the sake of it is bad but this statistic is relevant so fuck off trying to deny reality
They force a roster lock and suddenly sc2 is dying You people realize they made the teams downsize to just 8 per team correct
There is also one less team Your point
There were 8 teams there are now 7 Assuming equal size teams and assuming the other teams did not want to pick up any of the players from the 8th team so the entire 8th team is a complete loss that s only an expected 12 5 loss of players So more than twice as many players as you would expect from losing one team are gone That s the point
It also looks like the roster sizes for PL were limited so those teams have players they just didn t couldn t list on the rosters whereas that wasn t the case last year I wonder why they limited PL rosters
That one less team only had 3 players at the end Not counting the 4 Chinese players that never played Two of which were banned Good thing creator myungsik and keen are on good teams now
I believe there is still the same prize pool If that s the case it might actually be good for the scene I think it s better to have fewer pros who are able to earn a living then have many struggling to get by
Proleague has never been about the prize pool It s supported by sponsors and salaries
OP please remove this post It is inaccurate as we already know from Kaelaris and Apollo that the Korean scene will not be declining
Top kek
lmfao brew
Who needs proleague when we have local heroes
Noone Because we root for our local heroes we cannot also enjoy watching Koreans Those two are mutually exclusive
I don t think the type of fan who is upset about proleague losing 35 of games typically enjoys watching Elfi vs Demuslim
For sure I never watch any foreign tournaments Only Korean leagues The quality of play is so different
Listen here mate if you weren t being influenced by the casters you couldn t tell the difference between Proleague and two diamond players
Never understood that argument It might be true for low level players though who knows But it is impossible not to see the huge skill gap immediately especially watching someone like demuslim play
I can t decide what s more annoying about your post the smugness or the blatant inaccuracy
it s a joke
You do realize that Blizzard has no control over what KESPA does whatsoever right This sub is so retarded sometimes
Hypothetically Kespa might have less Korean players as such less teams and less games because a sizeable amount of them padded their Kespa earnings with earnings in international tournaments and leagues With that gone the money that Kespa pays might not be enough to sustain a professional gaming career The fact that Koreans won t appear overseas anymore might also influence the money that international sponsors like Samsung provide leading to Kespa being unable to hire more players or execute longer events with more games There might be other stuff playing into all of this which none of us know about etc I m not saying the above is actually the case I m just saying it s pretty easy to see that it could be Saying that Blizzards WCS system has no influence on proleague and Kespa is just short sighted
Who was blaming Blizzard
He was by referencing local heroes
It s pretty obvious that he was making a joke about Blizzard s new WCS system
Yeah what a funny unexpected joke that totally hasn t been posted a million ti ZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzz
I didn t say it was funny just answering the guy s question
inb4 the WCS defense force starts shitting on Stuchiu again
Man I hope he can avoid those people would be awkward to have people pulling down their pants and being shit on
Well you have to remember that last proleague season started at the end of december This year it will start in february I can see WHY they have one round less
They could have easily postpone the ending date for this PL in order to have more rounds
The last season was till mid october Then there is blizzcon and other stuff as well they could have easily is kinda an assumption no
Inb4 people blame Blizzard for this
And rightly so
How is KeSPA s decision a Blizzard issue How is Prime matchfixing Blizzard s fault How is KeSPA limiting rosters to 8 players Blizzard s fault Please enlighten me
KT Rolster has 10 players
In proleague rosters everyone has 8 players or fewer https gyazo com fa2f9a97046f1886726d5ec70710cbf5
I stand corrected That seems needlessly arbitrary Poor CJ Entus too
Jin Air also has 6 players and you ve got a Jin Air flair Wut
sOs is my favourite player I hadn t checked out the actually team in a long time This is what I get for just glancing at something and opening my mouth
I don t get it what do you get A reply
Of course they will this is r starcraft after all
Sad but understandable from company perspective
i love SC2 so much this makes me sad what can we do to make SC2 popular again
Korean sc2 is in dire times right now and life being arrested for match fixing makes it even worse
was it confirmed that it was for match fixing
The arrest was made by the regional police station that investigated match fixing
bum bum bummm
EDIT Why are people taking this so seriously Damn lol Thanks for the region lock Blizzard Combine that with ladder bugs laughably large matchmaking windows map hackers poor maps and inability to read a calendar and you ve done everything to fucking ruin your game D Blizzard Guys Korea is our biggest market and they re moving to other games and the only game of ours they re playing is Brood War but it s on a private server so we don t make money WHAT DO WE DO Guy in the corner Let s lock them because they re Korean Blizzard You re a fucking genius
lol this is nothing to do with Blizzard Even if no region lock situation is exact same This decision is made by KeSPA and Matchfixer YoDa B4
The region lock is why people like Flash retired They don t think it s fair to contain a country because they re better than everybody else
Flash retired because of region lock WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT Read his interview 100 times Rain Fantasy s retirement may something to do with new WCS but they can t participate proleague
Rain had to give up a kidney or something and I m pretty sure he was advised against stressful activities
It s pretty known in the Korean scene He s not the only one and I m not shitting on SC2 I m shitting on Blizzard SC2 has so much potential and they fucking step on their own toes making stupid decisions
Flash went to how many foreign sc2 events least year 1 1 event He went to 8 foreign events in 3 years Foreign sc2 can t have been a factor for him Hell there were rumors of him retiring in 2014 ffs If it was because of the region lock he d have said so They d all have said so It s common knowledge is a shitty argument because it goes against numerous facts Region locking is necessary or the game will die The game needs a foreign scene because Koreans don t like it Mainly because it s not a game that can be PC Bang ified easily but also because it s not Brood War and is different
It doesn t mean he didn t retire because of it How would you feel if you were a professional Korean and this happened to you One day you just wake up and even though you don t participate in anything foreign you hear you re barred from anything non Korean Your tournaments are downsized and have top heavy prize pools as compensation half of Blizzcon is reserved for non Koreans etc Wow Korea can only have 8 Blizzcon spots because we re so good nobody else could get in What a load of shit I m done That s pretty much what s happened with a lot of these people Even if you ll get in anyway or only dream of getting in it s extremely unfair and very offensive
Why didn t he say it Why didn t any of the retirees say it The Blizzcon thing is bad but having region locked weekend tournaments is better than not having them at all how can you not see that
Because you don t say you re retiring because you don t like Blizzard The only Koreans I can think of that retired from any esport and openly bitched about the company or people up top are some really young LoL players When you re as old as a lot of these players you just drop it and move on Knowing Blizzard saying they fucked up will only hurt the game more
Then join Blizzard and do what you want Please save SC2
I tried about six months ago I haven t heard anything from them so I assume they threw my resume in the trash lol I m pretty young though I don t have much experience under my belt so that s understandable
ya at least Blizzard did well in this case lol
Flash didn t retire because of the reason lock Flash rarely attended any tournaments outside Korea so it would not affect him in the slightest Stop making up things None of this is accurate
I don t think its Blizzard s fault tbh It s probably the western tournament organizers who made the region lock happen and the korean organizers who are giving up on sc2 because its so small
There is so much wrong with this post good lord
EHRMERGERD GUISE DAED IZ DA GEAM
Thanks to idiots like you this game is downsizing gtfo
the game isn t dying because of people saying its dying
it certainly doesn t help when people might be interested but they hear it s dead
This year will have 56 as many games of korean sc2 compared to last year Imagine how much it will decrease next year
if you want to spam dead game just spam it if this will make you feel better
If people listened to us before half of the fanbase moved on before HotS even came out maybe Blizzard could have made the changes necessary to keep the game alive
Rules tldr get the fuck out with your doodads
Funnily enough most of my conversations with Blizz revolving around maps is how much of a pain in the ass it is for them to accept community maps since half their process of becoming ladder ready is literally removing hundreds of unnecessary doodads that cause maps to lag like shit Case in point Metropolis LE had to be taken off to remove stuff due to super low FPS since they didn t remove enough stuff Most mapmakers understandably want to have beautiful creations but building a map that works well on an i7 980ti setup isn t gonna give you an idea of what someone on the minimum requirements will experience
Metropolis was lagging because the smoke LOS blockers caused massive frame drops That s not a doodad overload issue that s doodads being fundamentally broken regardless of context
theres quite a lot of problem around this heres a few of them maps are very much judged on looks even if its mostly subconcious this pushes mappers to make maps as beautifull as possible in the hope of winning but at the same time have to wory about not bumping their heads against the wall that is lagg there are cases where maps can run completely fine on 1PC but break down on the next it isn t very clear to mappers exactly what causes these issues so they can t avoid it intentionally
Which is why the post gives some suggestions on what not to include in the maps to try and keep them as lag free as possible
the problem with that is that they don t seem to care about that however as they have hosted maps on ladder that hit every checkmark on that list without much difficulty which is extremely confusing to me and possibly other mappers as well
I m sure it s a learning process Blizzard released maps with things like this in them realized they weren t great for performance for some people now they know to not include them in the maps etc
And that s why they re in the rules So that mapmakers don t have to undergo the same learning process
Yes exactly this I ll see two extremely similar maps but one has 2000 more doodads and a nifty texturing theme and people are shitting themselves over that one and barely caring about the other I think some of us try to judge just by layout but so many let aesthetics cloud their judgment unfortunately
I don t know how the mapmaker works but if the doodads are all grouped into the same category is there a way blizzard could for example say max 15 objects from this list on the map That way with a quantitive restriction mapmakers maybe would realize what kind of limits we re talking about in performance
Different doodads will cause different performance issues They re not all exactly the same
Ah I see Could there be a way to rank the performance of different doodads for example split them into a category of high performance and low performance doodads
Even that s difficult Some hardware performs differently depending on the doodad As u Meavis said reflection lighting transparency or complicated shadows are all dangerous to use in bulk Things that do this should be used tastefully
doodads that feature reflection transparancy and give off lighting or have huge complicated shadows are the ones that stand out most when it comes to performance issues AFAIK the glacier set hits all of those but lighting which is likely why they re banned there are no issues with them that I know off however and have been used many times before in ladder maps
there are no groupings and most maps are in the range of 1000 3000 doodads
It takes like 10 seconds to remove all doodads on a map
If this is for next ladder season I feel it s weirdly close but I m so happy either way For the love of all that is good please get rid of lerilak and central protocol I imagine blizz won t get rid of ruins but at least central protocol
It s for Season 2 Sorry for the confusion We corrected the blog details
Current map pool for 2016 Season 1 would suck
WOOHOO
Nathan I suggest you to read the blog they are not looking for standard maps they are looking for things as nonstandard as they can get their hands on and this time we don t have the TLStrat team so they can put their inputs into keeping a more or less balanced map pool Oh also no dates so we don t know what timeframe or season they are targeting
I did read the blog those maps are not creative at all they re just bad I do not think Prion or Ulrena are that bad except for the double gold 3rd 4th on prion for Z
True but everytime a community member made a godlike map Blizzard altered it drastically Like daybreak for example they changed all the minerals to standard The map design was to have small conflicts in the center with just a few resources Blizzard ruined the map by making it a full base
daybreak was a close to perfect map

Prion would probably be great if that natural and third was gold bases rather than third and fourth
Double gold for zerg is BAD ENOUGH to claim this map as BAD
I figured that those were the maps they were looking to replace if they re looking to retain the same balance of standard unique maps
There is nothing creative about central protocol That map is as good as dead I don t even mind ulrena
You mean you dont mind ghost peppers
If you don t consider backdoor rocks the pinnacle of creativity I don t know what to tell you
Thats a pretty scary statement Most games are pretty low econ anyways which really promotes micro multitasking and build orders People like having the epic high econ macro games which promotes smaller skirmishes around the map due to more bases It would be nice to have a change
I think this is a common misconception You can absolutely make crazy maps that aren t going to be 1 or 2 base centric Hell you can even make them strongly promote macro play
I hope so If we get to vote in the future those maps have mine
THE RETURN OF ALTERZIM STRONGHOLD
Go forward my child you have my blessing
Yeah it s really odd that they are wanting to promote experimentation but have always been SO rigid about the 8m2g 6hym2g thing BW had non gas bases and such and it was fine If a map has an odd base and you as the judges don t think it works in the map s context then don t choose that map But at least give the option
I remember a map where there was 3 gasses but one of them was exposed to low ground harass This i truly truly truly hope we can see more of
freedom in resources would be nice yes but I swear if someone brings up mixing rich and normal minerals again ill do something to them
This is probably the highest amount of freedom map makers had Perhaps we can be grateful of the direction look at how this mappool works out and try changes to min gas layout if all things seem ok I also think that is the exact carefully balanced testing process blizzard does and wants
wait so this is for Season 1 The Season 1 that starts in like 3 or 4 days That does not seem like a lot of time to build a map let alone review test them edit since I read commented they updated the post to include a submission date I m still confused though since they are saying Season 1 a few times but Season 1 starts much sooner than the deadline so I dunno
There are no dates anywhere atm I m trying to get an answer back for me and the other mapmakers Edit Okay it seems that they are planning this for the 2nd season of WCS and the deadline is Feb 10 This is a bit unnerving specially considering that to make a high quality map you can easily spend over a month of testing a tweaking and we have less than two weeks And this came right out of the blue where usually in past Plexa and other TL staff would give hints towards when a TLMC would start so we could initiate the machinery and get a nice pace by when the TLMC s where announced
I thought you map makers could shit out 5 high quality maps in 2 weeks You re telling me that it actually takes time and effort to make a high quality map Blasphemy
idk if I can find the inspiration within 2 weeks to even make 5 shitty ones
10th Holy crap that is short notice Well time for all of us to kick it into high gear then
kicking it into high gear meaning looking around in mid folders and look for anything you allready have thats worth submitting p its just not possible to make that many good maps within that time
Well if you do super light doodads which they seem to be adamant about anyway then it s probably possible to crank out a couple decent layouts in addition to whatever you already have They won t be super well tested but hey
That s the spirit
Only thing it says is that submissions are open until the 10th But yeah seems weird they re showing this as late as they are Extremely happy that they are doing it though
Before I made the inquiries it didn t say a date that was added later I m very very concerned regarding the abandon of TL as a platform for Mapmaking contests for anyone involved in the small knit mapmaking community this is a gaping hole TL has a huge amount of incredibly capable people that have a crapload of experience dealing with the contests I can t but in part feel back stabbed with this decision it feels so absurdly corporative all the while leaving mapmakers in apparent abandon and not as a community in itself but as a resource that can easily be tampered and exploited
there are gm s at blizzard
Sorry but I call bullshit here Players vs game designers I ll pick designers every time No disrespect to the community but you can t expect them to cut their on pay team out of the loop
Please check out the maps Blizz designers made in WoL I ll pick the community or KeSPA map makers over Blizz any day
Seems to me you re making an unfair comparison That was 5 years ago The game wasn t figured out back then
Blizzard made maps have always been terrible
It still says When you send us your maps we ll present your creations to the Balance Team where they ll test and review various maps to see what maps might make the cut to be used in the Ladder for 2016 Season 1 in Legacy of the Void That implies to me that they re looking for S1 ladder maps I know they updated it to have a Feb 10 submission deadline though so I m just confused all around
It says season 2 now The opening paragraph is a bit confusing upcoming season but the conclusion does say season 2 now
hooray for updates at least
Bring back Ganymede https ktvmaps wordpress com 2015 02 24 ktv ganymede
So when are we getting new maps on ladder Like in season 3 Edit Or like after wcs Winter
These community maps are for season 2 says so in the post As for season 1 Probably the same maps We haven t had them that long and there is no meta
You guys are awesome if restrictions aren t total shit I think you could submit some of your maps already made I m sure they re better than ladder
Also i kind of miss the 3 player maps i hated catellena and mgr at the time but looking back they had some awesome games
yeah that seems a bit weird I imagine they ll just run current maps til the results are out and then implement them or they misspoke and ment they ll be used in s2
I have this terrible feeling we re stuck with the same maps next season
Welcome to the disorganized under staffed organization that owns the game we love
Well they say season 1 2016 upcoming season etc And it seems that its Blizzard team that ll review pick them
It now says season 2 Makes more sense
Well one more season with this map pool
s2 for sure
yeah I ve heard they ve updated the post again since D Glad to hear it
its being years since the 8m 2g maps why cant blizz let map makers change that and explore new creative way of making maps i want to believe
This will be cool
We are looking creative maps with these and these and these restrictions that massively limit their creativity Again
What s Melee
maps fit for games within the standard ladder ruleset no custom units spells all bases have set resource ammounts no scripts on the map etc
standard 1v1
The best Super Smash Brothers game
read the title thought I was on r ssbm
no standard maps not even one How can a base line for balance or what balance is intended to look like or operate in the game be set if a standard map is not present At such a point how is it possible to know if maps are contributing heavily to imbalances rather then a true imbalance of unit design Really don t agree with having only creative unique quirky map designs across the board Balance on everything in the game and changes to units will be based on what occurs on these maps in tournaments Wheres the middle ground
The SC2 LotV team the Donald Trump regime of gaming
If only they allowed a map with water for the units to travel through like Anaconda or Bel Shir Beach those would definitely be unique even if there was only one of them
why is it so late like wtf
Because it s for s2 not this season but next
Wish there were not those design restrictions They are looking for creative after all of course things would have to be within reason but still those values should be changeable
There are nearly no design restrictions if i am not missing something The only restrictions for design is the neutral structure stats and base mineral and gas counts Other than that there are no non visual restrictions whatsoever
There is a section on design restrictions that give specific on number of resource nodes etc Yep that is what I am referring to Perhaps design was not the best word I could care less about the visual appeal of the maps
I mean 2 gaysers and 8 or 6 normal or high yield minerals respectively is the least amount of restrictions that are offered since the beginning of WoL Note that there is no accessible natural and third requirements There is no 1 forcefield sized main ramp requirements Nothing pertaining to airspace map size etc
They are not looking for things truly creative they are looking for Creative it is very Blizz like I m not a friend of it by all means but that s what we have to work with
blizzard hears community is upfront about literally no map change for the new season despite many of them are disliked a lot blizzard thinks what they could do to solve this blizzard makes map contest 2 weeks time to finish them no prizes maps will still not be in the next season pool
We ll make sure we add a few more details to clear up confusion such as the correct season they will be used in Season 2 but I d also like to do so here Why didn t we do this earlier There was a lot going on around launch and directly after Usually the lead time for these things takes a while But more than that we also wanted to provide some time to let the game settle a bit after launch and watch map makers adapt their creations to that Why not a TLMC We ve had some early discussions and there s a possibility that the upcoming season may be shorter than normal Nothing is decided but with that possibility existing it makes it difficult for us to commit to doing a TLMC which needs a long lead time Ideally when running those contests we d like to shoot for 10 weeks ahead We could shorten the timeline a bit but with a new expansion we also didn t want to skimp on the time that QA would have to test out a community created map Why does it say Map Submission and not Map Contest Our plan was to actually check out maps that community had already made Maps on Team Liquid and from top map makers However if we did that behind the scenes all map makers may not be aware we re on the hunt for new community maps We thought at least making it public and allowing the map makers to submit their best directly to us would allow them to highlight their favorites We still plan to do more map contests in the futures so this isn t a permanent change We ve loved working with Team Liquid and have been really happy with how past contests have turned out So you can still be on the lookout for similar map contests with them in the future What do you mean by creative maps As some have mentioned here there is a tendency for players to fall in love with maps that look amazing Which is perfectly fine However as we do more of these we really want to make sure the focus is on the design In that case we d prefer a map that may need a little polish on the art but has a fun design We had even considered doing a contest where maps were voted on before art was applied in the past It s true that not all original or creative maps work out Trying something new and predicting how it will play out can be difficult Still we don t want that to discourage people coming up with new designs We re looking forward to checking out all of the great map everyone has been working on
Oh wow that s a detailed response You should have posted that under a more prominent post so everyone will read it But thank you anyway for this response
I find standard maps fun It allows me to play the style i want to play and use all the units i want to use
Thanks for the transparency
I wonder if it will really be no prizes Last TLMC was 1k for first and 500 for second or something not huge money or anything but it gives a little incentive
Blizzard confirmed no prizes for this when inquired the wording of the post was careful to avoid things like contest as well to make sure it was clear it wasn t anything with awards
Weird I wonder if they are looking to avoid any potential legal issues or something It seems highly unlikely that the money itself is an issue 2k or whatever the total prize pool was last time is such a drop in the bucket for them
you forgot the part where they made sure no hope was possible for the next season either by locking out all standard maps
by blizzard this time oddly enough interesting 5 entry slots is nice not sure if I like that theyre reinforcing their rule on creative maps
Why not do this a month earlier so there are new maps ready for the next season s mappool Oh right I forgot it s fucking Blizzard
We want creativity No standards Here are our standards you must follow wowwwwwwww go fuck yourself with the mineral gas requirements
Why not Why can t we have both standards and gimmicky maps like prion and ulrena This promotes different builds and play styles it literally keeps the game more interesting As long as the gimmick does not interfere with the players interactive maps for example lava rising and falling that could wipe out your entire army or maybe trains passing by blocking some passages for a few seconds these are bad imo I am completely fine with it
why are those bad I feel like there is a lot of very interesting things to be explored in that regard I would love to see a map where not all attack paths are open at every moment That would mean that sometimes you would be able to attack but not retreat etc I think it would be very cool to see what can be accomplished with these kind of gimmicks
Ulrena is fine but Prion is significantly imbalanced in ZvP Central Protocol is also terrible for Protoss Same goes for Lerilak Crest It s fine to have maps that are a bit funky but not at a complete disadvantage for a race
I agree only with Prion as it s a map I vetoed out for more than 2 months now The others I don t see how they re so unbalanced maybe they slightly favor zerg
They should give some sort of reward for having a map selected even if it s just a unique achievement or portrait
They should make one for coop maps too
What if the main opened up to two naturals that way the player can decide which one to go for i e There are two raps in the main leading to a natural For variety an example for a choice could be an extra gas geiser vs extra mineral patches Or one could be made a higher risk higher reward base Something like that I feel like if the mineral patch and geiser restrictions were lifted it would lead to more variety in maps What if there was a 8 patch gold base with no gas
is it April 1st already It s weird that they didn t collab with TL since TL has had map contests before Asks community to be creative but sets a bunch of restrictions And you only have 2 weeks to make one lol It s like Blizzard has no idea what they fucking want And considering how terrible Blizzard s maps have always been I bet the worse your map is designed the more likely it ll win Hell just add a bunch of destructible rocks and you ll get the Browder s vote
Let s hope the winner doesn t go the way of Metropolis For the uninformed there was a vote that got this GSL map into the ladder maps but when this found to cause an fps issue with certain users it was removed and never heard of again
why is this tagged meta this has nothing to do with this subreddit
For guideline Blizz standard definition for creative diverse map pool A back door or tons of back doors A rock or tons of rocks By definition tons of back door rocks are the best Gold bases the more the better Legends said that a map with only gold bases is the pinnacle of creativity Massive dead space is encouraged because why not Chokes are for losers high ground mains and nat are for bronzie Any map with defender advantage will be disqualified There is no exception Bonus points will be given for maps with extremely short rush distance or extremely long rush distance If you manage to have both you have double the bonus points GLHF EDIT I m going to submit a map with vision tower every 10 steps or so I m pretty sure I will get far Wish me luck
ohh love this
Excuse me blizzard since when prion terraces is creative map You made third and fourth bases as gold on a standard map to fuck the map up and u call that creative
I like the non restrictive tone but i hope creative does not lead to prion terraces no 2
The excessive use of the word doodad is making me uncomfortable
With enough time in the BW editor making maps filled with thousands of lings and marines in helms deep scenarios pre helms deep of course the word doodad is always followed by that deep ping sound every time you tried to place it incorrectly oh and Map editor WHHRROOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMSSSHHHH that sound never gets old
You just gave me deep rooted ptsd
They somehow forgot to mention deadlines and prizes
There will be no prizes deadline is in there now
srsly blizzard balance team you are the worst
they are going to adress it by saying they are looking into it
Internal testing proved that leave league bug actually increases the level of skill required to master the game
This needs to be addressed in a community feeback thread Can t wait for the test map
That they haven t hot fixed it by now suggests to me that they might not be able to fix it in its current state and or the bug will no longer be an issue with the planned ladder revamp
So we ll be waiting until 2018
Fuck that I promise if they give me access to the code I can fix it and I have never done any game programming before How hard can it be to remove a fucking button from the UI We re not asking them to fix the broken ladder algorithm in a hot fix
First of all removing a button can be much harder than you think You change a small thing bugs start happening because of shitty code someone wrote 5 years ago and nobody noticed or cared Second of all while removing the button is absolutely doable and probably easy it s also a shitty solution They want to fix the algorithm not remove options Spending money to temporarily remove a button they will have to return shortly after can look very bad on reports
I am pretty sure I can remove the fucking button Now of course I will not remove it as in delete the code I will simply make it invisible and unclickable Since there are no bugs related to not clicking the button it is obvious that it is highly unlikely that other code will break from the button becoming invisible They are welcome to fix the actual algorithm when they see fit and return the button shortly but shortly has now extended for several months
Does their UI system support invisible buttons
It is very hard to not support them Certainly you can override the render method to not do anything
99 little bugs in the code 99 little bugs Take 1 down patch it around 127 little bugs in the code
It has nothing to do with the button it s the process of reverting you back to placement status without altering MMR And I promise as a programmer with years of experience that this kind of issue is embedded in the logic which is probably hundred of thousand of lines of code in which one single return variable affects parent functions or is incorrect after instantiating the Leave Ladder process which trickles down and causes the current problem I agree taking this long is not good but it is not as simple as re writing the entire function what ever is causing it it is much more difficult than you would think to trace and fix Debugging is one of the longest and most important steps and getting one thing wrong could go as far as to wipe the entire ladder then how you you feel
I have almost a decade of professional programming experience and I am aware how hard fixing the actual bug can be The bug itself is relatively harmless and while it should be fixed fixing it is not urgent The problem is that the bug is being abused and it is being abused via the button They should hide the button and take their time to track down the actual bug and test the fix
I have no game programming experience I do have enterprise software experience As for the leave league button it punishes very little people very mildly since people rarely leave league and they can certainly go a few months without leaving a league After all the game was released without this button and nobody thought to complain for a year
Very few people use the button legitimately Of course you want to punish the majority of people who abuse it As for the debugging I probably won t be able to track and fix a bug like this in an unknown codebase but I certainly can hide a stupid button That was my whole point Fixing the bug may be hard Hiding the button is easy I don t claim to be very good at English but I am confident you are either trolling me or failing reading comprehension
Weird response What details should David Kim provide other than it s a bug and we re working to fix it
We now announce that we will start talking about it soon
It only took what 2 months to be addressed Something that has been crippling some players only source of practice should have been fixed sooner Hopefully this addressing of the issue doesn t take as long as a patch
So why does the stuck joining a lobby bug still persist a year later
This issue has been ongoing since release standard Blizzard waiting until its too late to fix damage
whats the issue ive never heard of it
If you leave your league the system will put you against high GM players it s been persistent since the start of LOTV This problem affects GMs most because they are CONSTANTLY vsing people who stand no chance and earn between 2 and 5 points for beating them then lose above 20 points when they lose to those players
Long overdue Should have been fixed ages ago
I bet they are waiting for next community feedback because they will talk about the ladder revamp
Why can t you guys have mindset like MarineLorD in that twitter post I am srsly sick of this constantly trash talking on Blizz I love starcraft and I am enjoying it even if getting rekted by Adepts all day long
About fucking time
Next community feedback IT S A BUG JUST HOTFIX IT
just fucking fix it jfc
What a great time to be alive
Hell it s about time
Context
No one here has explained what the problem is I m unfamiliar with the leave league bug can someone update me
sad they cant fix this been around for so long inexcusable
this is an announcement for an announcement
Should ve told us in a week at least that it was on their radar It s been two months and we get a tweet saying that it will be addressed
is psione a community volunteer or is he an actual paid employee I am trying to figure out if i should be annoyed with psione He made an annoucement of an annoucement How is that professional There is no way an adult for a company like that would be hired
You just realized how Blizzard works Congratz
How is it an announcement of an announcement Marinelord asked if it was being looked into He answered that it was and that David Kim would have more information at a later time
he answers a question that someone asks him on twitter OMG HOW UNPROFESSIONAL IT S AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT HE DOESN T DESERVE TO HAVE A JOB
This is as if America would be confirming that II world war might have started and they are looking into it now in 2016
pull out front teeth Ith okai guiz the leef leeg bug ithn t real ith juth people being thalty Le Redditors after Scarlett s match history post left the front page
erm what the actual hell is going on here What else are they really working hard on that is just stopping them from getting the time to implement the changes to the ladder bug asap Either they are working on a lot of changes for the short term future that they have no told us about yet or they are just being plain lazy and dont seem to care Its 1 bug 1 bug that should be pretty easy to fix since its super obvious and everyone is experiencing it I m so confused with the way they are dealing with stuff since release
The bug may be obvious but how to fix it is not Anyone who has had the pleasure of coding and working through large projects is all to familiar with how often you break things by trying to fix them
Yeah the is only that one bug so they must be lazy Geesh Just read this forum and find dozens of things people are asking for Chat fixes 8 bit map preview changes to tournaments create game bug in EU the new Ghost mission further updates for co op balance testing Yeah you nailed it Lazy
He did by far the best interviews and StarCraft hasn t seen anything like them since then
And his opinion pieces were pretty good I remember when in 2010 I think or early 2011 he argued that JaeDong should be considered a bonjwa and brought like this massive list of reason etc out it was super well researched It was the first article ever that made me think how we used that term and how thats kinda off and look at like given opinions in the community more critical and not as if they were facts So yea its a shame he doesn t want to write SC2 anymore and that BW isn t giving him any money
Wai who doesn t consider JD a bonjwa
A lot of BW fans because Flash was better at a similar time
FlaSh was better almost 1 year after JaeDong started dominating but people don t care because FlaSh won vs him before he fell off And its not only because of FlaSh there are still people who to this day argue that FlaSh shouldn t be considered a bonjwa
Flash got a higher recondition than bonjwa he was called God The term bonjwa was somewhat tainted after match fixing and was basically not used again So Flash got a title that transcended bonjwa
That doesn t mean both can t be bonjwas and flash barely beat JD out in head to head I mean JD had a 90 winrate in zvz at one point Is Bisu not a bonjwa either in their eyes I mean he reinvented pvz into what it is today
You have to consider what Bonjwa actually means It means that you were dominating and far superior to everyone else at your era
JaeDong did in 2009 before FlaSh rose up he has some of the sickest records in individual leagues beating a lot of the records of the 4 old bonjwas not FlaSh ofcourse but thats unfair
Yeah I mean it is very debatable don t remember exactly how it looked a year prior to Flash starting his dominance Wasn t Bisu up there with Jaedong Even though they don t have many head to head it seems
They actually didn t meet that much Bisu was doing better in 2008 but still good in 2009 but JaeDong absolutely dominated in 2009 winning back to back OSL and stuff
Based on head to head Flash wasn t far superior to JaeDong though so if we go by that definition The Ultimate Weapon was also not a bonjwa
Well yeah it is debatable and there are a group of people who don t think that Flash was a Bonjwa within the applied definition However you also have to look at the big picture Flash was pretty much dominant in every other regard except for head to head vs Jaedong
But then this comes back to Thorin s point in his video titled There s no Such Thing as a Bonjwa no player meets all of the defined requirements to be a bonjwa It would be much easier if the term was more relaxed on what it required because those labeled as bonjwas by the community don t even meet the requirements
It s sort of defined in reverse though you decide who is a bonjwa then base your definition of bonjwa on that
This argument died like 5 years ago just let it go
Lol I really don t need you telling me what I need to care or not care about Thx anyways
Most of the BW community
He s been doing some videos on the Bonjwa topic lately I would also go back and watch the video he did about a year ago on the players that collected 2nd places if that topic interests you
That I agree and during the time he was actually writing the articles I would hold his opinion on wcs with tact But for two to three years he payed less attention to the scene and openly admits he doesn t watch any of the games He bases his opinion on WCS changes with outdated opinions While him posting his esports resume for the community is nice it doesn t mean he s immune to negative feedback after he rants about a major change on a one sided talk show with really bad moderation
Chanman be spineless like a larva
He produced good content but none of it is really relevant to discussing WCS 2016 so I m not sure what he s trying to prove I don t think that many of the points that he raised on unfiltered were very well thought out which is pretty much the extent of the problem I had with the episode
You whole scene and all of complaint against him
I mean I think most of the complaints I ve seen were about Thorin s recent involvement and his arguments not what interviews he made in 2012 3 so again I don t really see what he s trying to prove https www reddit com r starcraft comments 4309nw unfiltered esports 1 w chanmanv richard lewis and
People of the SC2 were arguing he knows nothing about the scene or that he was only in it for the money Those were the criticisms or personal attacks that he was trying to prove false in this article
It is relevant to the people on this subreddit who are constantly trying to say he has nothing to do with the scene so he knows nothing about it Clearly the amount and variety of work shows otherwise
To be honest people wont like this being said Regardless of what you think of thoorin and im not saying he is right OR wrong Im just stating the fact If you honestly think he s clueless about our scene then frankly you re stupid You can t ignore facts He is more informed than the casual r starcraft poster Maybe its not his game right now fair enough Doesn t mean he can t have an opinion Debate his opinion don t use the lazy argument of HURR HURR SOMEONE FAMOUS SED HE DOESNT KNOW SHIT SO EAT SHIT THOORIN YOU KNOW NOTHING Give in your own words why you think he s wrong
Agree completely and to be honest you don t need to have specific knowledge of the SC scene as long as you can base your arguments on what has happened elsewhere or just plain logic
With regards to the scene noone was talking about his historical knowledge But rather what the scene is like in terms of salaries motivation viewer numbers
Everything isn t a debate ive found his content mediorce this guy can say hes got 169 things archived but why would i listen to his opinion Everyone says tasteless is has no passian but this dudes got at least 30x that This is coming from someone who watches his analysis of csgo as well i can tell you as someone who s played cs for 8 years and is LE dude knows very little about the very core basics of the game he takes every out of perspective and makes a big deal about it I guess hes interesting to players of lower levels but i can t fault him there we need people like that Anyways his 160 archive is not a lot dont see why he needs the proof to show sc2 still not impressive The only reason i care is because hes making it sound like we did something to him or owe him Sorry you contributed and didnt get recognized for it but you didnt do enough to be remembered
Did you actually just use your rank of LE as a credential for being knowledgeable about cs LOL
its proof that I play the game which thorin does not
He was actually above LE at one point nice facts tho

god help you mate
thanks man
if hes right or wrong who cares ok lets say thorin knows nothing about starcraft his idea of where compeittive starcraft stands is totally uninformed ok so what how does that affect anything
So you re saying that if I think he contributes so very little to the scene anyway why should I care It s just a little random and late to say aloud I WAS PART OF SOMETHING AND YOU GUYS DIDNT LIKE ME SO YOU FORCE ME TO LEAVE when we all knew you didn t have the guts to be cut out for it in the first place I dont care im just commenting that hes poison everywhere he goes
if his opinion is stupid because its based on a faulty conclusion then theres nothing to debate
yeah but he says things i don t want to hear

this is the sc2 community as a whole and explains why this community is shit
I really want to see an in dept study of circle jerking within online communities and how quickly one post can make people pull a 180 I also wonder how many people upvoting this now liking Thorin were in the opposite camp a few hours back
This outrage has been going overboard for awhile Richard and Thorin are invaluable to any scene they re apart of even if they come off brash edgy and polarizing I don t like the way Thorin disparaged some community figure heads but I don t think his actions came out as anything less than defensive after so many notable individuals attacked him When you re getting ganged up on it doesn t matter how inconsequential something you say might be that person will probably take offense to it Everyone has needed to take a break regarding this entire last week and come to this subject at a later date Even pushing back Unfiltered Esports back a week would have actually calmed down alot of the outrage here I don t think people here generally dislike either of those dudes and I don t think we ll even care about this in the weeks to come Chanman says his topic choice is what caused the problem I would guess it was more timing than anything So yeah everyone chill the fuck out And if you consider yourself the least bit notable in this community I hope you reach out and do your best to communicate some sort of light solidarity like HuK already has Stuff like that can really quell the tempers in this sub or any fanbase
Its when those people who hate someone over something rather irrelevant to themselves effect those that like to consume SC2 content is the really offense the way I see it personally Because that is exactly what happens I haven t played the game in probably 2 3 years but I watch tournaments and qualifiers with the time I used to spend playing games When I see people get bullied out because of feel bads I don t grab a pitch fork Yeah that guy sucks get outta here NoNo I immediately think the community sucks for pushing away people that create content Content is what drives the machine of interest Just me maybe but probably not
Thorin certainly doesn t do himself any favours in terms of people forcing him out He creates good content but it seems like any time he opens his mouth outside of a good piece of writing or an informative video he acts like a complete douche bag The same goes with Dick Lewis
That s just it though What do people who are making it more difficult for them really accomplish Nothing positive that is for sure Maybe the personal feel goods of grieving someone I suppose The lurkers content consumers suffer the most It s ignorance to see it otherwise Less content is less content Like it or not their content actually has substance And if it s like you say only outside of their content they act alike a jerk well why should I care I ve never once been attacked by either Better yet what do the naysayers bring in it s place Drama maybe Fleeting and if you can manage to look past the moment you realize you just got a sour deal If you can t see it then maybe you care about drama more then content creation Good way to burn a house down
RL had a really tumultuous relationship with the subreddit mods leading up to that doxxing Ultimately all he ever did was publish that moderators name from what I remember It might be in poor taste but at some point if someone is actively or perspectively threatening your income it can lead you to do some pretty brash stuff Richard definitely goes overboard and the altercation at dreamhack is just another point you can cite as evidence to that Though that was equal parts unnecessary drama and escalation from all involved parties Thorin has more self awareness in that regard and conducts himself in physical realms accordingly He s a cheeky bastard online but mostly because he hates fanboys And who doesn t In some regards you have to let peoples work speak for itself I ll keep consuming whatever content they put out because in spite of their various faults its amazing content If you enjoy their work and trust them to give you a fair shake you couldn t do better than Thorin or Richard as far as esports goes They ll always advocate for you depending on the situation Sour as it maybe in the way they conduct themselves there s no point in their career where any nobody like you or me has much ground to stand on in comparison to what they ve contributed to the industry I fully agree if you don t like them don t work for or with them Their distaste for bullshit reflects in their personality as they deal with it poorly I love those guys and I won t come out of this hating them Just disappointed
And here it is http i imgur com 7EYYn2M png http imgur com LbskKhK http i imgur com Hflzuxl png http i imgur com cWhSOKL png That group page has all contact info backed up into it I don t ever recall any request of it being taken down
You not noticing the irony of mocking him for defending Richard while stalking him in order to argue him is pretty rich
How the fuck am I stalking him when this thread got linked and was browsing the comment section What s even more ironic is how you literally mirror his behavior also
Point out where I ve defended Richard at all here Got nothing No Figures you make unsolicited claims you can t back up like normal Also don t think you understand what ironic means But hey I m sure you just happened to stumble onto comments regarding Richard Lewis You re such a fan after all Oh and you were linked here from somewhere else huh So definitely not brigading I bet Lol mods would never be so hypocritical right
I guess IRC channels are something you re not familiar with Maybe you should ask G2Wolf about how to join one
He never posted his work with alt accounts That is an outright lie Edit I couldn t write a full out reply when I first saw this and knew one wasn t necessary when this guy was that blatant I know this considering he was a strict adherent to the reddit 10 1 rule He would consistently post news stories to r news and r worldnews to follow the self promotion rules He was banned for posting reddit links on twitter much like totalbiscuit has been before him That was the offical reasoning vote brigading
The main reason RL is banned from the LoL sub is bc he openly criticized riot for being a shady ass company multiple times that s only how his conflict with the mods really startet
RL never doxxed anybody
Its a problem with many journalists today Gamergate shows that pretty well
I think the power associated with being considered one of the foremost thinkers and journalists for a new movement e sports has simply gone to his head The megalomaniac differs from the narcissist by the fact that he wishes to be powerful rather than charming and seeks to be feared rather than loved To this type belong many lunatics and most of the great men of history
Hes in a better place now anyway earning more than any of these figures put together most likely Thorin speaks his mind and the CS scene has embraced it we told him to fuck off Guys the most valuable e sports journalist and we told him to fuck off zzZ
Thorin doesn t speak his mind He is the Miley Cyrus of esports he does and says controversial things to attempt to stay relevant and it works everyone is talking about him
The reason he is relevant in counter strike is he produces high quality content watches every meaningful high level game and has been doing so for over 10 years He doesn t have to try to stay relevant in esports because he is and thats why people are talking about him and his opinions
Doing excellent work doesn t make you immune to criticism Being a cunt every now and then doesn t mean you aren t excellent at your work People on both sides of this need to chill out
And especially in the newer past he was a plain idiot Good interviews and stuff in the past Nice I praised him therefore But lately no one with a brain can say he has a grasp of the current SC2 scene Or living in a dreamland were all countries were the same EVERY fucking professional sport protects it s local leagues It s beyond stupid to argue against it In reality what that would mean is being against the sport and real competition itself Instead of growing the sport and allow regional competition WHICH HELPS GROWING THE SCENE OVERALL Only complete idiot can argue against that
The problem isnt that blizzard is supporting foreign scene The problem is that they are doing so by removing the old WCS tournaments and region locking actually just banning south koreans the open tournaments that everyone was able to play in Is blizzard just saving money or what i dont know but if not then why wouldn t they let dreamhacks and iems stay the way they were and hold additional regional tournaments like the first year of WCS for foreign players
It s ok guys Thorin doesn t know anything about the Starcraft 2 scene
I believe he uses this face
yea the face is the german smiley not the Thorin one people really need to get their facts straight tbh fam
people don t know anything about the passive aggressive smiley face scene
I used to be a pro at it when i was an angsty teen D
deleted
Sure he knew things about 2011 2013 SC2 And Broodwar But he s been out of it for three years That s not irrelevant
I mean Even if that s true that doesn t mean he can t have an opinion on WCS right now
Of course Everyone is entitled to their opinion NOBODY is entitled to bully tactics stirring up shit for the sake of it and presenting their opinion as the only valid opinion That s what Thorin does if you ask me
Isn t that what the other side does Saying that this is so good for the scene without actually presenting any arguments other than more money for me
thats not true at all looks like you were sleeping last couple days
Really
I don t agree with Thorin on the WCS issue but you re basically saying Everybody is entitled to their opinion but only when I say they are
No that s not what I m saying at all I said nobody is allowed to behave like a douche In my opinion Thorin behaves like a douche He can be a douche and still have an opinion But he shouldn t be a douche about his opinion
What are you Hitler
like what mate
Hes really well researched and few people have the charisma or ability to coverse with him He can be abrasive but not the same as what you re saying Most people in esports arent well spoken he is
Maybe you should try to be a bit more updated before you continue spewing out bullshit Possibly check what Chanmanv wrote on Facebook several hours ago
I did read it
Then stop spreading lies on purpose please If you have read it then you should know that what you just wrote is far from the truth
That turned out to be a misunderstanding lie
I don t believe he s charismatic He s enormously abrasive and will resort to straight up insults in a debate He IS well spoken But I do not believe that s the same thing as charismatic
We just disagree on how abrasive Also i only like him for his csgo commentaries Ive been out of sc2 for a while
Thats fair Thorin does really solid work when he isn t trying to be an edge lord I haven t seen any CS GO stuff but I have certainly enjoyed some of his stuff through the years
deleted
I mean I don t know the context of your statement im not defending him really He can be really rough and abrasive But he does own most people I speak in terms of csgo though No idea what hes said about sc2 Not my game anymore I just casually stay up to date now
Given that he was making content for SC2 in 2014 and it s now 2016 he s been out of the scene for a year Might want to work on your maths skills mate
Was he I know he did an interview with Nani as he left but wasn t that it Point stands

I m at no point saying thorin can t have an opinion In saying it isn t as informed as he seems to think it is And it isn t Yes he wrote articles in 2014 Granted Still over a year back Still a ton of time and space where he s been completely out of the loop That s enormously relevant Hes entitled to his opinion He can t act like his is the right opinion though And he does That isn t how opinions work They can t be right or wrong like that And this dude has a large gap of knowledge on which he s basing his opinion
His knowledge of the scene stems mainly from 2012 13 Which is before the major issues with Korean sc2 even started KeSPA was still running rookie systems the Koreans hadn t all left for easy money and there were still big non KeSPA teams That all changed at about the time he left He s still talking as if Korea is the same as it was 3 years ago he s dead wrong on most of what he says
To be honest Thorin and RL are probably the best western journalists that eSport have
Which sucks
It s a fool s errand Who the fuck in their right mind wants to go around telling fans that their favorite pro organization tournament organizer or developer is anything less than divine Invariably you will end up with individuals who are either incompetent or have some personality imperfection that lets them do the job
There are tons of examples of investigative journalists in other fields that disprove that
I imagine there are professional journalists working for ESPN who are learning very very fast now that their eSports vertical is up and running I personally am hunting for non RL Thorin content due to the lack of professionalism alone IMO physical assault insulting your audience etc is really uncalled for
Thorin has never been a go to content creator for me I was also put off by his tweets last week That having been said I do agree that the SC2 community in general can be very toxic and hostile at times so I sympathize with him on that level I feel like the knee jerk black and white reactions from SC2 fans are alot of times negative for the community on a whole
I ll admit that I have never been more than a casual fan of Starcraft as an esport in the past and now I can t say that I ve watched more than a couple of games in about one year However everywhere that I see controversy in this scene being mentioned it s always accompanied by a fierce us and them mentality nowadays There are the loyal starcraft fans and then there s everyone else in esports No one outside of the group is allowed to joke about ded gaem etc or they are assholes Only the big personalities are allowed to have controversial opinions on the happenings in the scene Does it really have to be this way I m sure that if the atmosphere was less negative we could all get along a lot better and there wouldn t be this weird alienation between the different esports games
I actually got a lot of respect for wolf through that not because of what he thinks neccessarily but because of the fact he stated his opinion almost all big personalities in SC2 went apeshit on Thorin so it would have been much easier for him to just not say anything
Wolf s been awesome Both at his job and otherwise
He s great and I like him a lot but at times he feels as a korean elitist of some sort
When the scene was new didn t people consider TB only entering it for the money Tbh this scene has had some built in issues for a while
I don t know about that Just compare the CSGO scene with the SC2 scene for example If you insult CSGO and talk about how shit of a game it is they d probably laugh and nod in agreement instead of being insecure and defensive about it There are definitely some psychological differences
Of course you are allowed to be defensive when someone insults you difference is that some things that are taken as insults are not meant as insults to the community members They are simply differing opinions in many cases
Criticism out of nowhere from someone unrelated and without clarification will most likely be taken as insults If not the best that can happen is if they are ignored They are never going to be taken as valid constructive criticism
I never said that you have to listen or respond to people that you think are irrelevant to the scene and the question at hand If you think that someone is unrelated then why even react at all
I don t know i have been saying ignore for every thread whatsoever The real question is if it is clear that what you say is only can only evoke a neutral or bad response why say it publicly Actually i don t even blame the people that reacted negatively People know little about our scene while the people that commented have big followings They are spreading misinformation to the masses which does have a negative effect For me ignoring is the provides the best result but it can also be perceived as a confirmation So i would say what would you expect What would you wanted people to do
I don t think that it can only evoke a neutral or bad response from every group twitter is about letting your followers know your opinion on matters that concern you In the case of Thorin I think it s a pretty big exaggeration to say that he is misinformed on this subject He just holds the opinion that the changes are unequivocally bad I would rather see other informed people debating the issue if they think that confronting Thorin s opinion is important to the scene That s what HuK could have done on Unfiltered Unfortunately that didn t happen but circlejerking in several threads talking about how ignorant and malicious Thorin supposedly is just seems unproductive and is part of the negative atmosphere that I m talking about
what is this none of these articles are brainless sc2 circlejerks talking about how le great the le game is compared to everything else that is the standard for sc2 content just ask nathanias memespewing neckbeard extraordinaire
nathanis will say how awful these articles are without reading them
Just for proof that u Makkron isn t talking out of his ass https archive is 78pL6 https archive is gHt4z The tweets are now deleted without an apology
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THE MEMER HAS BEEN MEMED GET YOUR RARE PEEPS AND FRESH BEATS HERE AT THE ARCHIVE EMPORIUM RUINING YOUR IMAGE SINCE 2009
Please deactivate
Proof that Nathanias had 2h20min to read the article you mean As the article blew up on twitter of course he would read it to join in on the fun
Read through them 10 hours before he says he didn t read them he says shatterfront ESPN Esports I m sure the shitter who wrote this did it for the chance to be an ass more than for money they want clickbait and arianity2 shatterfront ESPN Esports both are awful
https twitter com nathaniastv status 691173835169742848
He later apologised and said he misspoke
and then go on a twitter rant like a 16 year old girl to make himself look like his shitcan of an opinion matters the sc2 scene really is a culmination of the most deluded man children ive ever seen
Dota and Starcraft the 2 most dysfunctional esports communities
To be honest Thorin and RL are probably the best western journalists that eSport have
I don t think anyone that knows what they re talking about will disagree with you But there s a difference between being a good journalist and being a helpful member of the community Seems like a lot of their articles and written content are generally helpful and invigorating to the communities they touch But if you look at Thorin s Thoughts and at their respective twitter feeds they are children in adult form The end product is they provide a lot of great content helping the communities but turn away outsiders by acting like total douchenozzles hurting the communities They may be the best journalists we have but they will never be GREAT journalists if they maintain the maturity level of at 14 year old
Personally this depends on one variable for me If what RL and Thorin are saying about how people old boys are constantly trying to keep them from speaking the truth just to get money instead of focusing on the sustainability of the scene Then I think their attitudes are warranted when the community don t even want to hear about their favorite personalities being two faced scammers Then the community is indeed shit But however if they are lying about how they were treated by the old boys Then I 100 agree with you
That makes a lot of sense The whole situation is definitely pretty hard to read and it just takes things down from where they could be for all involved imo though drama can attract superficial attention in the short term
The thing is that as hard as it is to swallow if the viewership number for SC2 doesn t improve this year SC2 is 99 dead This year s WCS system is the hail Mary move from Blizzard to bank that most of SC2 s viewers only wants to see foreigner only If this fails it means that they either go back to bringing back Koreans but you already lost the viewership that would like to see Koreans competing with foreigners anyways
Well maybe he meant no one wanted to talk with him on talk shows discussing the scene and what not Interviews are about the person being interviewed Thorin almost never even appeared on camera in them
Are you ever planning on attacking his argument rather than his credibility
He has no argument he s just raging and ranting on a platform where he can rage and rant with no one to respond to He s acting like a petulant child he threw away any chance of an argument yesterday on Unfiltered It s strange as much as people compare me to Thorin I ve never been interested in circle jerking opinions It s why I always jump at getting someone on Skype who disagrees with me or having someone on the show who can present an alternate point of view in an articulate manner It s one of the reasons I appreciate Geoff so much even if we disagree The idea of creating a safe space by going onto a show where I can talk about a controversial opinion with no one to disagree with me sounds absolutely insane What kind of a coward are you to do something like that And then to act surprised when the community takes issue with what you re saying and go to Twitter another hug box and just relentlessly shit on the community Thorin s pretty done here he has no spine when it comes to this It s why he d rather stick with his own shows or stick with people who will never contradict anything he says
As much as this has become an emotionally fueled issue for you I don t think Thorin s argument is weak so much as it is short sighted for the longevity of the game Regardless of that Thorin has always been able to have a pretty level headed and rather calm method of arguing his points in anything I ve ever seen him in Your strengths tend to gravitate around being well thought out in a short amount of time at the cost of coming out pretty flamboyant or overly enthusiastic in their execution Thorin doesn t seem to mesh well with the heavy loud type of arguing you really shine in and I think that s whats upsets him more than anything else So basically screaming yelling tends to fuel elevated emotions and he responds to that poorly for whatever reason It could be he either simply doesn t like it or he falls short in making calm logical rebuttals which result in massive generalizations like the Poland debacle Very few good arguments I ve seen you get in have you remaining collected but again I don t really fault you for this I eat that shit up I just think it gives a conversation a specific tinge of something Thorin might not want to be involved in as a result of not wanting to become emotional himself
The way you conduct yourself here and how you simply dismiss the argument out of hand without really grasping it at all is all the reason one would need to never engage with you in an argument Now put on top your inability to let people get a word in and it s pretty obvious why people don t want to engage in an argument with you I ve seen you literally scream I CAN T let you continue to explain yourself at debate opponents Obviously you rustle all the right jimmies with that behaviour when it comes to thorin and he is obviously at fault for that too If I were him and I would ve burned myself twice trying to argue with you I also wouldn t trust either you or myself to have a decent debate after that I agree they should ve had someone else with a stronger presence than ChanmanV on the show but from the explanations we have gotten that was more ChanmanV s fault than Thorin s
The problem is anyone who had a opposite opinion Chanman wouldn t let on because Thorin would then retreat and not bother to come on the show this is why HuK and Destiny weren t allowed to come on the show
Again that s not true at all and has been proven to be false Thorin even offered to do a show with Rotterdam and Huk himself
Its completely true Chanman even said himself he didnt want to let HuK on because he didnt want HuK and THORIN to fight and THORIN has even said he wont do shows with Destiny so what is false about any of that Thorin might be able to handle HuK sure that was all Chanman who decided not to bring HuK on but Thorin wouldnt be seen on any show with Destiny and has stated and done so in the past
You can t blame Thorin for not wanting to come on the show when it has been proven twice that these two can t have a discussion At this point it isn t about conflicting opinions but strictly about the personalities clashing Destiny is even more irritating in debate scenarios than thorin himself What you said which was inaccurate is that Chanman couldn t let Huk come on because Thorin would not participate then which again is proven to be false So clearly it isn t about opposing opinions as much as it is the personality Destiny
Destiny is the anti thorin he just has to be there to trigger him
Well as sure as is reasonable that s what Chanman said and Thorin also tweeted after that he d be down to have a discussion with HuK Rotti et al
Oh yeah Chanman is probably going to lie for Thorin I suppose just to save his ass Aren t you coming up with a few too many conspiracy theories here
Or you know you can watch the VOD yourself and clearly see that this is exactly what happened
Really Please link me to the point in any VOD where we can see that Chanman has been lying and is protecting Thorin
Dawg they are talking about HuK when thorin and chanman are talking about not letting people on It was previously established that thorin will not go on shows with destiny for whatever reason If you want a vod click on my profile and see something called chanman memes or some shit under submitted where it is strongly implied if not stated that thorin won t go on shows with destiny I d link it now but I m on mobile hope this helps clear things up lol Edit I say for whatever reason because thorin says it s because the arguments with destiny aren t productive whereas destiny says it s because thorin doesn t want to argue with someone who can argue back Regardless thorin said he wouldn t go on shows with destiny
Yeah this whole thing just sounds like a big miscommunication problem
If you check any other of the subreddits that Unfiltered got posted on people are appreciating Thorin and Richard for airing the dirty laundry and giving us a glimpse behind the curtains of Esports only here in SC2 people are all up in arms cause we have this need to artificially create drama to feel that we are important
Well thats been the whole fucking problem nobody was there to show a counter argument and present evidence to the contrary Thats why most people are up in arms there was no one there to debate with that
Which is Chanman s blame Not Thoorin or RL
I am still waiting for you to apologize for you baiting him into the Polish comment I find it outrageous how you could say Poland isn t that bad with a straight face After that Thorin had no other alternative than insulting the country and he wasn t invited to IEM as a consequence of your action For good measure S
So I guess the answer to that question is no
I like how you claim he s raging and doing highschool level posting but then again you re lesser man trying to continuously fuel the fire
it s destiny what do you think
Lol didn t you call him out originally for highschool level posting yet all you ve done is foster more drama and haven t even attempted to address his arguments or be mature about anything Stay autistic
Young Thorin looks like Apollo
Did somebody say Yung Thorin
You take that back Apollo is a fantastic gentlemen with the accent of mythical creature On a side note He does look surprisingly similar does Apollo hold the same fate as Thorin
They are Brits
I dont think being British means you look like all British people Unless you are talking about the accent then yea thats the boring way to state it
I appreciate this more from Thorin than when he goes and tries to just shit talk You can tell he takes passion in his work but for some reason he is unable to relate to people who work just as hard At least in pertaining to the WCS discussion he immediately belittles and berates the NA EU community When in reality most of the people are just as passionate and hard working as him I think most people are a bit sensitive on the topic and are quick to initiate their twitter fingers but there s a lot of heart on both sides I don t think I d be one to keep Thorin out of the scene over this disagreement I like to think both sides can be bigger and move on
he has written some very good content in the past sad how all of this turned out
You mean sad how the community just bandwagons against him even though he s probably the most knowledgable
Don t remember seeing anyone here say Thorin is a bad journalist hes just a cunt He turns into a child and shoves down his opinion down your throat like its a fact fires shots are you that have nothing to do with the topic at hand discredits you because apparently you re a piece of shit nobody and hes a big eSports journalist or something of the sort It s worth pointing out the last piece is dated March 2014 that s almost 2 years ago He hasn t done anything starcraft related in the last 2 years but goes ahead and shits on the sc2 community including fans and community figures All I want to see is just a show where Thorin and people from the sc2 community debate the WCS changes and possibly other related sc2 topics We do need different opinions we need Thorin It s just a shame that the last Unfiltered was so terribly and poorly handled
How big was the league of legends scene around the brood war era If you were esports commentator journalist you had to know about Starcraft around that time You make it seem that you had no financial gain behind doing all these interviews and you were doing all this out of passion Why didn t you just tell everyone goodbye or something instead of saying all this stuff
LoL was non existent in the BW era LoL took off because Blizzard was suing OGN and OGN don t want the hassle to fight the lawsuit so they ve decided to focus on LoL instead of StarCraft
I know that The question was kinda answered in the next sentence
Thorin is not the best journalist in starcraft but I read article of him Does that mean I don t like reading or journalism s thorin logic
EDGEY
Extremely long winded throughout his entire career
How is this relevant This was between 2012 and 2013 in what way does this speak about his knowledge of the scene since then
You don t need knowledge of the scene to think something is stupid Do I need to learn quantum theory to know that it s useless
IMO one of the biggest strengths and appeals of a show like Unfiltered is that you re able to have differing viewpoints and impassioned discussion I m sure Thorin and HuK would ve been able to handle themselves just go for it next time imo
Wholeheartedly agree with both points I have no problem with Richard Lewis or Thorin actually I regularly watch content from both of them but since they are friends and pretty much aligned on 99 of esports topics as far as I can tell we won t really hear as much of a discussion but rather 2 guys regurgitating each others points The biggest problem here is that the WCS story has good and legitimate arguments on both sides and those should be presented by people who believe in these arguments Thorin on the one side and HuK on the other Sad we couldn t see this discussion actually unfold
i dont see how this would end unfiltered Chanman realized the mistake that he made with the guest selection hes learned from it and will now know in the future to not make that mistake again I would like to see more unfiltered
From what he wrote I really dont think he much of a choice He was afraid Thorin would bail out like he did before
It was shitty episode but that s not a reason to stop the show at all
Maybe change the name to Filtered when they don t want discussions and oposing views
All of the threads on this subreddit about this have been so ridiculous and one sided it s hilarious that people are saying the same thing about the show as if it s instantly a bad thing You go into a show like Unfiltered knowing who the guests are and you expect something different Lets be real here In every show and piece of content I ve seen Thorin on he has had the same viewpoint He wants to see the best of the best fight it out That applies to CS GO Starcraft League of Legends everything I ve seen him talk about he has said the same thing If that isn t what you watch e sports for that s fine But that doesn t mean that it s a null and invalid point I personally can see the other side of the argument as well We want Starcraft 2 in the US to flourish Honestly I think it s a little late for that and I think Blizzard has squandered every chance they ve had to help it Even so this move could possibly help the North American scene So I could see both sides Having both sides of the argument can be valuable but Chanman made a choice on how he wanted the show to be and this particular segment didn t work out how he wanted it Oh fucking well That happens Grow the fuck up and move on There will be plenty more opportunities for both sides of this to have discussion The people on this subreddit aren t helping by trying to drive away those who discuss it
I just want to say that this is the best comment I have seen about this issue Moderate and reasonable
There s a difference between disagreeing with what someone is saying and having a relevant conversation and doing what a lot of people here did Circle jerking over hatred claiming people have no relevance to the scene and being a dismissive asshole over the points they made helps nobody especially yourself Feel free to complain but make sure you bring something relevant to the conversation and not just more hate
But in both LoL and CSGO the best of the best aren t at every tournament Not as sure about CSGO but LoL for sure LoL focuses entirely on regional competition where the teams meet later in the year just like Blizzcon Also both CSGO and LoL don t have one place that has 10 years of practice and strict training regime on everyone else Lastly LoL and CSGO are both team oriented games which focus less on mechanics and more on team synergy and team strategy execution This is the same reason a team like Greece can win the 2004 Euro against teams with way better players its because they happened to execute better as a team and have a better strategy TLDR CSGO and LoL are very different from SC competitively
You completely missed Thorins point nor was the original comment argeuing this point per se and more commenting on Chanman s decision making Regardless LoL and CS GO are very different competitively this doesnt change in any way that in all of those games Thorin has always said he wants best players to get the most money support instead of players of X region getting a disproportionate amount compared to their skill when it comes to designing competitive tournaments sponsors can do whatever Also your point about 10 years of infrastructure etc 1 How is this relevant This doesnt in any way change the fact that Koreans are better which remember Thorin openly says he only cares about getting the best competition skill wise 2 Actually you should learn about things before making comments about them CSGO has had a long history which is why in the EU there is that same type of infrastructure sort of like Korea has for SC This is why all the european teams are by far the best in CS GO Dont see anyone going to bat for the poor Koreans who dont have that infrastructure in CSGO Whats that all about Sry for bad englisch not my native language
Because Blizzard wants to grow SC2 as a global esport and they want to have leagues and competitions in every region with players that are not all Koreans and this is what they decided to do It doesn t have to make sense to you
The episode was bad IMO due to how one sided it was But the people who have suggested that the episode permanently damages the StarCraft 2 community are just being hyperbolic and wrong
The Starcraft community has been permanently damaged for a long long time
how can you damage something already ded
This is why the community is damaged
What is the point of lying Sc2 is close to dying
Nah It won t be some huge esport but blizz isn t going to abandon it
Oh you sweet summer child
Wait you actually think it s going to die soon lol
You know you re an idiot when people are agreeing with iBleeedorange over you
kek
Well I have to give Chanman props for being transparent about the whole thing Appreciate the write up hopefully this can be avoided next time cheers
exactly grown fucking men there was that part in the write up where Chan mentioned that Mr Lewis might walk away lol grow the fuck up people can get their points across while still remaining civil be a fucking adult and figure it out
The sad part in my opinion is that because this whole controversy has been completely overblown nobody is talking about the last hour of the episode which was extremely insightful and meant a hell of a lot more than the shit we re all hearing about
Change the title of the show if you are going to filter content for sensitive ears and big boy esports personalities that cant handle a simple discussion
Everyone and their mother could ve seen how one sided the show was going to be I m just disappointed that we didn t get a good episode of back and forth discussion rather than being mad over how much thoorin insults the sc2 scene
As one sided as the recent Remax just in the opposite direction
Well people where calling for someone like stuchiu being on the show during remax too
Not nearly as much as Unfiltered
remax is not nearly as relevant watched discussed ad unfiltered
Who on the recent Remax was supposed to be the dissenting voice again
Noone thats the problem
Which is precisely why we see it getting as much criticism as Unfiltered is nothing to do with the people views being more or less loved here
I for one fucking hate desrow
He deleted his tweet but the shit he said about MMA winning his last tournament HSC was disgusting That reprehensible slimeball is s pest

Love how theres no outrage about the wcs discussion where Desrow Morrow Nathanias and Rotterdam did exactly the same
This explains a lot Alright so why not do it all over again get HuK on there this time and do a WCS special
If he was so worried about Thorin talking shit to pretty much any guest then perhaps he shouldn t have been put on the show
I loved it Chanman has always kept a pretty open mic policy so if anyone wanted to join to clear something up could have just messaged him and get up there I hope they do if they couldn t at the time but shitting on on Chris for this is total BS this is the reason why we all loved and continue to love Unfiltered EDIT Just saw Chanman s post Too bad he was afraid to put HuK and Thorin together but there s something to learn from and do better next time
That s my biggest issue with chanman He plays it too safe including himself and how little he actually contributes to the discussions in terms of his own viewpoints Why not add his own fuel to the fire That s what a show is all about It s meant to be informative but also entertaining That s what draws viewers
Which is funny with the vote manipulation he did
I was gonna say But I didn t feel I should say it but you just came right out and said it for me
actually i like his safe attitude on the show He keeps things from turning in to 2 nerds going totally off the tracks with crazy rants He makes sure the show has an actual discussion topic and tries to stay impartial and just initiates the discussion highlights the viewpoints He simply just made a mistake by not having huk there It was a cruicial mistake but hopefully one he will learn from
But when he s had 2 guests going off topic or arguing with each other he s historically failed to moderate them and reign in the show every time That the show flows can be attributed to preparation setting out an agenda ahead of time and making sure the guests who are invited know what it is and will come prepared One of the problems with having Destiny on any show for example is that he just shows up and half asses everything and has no clue what s going on RL has always been ready to talk about the topic whatever it may be
Wut According to both chanman and huk huk wanted to come on and msged chanman during the show when thorin kept talking about huk as being the stereotypical lazy foreigner That and thorin not wanting destiny on the show so chanman asked him to stay out How is any of this an open mic policy Everyday im surprised ppl like you who just live in their own lalaland exist Sure chanman didnt see huks messages during the show but theres no real good reason in asking huk not to come on in the first place and if anything it makes it even scummier that chanman just watched as thorin kept dishing it out on huk when he as a host denied huk any chance to argue back
HuK had already made his points in his post As I said in my edit he should have had him and him trying to avoid a clash between the two on air was a mistake and he should have done better as a host Something to learn from and hopefully not repeat
https twitter com RLewisReports status 692779189934673920 https twitter com RLewisReports status 692778587120914432 so dramatic
fuck this guy is a cry baby honestly I m sure deep down inside he s not a complete fuckface but shit there s no clue of it when looking
One thing I don t understand is why you never coordinated with RL before the show He is your cohost right So why is he also repeating Thorins rant he literraly just repeated Thorins PC bang example even though it was completely irrelevant With him on the show as well it started to feel more like a 2v1 which is rarely productive
It s sad that Chanman had to make a decision based on the fact two adults couldn t be trusted to act like adults In retrospect it would have been better to skip the WCS topic since equal representation wasn t achievable
At least Huk didn t lie about how thorin didn t want him on the show OH wait
Did you see where Chanman said all hate on HuK is on Chanman or did you skip that part I m guessing you skipped that part
No that s Chanmans fault for not articulating well to Huk why he won t be on the show
Or maybe Huks fault because he made thorin look like an unreasonable asshole unsubstanciated
Both scenarios could be true or maybe it s not quite as black and white There s no point speculating though
or maybe its reddits fault for taking a quick tweet and interpreting it as a call to arms i dont get the whole lets use twitter to air out our dirty laundry thing Stop turning esports in to mtv
How can both scenarios be true when the guy who is responsible for the guests puts out a statement
Misunderstanding or miscommunication between Chanman and Huk It s possible Huk did just lie to make Thorin look bad but maybe he got the impression that Thorin didn t want him on the show based on the way Chanman communicated with him In Chanman s mind he told Huk the truth but maybe he didn t get his point across clearly or was too vague about the reasons Huk wasn t able to come on these don t seem out of character for him tbh and it left Huk with a false impression
Yeah you got a point Still an idiotic statement
Just like Destiny made Thorin say all those things about Poland that got him fired right Poor Thorin
Considering he wouldn t join a show with Destiny you can t really blame HuK
Where is the lying I see only bad communication no intentional lying
You didn t say anything which he didn t already He realizes the mistakes he made
What exactly is this based on Are you just saying that because you personally liked it I ve seen mostly backlash here and obviously that doesn t mean that the majority disliked it but I see nothing that indicates the majority enjoyed it And please don t bring up something retarded like the number of likes on the VOD
I mean you know the show not only gets watched by sc2 people The cs go thread looks completely different
Or maybe he can run the show however he damn well pleases and not bend to the will of Reddit autists
He can run the show however he wants it s his show I m just giving my opinion and suggesting what he can do better I m not a reddit autist I m a sc2 fan
Pretty sad that Chanman has to apologise for nothing Was a good show
Where didhe apologize He came out clarified some things and explained his thought process He didn t apologize and he didn t have to
This subreddit made ChanMan apologise for providing free entertainment Im done
Where did Chanman apologize Looks like all he did was clarify the situation and explain some things
This subreddit didn t like the episode so they explained why they disliked it What is with people saying this FREE ENTERTAINMENT line Please explain to me why something being free makes it immune to any kind of criticism
Oh fuck off It s the first episode and any content creator should be looking for areas to improve on Overall people are pretty understanding with ChanMan and majority are just saying it would have been a better episode with a variety of guests It s a legitimate concern and because it s being addressed the show can improve
In terms of improving the show and this is good that we talk about this to ultimately think on ways to make it even better and more viewers I think the biggest room for improvement lies squarely with Chanman I would like to see him go beyond just the host referee role I want to see him express more personal views Just say things and not be afraid and not lean so much on your guests to amp up the controversy Chanman needs to be more out there more expressive more risk taking
I m with you brother This subreddit is seriously fucking awful
Bye
Bye
Problem is Thorin even tried to insult Huk the whole episode like a stupid kid even though he was not allowed to be on the show That is what made me angry
Thorin didn t know Huk wasn t allowed to be on the show
That would be a very strange coincidence if he didn t know about that but used huk about 5 times as an example for a lazy foreigner But even if you are right it still does not make his insults better
But Huk is a great example of a lazy foreigner who bitches a bunch i literally cannot think of someone more stereotypical
Demuslim would be far better HuK actually goes to tournaments and I ve had no evidence to make me think he is lazy
Thorin being himself is why people are insulting him
If you insult a whole nation and then a whole scene then yeah you might get some people that will insult you back
You really that offended
I don t go on crazy twitter rants and stream rants so the question is Thorin that offended
this chanman guy needs to have some backbone if he can t control two guests on his own show then he shouldnt host he was essentially afraid of thorin v huk acting like kids and personally attacking each other a good host would stamp shit like that out real quick if it started but wouldnt shy away from bringing opposite viewpoints
I mean If he didn t think thorin and huk could have a reasonable discussion then dump thorin out of that segment so it would be RL and huk so you could actually have both sides of the debate and if that wasn t doable the WCS segment should of been dropped completely Zero reason having a discussion on it without both sides
Quite funny that Richard and Thorin constantly praised SC2 for their community And here we are us shitting on them for no reason cause we are so far off being relevant so we fabricate hatred and mob mentality Fucking disgusting
if I disagree with criticism then there s no reason for it
Richard Lewis and thorin were smearing people without them being able to defend themselves on the talk show It was rather pathetic and only wanted people to feel bad for them If those other people were on the show let em at it But it s two people shitting on the community really classy show
So criticizing the actions of people you need to tell the people directly No that is not something that would happen in any other area of life If these people want to defend themselves there s several platforms for them to do so
He used to praise the sc2 community because all the other ones had already been sick of his shit and kicked him out already Sc2 basically won by default
Complete and utter bullshit Nice ad hominem
its the mentality people have to not want to hear the truth
Richard spent most of the segment nodding his head and drinking from the bottle It was Thorin who essentially called blizzard and the sc2 scene racist for attempting region locking to promote esports outside of Korea Ironic since Thorin himself was fired over xenophobic comments before Overcompensating much Thorin This isn t fabricated hatred or mob mentality Every action has a reaction and when you shit on an entire country or scene expect a reaction
What happened on the episode Whats the controversy
25 30 yo people acting like 13 years old on a playground
Nothing to stop the next episode providing different guests and a different side of the argument is there You don t necessarily need two different viewpoints to be yelling at each other on the same show if you don t think they can have a civilised discussion together Some of the louder talkers just tend to talk over other people that doesn t mean their viewpoints are wrong it just means some types of guest won t work well on the same episode as others as you can t always get the best discussion out of each guest that you want
the episode was good the community was just retarded
Here s the problem with this sub Everyone has complained about the show to no end but I haven t seen a single person even attempt to bring up the other side of the debate Could the show have been better with Huk on Quite possibly Did Thorin and Richard do a good job of presenting and explaining their views without him Absolutely If you really disagree with the message explain why break down their views and point out specific instances where you disagree Don t just sit here and bitch and moan
Good show but does nobody see the irony in a program named Unfiltered filtering which guests can cannot be on together If the guests have differences of opinion or simply don t like each other and it devolves into trading personal insults or feelings being hurt then so be it These are adults and if that s how they wish to conduct themselves then that is their prerogative I d rather see these guests engage in debate argument and risk some sort of personal fallout than to not see them engage one another at all and never really get to the meat of the issues edit Spelling
Oh yeah I m sure he prevented HuK or DESTINY from being on Unfiltered so that it didn t have 10k guests No Destiny you can t be on this part of Unfiltered the show you ve been on for several years because then we run the risk of having way too many guests
Obviously My point was that the guests were selected or not selected due to the way they might interact with one another If the show were truly unfiltered one would imagine that it would directly address controversial topics
The point is and the point that Richard Lewis and Thorin both fail to understand largely because they are both stupid is that Foreigners will NEVER be better if Koreans are free to enter any tournament they want and win it the motivation etc just isn t there You wouldn t have Day9 and tasteless traveling to tournaments because they would KNOW before they left that there was ZERO chance of winning they had to play their hearts out to beat other foreigners and I m sure we ve all watched Daily 100 Besides what was the point of having ZERO SC2 representation and then having a discussion about sc2 I d have LOVED to have seen Huk give it to Thorin Thorin would have lost the argument because see above and would have left the show to go cry in a corner
cant understand what Chanman was thinking TalkShow 101 is to have both sides of a topic represented on a show Why on earth he didnt do that why he d cowtow to 1 guests whims idk It just seems unprofessional misguided he couldve avoided this whole mess just by doing a better job
Yeah clearly the only who can lie in this situation is Chanman
you are going to blindly believe huk One of the biggest whiners twitter warrior lazy foreigners in the scene
Yup my comment totally wasn t sarcasm aimed at this subs way of thinking
What do you think Always fun to have a reality check on people in a sub and see if they can spot sarcasm when it hits them right in the face
It s not the sub being bad at spotting sarcasm you re just really terrible at sarcasm I really disliked this episode of Unfiltered HAHAHAHAHA YOU IDIOTS COULDN T TELL THAT COMMENT WAS SARCASTIC That was basically the quality of your sarcasm
Thanks for proving me right Your post made absolute zero sense First saying that I m terrible at sarcasm to then post an example that isn t even sarcasm Which one is it
It was just an example of sarcasm that was equivalent to yours My post was such a bad use of sarcasm that it doesn t at all seem like I was sarcastic That s exactly what your post was like It s possible that Chanman was lieing it s possible that Huk was lieing and it s possible that there was just a misunderstanding All you did was say Why is Chanman lieing followed by YOU IDIOTS DIDN T REALIZE I WAS SARCASTIC The reason nobody realized you were sarcastic isn t because we re all terrible at identifying sarcasm it s just because you re absolute shit at being sarcastic
Go and get a basic understatement of sarcasm and come back Because if you re going to cling on that your example contained sarcasm you quite obviously don t understand it This isn t some next level shit
The irony
Ah fuck I get it you re just baiting me You got me
I guess just accusing anyone who disagrees with you of baiting you is a decent way to get out of any argument without admitting that you re retarded Nah dawg the huge group of people telling you that your shit at sarcasm are either idiots or baiting Everyone is stupid except for you
the show was amazing it s not a debate show It s unfiltered where you hear the guest s opinions and chanman moderates the conversation If you don t like the guests don t watch it It s simple
Unfiltered without RL will be boring I hope he changes his mind
He always talked highly of this community in particular Regardless of his views I have to imagine the backlash was pretty upsetting Huge blow to the show and I hope he reconsiders
Agreed The amount of value he brought to the show is impossible to overstate really hope he decides to come back after all
Shame on this community for the hate he got
I don t entirely think it was the community s fault Part of being a public figure is to take criticism and just shrug it off Destiny Lycan Rifkin and other esport players got bashed on at one point or another When you make a big statement to a community its kind of expected that there will be some backlash from that community He s gotten bigger hate from dota2 when that whole Loda conflict happened I really respect him as a journalist and I thought that at some point in his career he developed a thicker skin to these kind of attacks from communities I think he s just overreacting
The community has also praised him It is part of talking openly about polarizing subjects He didn t need to quit over it It is like you being mad at the community because some people expressed their opinion No one asked him to quit He chose that
Dude shame on him for being that thin of skin Flame wars happen all the time its the internet Dude shouldn t be so sensitive People were angry it was a one way discussion anyway not that RL did anything overtly wrong
Shame thorin insulted the whole community out of the blue richard lewis had a choice to make I like him but he clearly showed that he wasn t going to say anything to even temper thorin agressive stance toward people who enjoy sc2 differently than him which made for a poor discussion
What happened anyway
The show yesterday was not a debate perse because it consisted purely of Richard and Thorin shouting and screaming and monolouging their shared opinions on the WCS changes and other things Obviously people who are used to tuning in for discussions about these topics that consist of a few different people with separate views complained and now because Richard is completely incapable of handling criticism he s leaving the show tldr Richard Lewis is and always will be a massive fucking baby EDIT Man these votes are a real tidal wave
The idea that you think unfiltered is a balanced debate show is hilarious
Funny how there wasn t this same outrage for another show with the opposing viewpoint This sub is filled with hypocrites and retarded children
The WCS part was mostly Thorin and Chanman And I don t think it has anything to do with not handling criticism why the fuck would he want to voice his opinions on a show if all he gets is shit like this in return
Reminder that you have no fucking clue what you re talking about making judgements about someone without actually knowing the full story at the very least
Did his fists come out this time
Its a conspiracy against him maaaan The Christ like Richard Lewis and Thorin are being victimized by a vast conspiracy against them
He never once called it a conspiracy But he did expose Slasher and others for trying to ruin their work relationships You want to know why Slasher is quiet Hmm maybe he has nothing to say Like he doesn t want to refute it and blatantly lie in case of evidence being shown If he has nothing to worry about he d come out and say that RL and Thooorin are lying
i like richard lewis but frankly i think he s got the biggest victim complex in the whole world which is funny because he works at breibart and they re always going on about victim culture i think him and thorin get off on people hating them because it enforces there EVERYONE IS AGAINST ME US BECAUSE WE RE SO REAL
If you watched that Unfiltered episode surely you would have noted a myriad of reasons explaining why they might feel victimized And those were just cases which they chose to publicly comment on Railing against non exaggerated adversity isn t a victim complex
i think alot of it IS exaggerated though and although i don t know as much about thorin for the decent amount of time i ve followed richard almost everytime he talks about anything he has to bring it back to how everyones out to get him

this whole thing blew up ridiculously in typical r starcraft and RL fashion edit i already watched the segment and RL didn t do anything wrong lol i don t know why he s leaving
Because SC2 community is most of the time a joke when discussing about SC2 topics
deleted
no one was forced it s his decision
The backlash was against the show format just him and Thorin with no counterpoint except chanman who is easily talked over and against things that Thorin said Nothing much was aimed at him nobody called for him to leave stand down throw a hissy fit 2 people who don t have much to do with sc2 decided to trash talk the whole community We had a go at them back they washed their hands of it doing exactly what Slasher does Them you re racist cunts us maybe have a sensible discussion about it before saying inflammatory things This is a circlejerking shitshow atm them can we all just play nicely
Thorin you guys don t want there to be high level sc2 you re not real fans Does that not classify as trash talk I want there to be more high level sc2 that s why we need a foreign scene If there wasn t one then it d be like Brood War only in Korea except people in Korea don t like sc2 as much as BW so it ll die pretty quickly
No it doesn t and it s insane to take offense to something like that to the degree people did It s even a good point that attacks an argument very frequently brought up in these discussions It could have been presented in a less inflammatory way but it hardly warranted this kind of reaction
The foreign players aren t pushing the korean players to be better for the foreign players to become better they need to compete against the koreans The best way to improve the foreign scene would be to have korean players play the NA and EU ladders not blocking them from facing off completely There is a saying If you are the strongest person in your gym you need to find a new gym And that goes from just about anything competitive I support what TB has said earlier The best way to improve the NA scene is to put money at the GM ladder That will make the best players play the ladder even some Koreans and hence improve the quality of everyone practice
There could ve been as much money for the foreigners this year as it was last year if they continued with the same format Not just the ones that live in NA or EU but everyone If they put down 10000 a month for a tournament for top 16 32 for the NA and EU ladders that could bring koreans over to compete on those ladders even if they did get bad ping When did Thorin say that he disagrees with this If anything he wants the foreigners to compete with the Koreans and yes the current system is shit As long as the foreigners aren t actively competing with the koreans they will just fall further and further behind
Thorin never said that it comes purely from your imagination Now imagine if you had retards like yourself misrepresenting your views and crying about what you hadn t even said 24 7 That s why Richard is leaving and as much as it sucks to lose one of the few honest voices in the scene I don t blame him one bit

No I didn t His tweets say what I said in my previous comment
removed
I have to admit I am only passing here because of the show and the reaction on twitter Don t know shit about SC2 So I came here not to comment on WCS but to comment on the reaction Shouldn t the SC2 community give said sensible discussion they wanted to have in episode instead of attacking Thorin Richard and Chanman I have seen counterpoints to Thorin position in the thread regarding the episode but those are far and far between all the shit talking
We tried but would he listen No he wouldn t His own interview with Camac illustrates most of our points but he didn t understand Carmac then and he doesn t understand any of us now Thorin called us all racist cunts during a show where we can t argue with him or on a medium where we can t say things properly It s easy to say you re racist on twitter it s a lot harder to explain why we need a foreign scene in 140 characters At the end of the day 2 people who haven t been involved in the scene heavily for the last 2 3 years came along and talked shit railroaded the host of the show and then ignored all the people trying to argue with them There s nothing we can do at this point
You are purposively focusing on the more polarizing comments I guess it is understanble has they get more of a reaction but you shouldn t look at it by being a direct attack at you or the community Also he didn t directly say that SC2 community is racist rather that the measure gives that impression which it has some true in it it is singling out a group of people I don t value and don t think there is any value in arguing if the show is fair or not There are sensible ways to give feedback on the issue not this personal attacks on the guest and hosts Unfiltred isn t a show purposely made for discussion The last episodes with Chanman Richard and Destiny have all been one sided in some topics but people didn t complain then why now Also don t understant why people also attack Richard he barely talked about this topic It was mostly Thorin and he knows about the scene
Im gonna sound either stupid or smart but i have seen this and he thoorin said something that can be argued with mm maybe i should send a twitter to him uh not enough space well change the twitt to fck you Reddit is here for a reason some of you could have taken 2 hours made a full statement or counter argument and do a reddit post then discuss from there but nope The community decided twitter was the best option cuz it gives you direct acces to him You guys decided that the discusion was to be made around them and not around their points or discusion On the other hand idk if they are involved that much in SC2 but giving the outside point of view doesnt make it Shit talking nor anything like that it just and outsider perspective and you should take it like that and think why are they getting that impresion English is not my first language and i refuse to take resposibility on any typos i made

not really I s not racist to say that there has to be competition outside Korea for sc2 to survive It s not because of Faceless Koreans it s mainly down to timezones sc2 cannot and will not survive on Vods alone If the system was exactly the same only with no region lock on DH IEMs i e 2015 but without wcs then most foreigners would retire within the year the rest the next year Because if you don t win money and don t have much of a salary then you need to get a job get a job and you have to play less so have even less chance of winning any money If there are no foreigners then there will be no events outside Korea because they will be pointless and needlessly expensive If sc2 is only played professionally in Korea viewership will be shit so everyone will go back to games they want to play Half back to BW the rest to try and do something else maybe start up DoTA properly in Korea or something similar
I don t know shit about SC2 so I will have to ask some things that I know come from ignorance Isn t one of the reasons SC2 is lacking viewership because there is lack of players overall The reason SC2 isn t as big as BW in Korean isn t because of LoL popularity They made this point in the show that by region locking Koreans you are also afecting the Korean players lives as the tournaments in the West were a source of money for them
Is the western scene the answer for the SC2 to raise in popularity Are the changes in WCS to give a new life in SC2 or is it to stabalize its popularity Or even worse stop the bleeding which will only lead to a slow death
Well let us see the results in the next years I hope SC2 gets a new life
wait wait wait what was racist I mean its 99 white guys over here and two white guys overthere Is it because thorins english or something
Koreans vs foreigners mostly
He said we all hate Koreans because they are Koreans He called us racist many times
i havent watched the show yet but if thats the way he wants to be than he can piss off peace out There wasnt much that he added to starcraft anyways no big loss imo
Richard pls don t go T T
I was so excited when the show came back Now I m sad again I don t want unfiltered with just Steven and Chris or whoever third they bring Richard was perfect in this trio Please Richard if you re reading this don t go
Incidentally bring Cody Connors back or rito
Yeah a employee of Twitch that will never go on Unfiltered just for that reason He can t even talk about most things anymore We ruined another thing related to SC2 we re the best at pushing people out
But why RL has always been frank and there was nothing problematic in his part People just wanted a 2 sided discussion and that is about the guest selection Come on he is better than this to be swayed by anonymus public hate
Lets face it mate people don t want a 2 sided discussion if Richard and Thoorin sat on the other side of this debate there would be 0 drama
I want it i cant speak for everyone but considering how everything went south they did wanted a discussion
Its possible but I think it has a lot more with people being upset their opinions weren t represented more than anything else Unfiltered has honestly very rarely had even keeled debate of any kind its really not what the show is about the show is about honest uncomfortable opinions of the hosts and the guests and I feel like we got that no problem
Honest opinions are interesting if they collide
This seems like the most childish move he could have possibly made When Richard started coming on Unfiltered I liked him quite a lot as I didn t know him from anywhere else and his roots in CS struck a cord with me as I was into that long before I knew of esports or anything But over the shows time he became more and more dominant to the point where it was almost his own vehicle it made perfect sense for Chanman to split it up but to then walk away from it because the first show had a problem that could very easily be fixed for next time seems so petulant
He might be doing work for the turner league in the near future so that means he can t be doing shows like this anymore etc for obvious reasons It might be that this backlash isn t the only reason he ll stop doing it
he never exactly had thick skin its probably for the best if he gets this stressed out about it
More that he actually had stuff to contribute to the topics being covered in the show Its the direction chanman wanted with the show i would say that richard being on his game all of the time and ready to talk about it probably encouraged chanman to continue to go down that angle as time went on though And lets face it there are limits to bullshit and im sure theres way more stuff going on out of the public eye
I watch Richard s YouTube channel on occasion He s a good guy But this reeks of a classic case of dishing it out but unable to take it Richard where did the bad twitter people touch you Go to your safe space brother
You know I have watched Unfiltered the whole week up until episode 66 I believe and he talked about why hes so aggressive on twitter and it basically comes down to that all the good messages on twitter for example fly right pass him but the one hate message sticks with him Here is the segment if your interested I think he explains it the best
This isn t unique of him In general people react this way to bad comments they stick the most
Yeah yeah keep spinning that narrative
Didn t happen would love to see the evidence though mate
I hope that he changes his mind It s always interesting to hear his viewpoint on things even if I don t always agree with them A lot of the time the viewpoints you don t agree with are a lot more valuable than the ones you do It s pretty fucking unhealthy living in an echo chamber where everyone just repeats your own ideas back to you I think it would be good for Chanman and Richard Lewis to realize that a show like Unfiltered is going to have a bit of lashback just by the nature of putting out opinions and not being a sugar coated bullshit fest
without him or thorin the show has almost no value destiny is always uninformed and relatively stupid on most topics and there is no one else to fill the void
There s no pleasing someone people And it seems some people think they are entitled to someone giving them free entertainment Richard Lewis doesn t get paid for appearing on the show and it s completely his prerogative on whether he appears or not If you think otherwise they you just come across as entitled and childish
Honestly I m not a huge fan of Steven but I watched Unfiltered because of the debate that happened between Richard and him They often had very different views and would debate them thoroughly allowing me to get insights from both sides Chris also makes for a really good third Will be a shame if Richard is not there anymore I will watch at least a few shows after the change but I just don t think it will be nearly as good
Goodjob SC2 community now Unfiltered can be what it started a unwatched show with Destiny whining about balance to a wall for two hours
Why is he leaving
What did he say that pissed off the SC community Ive watched whole VOD and I genuinely don t know what he said that was so bad
Wow how pathetic
I honestly have nothing against him or thorin and I think they are great at what they do but the martyr complex they have is just fucking ridiculous They honestly think that everything and everyone is conspiring against them
Agreed I respect their opinions highly on several subjects but the way they re acting right now is pathetic
deleted
Not just that but he s leaving because we supposedly asked for it he said he was gonna give the circlejerk what they wanted in another tweet I don t recall anyone asking for Richard to be booted from the show because of their statements I might be biased in what I remember seeing but I only remember seeing praise for the video or criticism for not having someone with the opposite viewpoint on to counter their circlejerk To me he s just acting like a child right now
Hilarious to see people bash him Go on Hop in to his shoes and think how fun it is that people always are crying to him and his opinions because they can t handle for example the truth that WCS is idiotic from Korean s point of view It is not a huge surprise if all the bashing is the reason why he is quitting No one won t take that shit for the rest of their life
https www youtube com watch v sXQkXXBqj U
don t leave bae
It s weird how the show was immensely appreciated by Counter Strike community and a majority of the show was about exposing the shady things that happens behind the curtains of Esports Almost like SC2 community banded together to ostracize the people that even mentions SC2
Good he ll have more time to work on Lewis Bonnell then
Why though
Thanks to all the loud and vociferous voices in Starcraft This is why we can t have interesting things And its like a free fucking show even
Shame I think there were a lot of good arguments both in the topic and of those for and against the particular episode I get why he s pissed and hope it works out for him cuz I like him as a journalist and dude I don t agree with how he s handling this but I understand it Good luck to him That said this seems like the beginning of the end of unfiltered And I imagine this next episode might actually end up being truly unfiltered
Such a victim I weep for him
No idea who Richard Lewis is See ya
Good He is an ignorant bully
Goodjob SC2 community we successfully ended the best Esport show we ve had We have really accomplished something now I mean it was all over the pettiest bullshit but who cares we successfully pitchforked again like the old days I mean SC2 will be a better place without Unfiltered anyways cause 2016 is our year and talent are blooming and we need to remove these polarizing figures cause they taint the purity of SC2 Wooooo s
You realise people were upset about a 1 sided discussion and apart from the vocal minority that you ll find in literally every public forum didn t really say shit about RL No one chased them out of the scene RL leaving is an overreaction about a pretty basic issue
Why does this guy even matter
He has done a lot of work more than anybody else exposing shady shit going on in the esports scene as a whole like orgs fucking over their players etc I d say that s pretty important work but perhaps you re fine with such practices
That doesn t give him the right to act like the spoiled brat he seems to be most of the time A douchebag is a douchebag even if his work is good Maybe he should stick to expose the dark sites of esports rather than to tell anyone his opinion on everything like it is a fact and insult anyone disagreeing with him
No but just because you don t like him as a person doesn t mean he s worthless or meaningless when it s the opposite for any scene he s involved in I don t get along with people like him either but I can still appreciate his value as a no nonsense journalist
He certainly has an audiance People do care about his opinions that is why he has a patreon set up as well as Unfiltred all expecting Richard to give his opinions on the matter As a matter of fact he has long experience in esports and knows things behind the scenes that does give him some credibility right And if you were to hear opinions of someone in esports he should be the one to hear maybe not on SC2 as in fact he didn t argue much on that topic
Because he is one of the very few persons that are actually giving a shit and tell his audience the truth
he doesn t lol
Its so stupid Leaving a show because of how the community rightfully responded to something is just so childish You dont have to leave it just don t make the same mistake again
So change who you are to conform to how I want you to be and then I will accept you Yeah sounds like a good ideology to go out into the world with
It s more like Don t act like youre the victim when you made a mistake
What mistake did he make
Talking about something he has no clue I don t hate RL I think he s a good journalist this wasn t a smart move from him
If you are talking about the WCS stuff he didn t really say all that much but he seemed to see the truth as opposed to a bunch of other people that are in denial
Yeah how dare he express an opinion contrary to yours on the subject what a mistake
Wow what happened between the show s end and today Does he not love Destiny anymore
I didn t realize the hate was being shaded in Richards direction Thought it was mostly against Thorin
Wait a minute were we watching Unfiltered again I thought that they dropped Sc2 mostly
deleted
psst we dont talk about this here only winter is the bad guy
Destiny fangays did it idiots
Leaving a talkshow UNFILTERED about a subject that s rather heavily influenced by opinion seems rather childish to me Everyone s entitled to their opinion but throwing in the towel after people being vocal about the opposing side of said subject isn t necessary at all The show has ALWAYS been about banter has ALWAYS had back and forth arguments What s so special about this that would require RL to even consider leaving the show for Personally I see it as weakness from RL as a journalist to back off from a show based on arguments different viewpoints So what if your opinion is different from anyone else s Stand by it don t be a pussy and keep doing what you re doing You gotta take the good with the bad as any sane person on Twitter and other social media has to understand
Gotta love opinions from people calling you a cunt and telling you how clueless you are about the scene without laying out any properly formed arguments
Yep people here make it sound like people are having intelligent discussion with richard thorin explaining their point of view when in reality its just a shit ton of abuse
Right but RL has been called names before My point was that especially on social media stuff like that shouldn t phase you as much More so because he s been in the business for so long
This alone wasnt the problem it was just the tipping point
Does this mean that the show will no longer be split into two or will chanman try to find another cohost for the esports weeks
It s incredible how Lewis and Thorin continue to hover around esports with their weird self pitying attitudes I have never known any legit journalist to behave with such lack of professionalism to demand such constant and unearned reverence from the public and to cave into childish self pity whenever they encounter any kind pushback
I assume that with hovering around esport you mean creating important and interesting content
Thooorin in particular highlights a lot of important issues around the scene I often disagree with his viewpoints because I feel he has a somewhat binary way of looking at things but to say he s not done important and interesting content is being disingenuous Just recently he helped highlight the player salary issues in the LoL scene he s brought together other knowledgeable voices in the scene Bryce Blum to discuss player contracts the new rise of VC growth player contracts etc I m not a huge fan of Thorin s public persona but the content is an inarguable benefit
You re joking right So stuff like MYM and IBuyPower were non stories And alienating developers Valve actually acted on his information And being on Riots bad side is not something to be ashamed of Just look at the MYM incident They are both among the very best at what they do within esport
Apparently I m blocked on Twitter So I ll say it here No one cares You re a reporter Do your job and stop having a big head Enjoy not discussing an interesting game Stop reading every darn thing on reddit
Think I figured out why he blocked you on twitter
well he failed as co host so not so surprising
Alive gaem Daed show
I don t give a fuck on this guy If u hate him stop to promote him
He can dish it but he cant take it Cry me a fucking river bitch
Thorin didn t allow him to do it anymore I bet
Can i be unbanned now
Dude have you ever watched unfiltered The whole point of the show is that people are supposed to just be real and say what they think even if its the uncomfortable truth thats the point of the show not to debate recent news topics
I don t even know this guy or show anyway x
Can someone tell me who the fuck Richard Lewis is and what he has been doing for with starcraft2 I ve been following the scene since beta and haven t heard of this guy ever lol
There were a bunch of people scamming the StarCraft community and he exposed them I think that s bigger contribution than 99 of StarCraft fans
1st 14 990 2nd 10 Now this is my kind of tournaments D
THB they can afford to be a bit more top heavy
Get Fantasy on it too plz
Why the downvotes people
Brood War often gets a weird reaction on this subreddit really
swear there s more that get insecure when it s mentioned than actual elitists on here
People forget it s r starcraft meaning both games First rule of r starcraft Talk about how superior Brood War is without actually playing it
I ll be honest Broodwar is a ruthless game to actually play If you think SC2 is difficult Broodwar is on a completely new level Master s league in SC2 is like a D rating on iCCup If you play hours a day for several years you re lucky to make C rating I love watching Broodwar and as long as the Broodwar scene is alive I will definitely want to watch it But playing it is not for me
I know how difficult BW is Took me 6 7 months to get C I did play like 5 hours a day minimum Then sc2 came out P Wish I had gotten into BW back in 07 or 08 rather then 09
I m C on Fish and I can beat A players on iCCup I understand very well how difficult Brood War is Meh people fight too much I don t play BW because it s superior or better I play it because I fucking feel like it I play both games frequently and at a high level In 2016 it s amazing to see that Brood War is actually growing in Korea Tournaments are popping up online and viewership is growing Oh and the key to Brood War is to not take it seriously If you learn some Korean and play Fish you ll definitely lose at least 100 games before winning a single one but trust me when I say it s worth it BW is a pain to control for new players but once you get used to it the game is much more laid back than SC2 You aren t forced into a single composition and you have some wiggle room The only all in I can think of is the muta ball of death T T
Okay so muta balls aren t the only all in of course but the only all in I struggle with is the muta ball of everything that is evil and it s pretty standard on Fish Mutas are pretty strong if you don t shut that ball down and the game can turn into just killing them
How populated is the Fish server I e wanted to push up BW again but I remember it being hard to find a game on iCCup for a while
As long as you re not on when it s super early in Korea there will be at least 10 000 people online Log in on a Saturday night Korean time and there can be as many as 30 000 people on at once It s currently 6 30 AM on a Friday everybody is either in school asleep or working and there are 2 000 people on That s about the lowest it ever gets Highest I ve ever seen it is 60 000 and that was after NaDa s wedding ceremony and the LotV Korean launch
It s difficult for all the wrong reasons I prefer sc2
I dunno I was way better at BW than I could imagine being at SC2 But I m also old
Sounds almost like r starcraft talking about SCII without actually playing it
it s pretty funny i bet the average hours of bw played in the last 5 years of this subreddit is under 10 hours and that s being generous
Because SC2 fans blame BW for SC2 s decline instead of David Kim
I wonder if you actually believe this
WHAT
Would be nice to get Nal rA too
as a caster right he ll just lose if he plays and its not like hes on afreeca so he won t even get balloons for just playing either
Who is funding this
Terror the Afreeca streamer who makes over 20 000 per month out of viewer donations from pouring soy sauce on children
I hope the sauce is at least gluten free
Wow i didn t know that yelling guy made that much of money lol
Terr0r hes a bw streamer he has a couple of sponsors that s mostly all we have translated
He s also clinically insane according to about 99 of the world
He should start an esports team
The Screaming BJs
Invade Russia in winter Esports
He s the fella that smeared feces all over the wall while screaming yeah
Yep
seems like he chose his nickname wisely
Terror s tournaments are simply amazing I can t wait
Whaaat Awesome Please come play FlaSh
Hodo 1
God himself returns
Flash for sure wouldn t win he s out of practice
We talked about the last time he was on TLG during Gfinity and made peace He is always welcome on along with any other community figure especially to discuss a topic as important as this
Make special episode of TLG called WCS debate and make it similar to debates in America so everyone would have to say what they wand and we see all sides of the stories not just a yelling fest and Thorin rage quitting again when he overloads Just make sure that he you have guests that can argue with Thorin Incontrol Destiny Huk Harstem unlike Chanman i love him but he can t argue for his points and equal representative for both sides of the argument
I like this idea
Yeah and be prepared to moderate a lot because Thorin is very aggressive allow time for each guess to speak without being interrupt all the time by Duncan See how the manV was feeling in the show I felt sad for him Oh yeah and something something DingIt
To be fair moderating that would be extremely easy Give them x minutes then mute them Wish they could do that inn all debates
Go for it m8
I also have a present for you I will send it latter privately
No dick pics pls
Well you ruined 2nd part of the gift
1 for it Would be awesome
pretty late for that the outcome won t change the system either way but i think it would be good to have a discussion about it anyway good for wcs moving forward
Don t overload it with pro WCSers though or else it becomes a circle jerk and not a debate
I would actually love to see such a show Go for it Lycan
thorin wont do this
Yeah I doubt the show happens Richard and Duncan have been big shots on twitter all day but they re dodging people asking questions about him being on Lycan s show and focusing on the idiots instead They re all talk atm and probably will stay that way
idk they debate people in their other games communities all the time
Yeah but they re aggressively pulling out of their sc2 related content Richard Lewis leaving over something like people wanting a balanced discussion is just pathetic They just saw this as a great way to tell the Old Boys Club to shove it and they took it
Seems like a lot of people for 1 man to debate against
I meant that we have equal represented debate Example RL Thoorin vs Destiny Huk Not whole SC2 community vs Thoorin
Why would we have destiny in the debate though I feel like he is out of place in this topic

deleted
dont forget discussing defending dingit
Yeah but you cant have Destiny on the show then Thorin wont do a show with him there
oh boy https twitter com Thooorin status 692725068003176448
lol he thinks the entire world is conspiring against him I mean for fucks sake just a take a look at your own tweet history and see if you are capable of having a no flame meaningful discussion about anything
And Thorin very clearly said that Huk is lying It s Thorin s word against Huk s we don t know which one is lying At least not before Chanman writes up his piece that he tweeted about
Neither is lying It s incredibly clear what happened from Chanman s Q A after unfiltered For whatever reason which is still uncertain Chanman didn t want Destiny and Thorin on the same show Partly because Destiny would be bored out of his mind on esports partly because he didn t want either of them rage quitting the show So as long as Chanman is trying to make a safer space for Thorin to discuss himself probably feeling a bit guilty about the effect on his job the last time he wanted to make sure that anyone with a bad relationship with Thorin wasn t really there Turns out that Chanman got the perception and let s be honest with how Thorin talked about HuK Chanman was probably right that Thorin and HuK didn t get along So without Thorin realizing Chanman decided not to let HuK on to make it a safer space
I think you missed the Twitter war between Thorin and Destiny tl dr insults were thrown and joint appearances scrapped
See here s the thing with Thorin If when Thorin conducts a 1 on 1 interview with someone eg Naniwa he comes across as pleasantly spoken professional and dare I say even enjoyable to watch But in a situation where he s in a position where someone is egging him or provoking him he reacts poorly And Twitter is a total gong show when he s on seemingly a completely different person emerges It sounds more to me that when it s a controlled environment where he has his agenda and topics all lined up in a well structured format this is where he excels But when things are off the cuff no holds barred format then things go to hell very quickly He is one of those people who would benefit from keeping some of his opinions to himself and I m sure he knows this But sometimes social media is too convenient and just there and easily abused when a person don t stop to think on the ramifications of their actions before hitting the Post key
And that s his fault If you can t fathom that your social media reflects who you are as a person you shouldn t use it
I think another one was that Chanman didn t feel like the esports discussions included Destiny as much as he Chanman wanted and Destiny was just sitting there nodding his head but its not like Destiny doesn t appear on other shows too
Did you even read my post
oh dear didnt see that both comments came from you D
Turns out HuK wasn t allowed on the show Chanman told HuK he wasn t allowed on but not because of Thorin s demands Sounds like miscommunication
I am a tortoise Pshyche I am not actually a tortoise It s pretty easy to say whatever you want in a reddit thread Also afterwards it s easy to claim in public that you were willing to participate especially if you re the first person who gets to present their narrative Always get your blows in first when you re flinging mud on the Internet Jokes aside I didn t say Huk lied I was trying to point out that we don t know what happened so it s pointless to try and act as judge and jury Also by now it s pretty clear that no one lied per se it was a more a miscommunication
It would be a stupid thing to lie about on Huk s part It s not like Huk was in a position where he already looked bad and wanted to save face If the opposite was true it would be easier to take Thorin s claim seriously because there would be a clearly established motive Also Huk is pretty far from being a timid guy that evades any potential confrontations in fact he s pretty much the opposite of that Just my 2 cents EDIT To clarify he does indeed have a motive to defend the new WCS system However there s no clear motive to lie about an invitation in this case especially concerning an individual that does not shy away from confrontation Usually when people lie about something like this it s to save face after a host says something like well we invited an opposing opinion Huk to the debate but they declined the invitation Now I can t prove that he s not lying but I do believe that one scenario is more likely than the other and I presented why I believe so
Yea sure it would be a stupid thing for huK to lie to make someone who he doesn t like look bad when hes rising good points about flaws in wcs system HuK literally has tons to gain from saying this
You re missing the point He could have easily criticized the shit out of it either way on Reddit on stream wherever no contest That s not what this argument is about The central claim is that he was invited to the show but in the end was uninvited despite wanting to participate We had no idea he was invited to begin with before he posted thus there was no motive to save face in this manner Huk did not need an excuse because he was NOT put in a position where he needed one On the other hand Thorin clearly had a strong motive to save face since the claim was that his involvement somehow interfered with Huk s invitation Now if Huk was either 1 not invited or 2 declined invitation Chanman could have easily settled this in his response Yet Chanman s statement on the matter made it clear that neither case 1 or 2 is true But even if he hadn t cleared this up it s pretty easy to predict the most likely scenario in this case
The central claim was that Thoorin didnt want him on the show which every other person involved is denying So hes coming out to get people on his side and stick it to someone he doesn t like
We will see if HuK backs his statement up Im pretty sure Thoorin thinks that HuK doesnt want to be on a show with him and is just saying that to try and defend sc2 and a time where he can be relevant again
No he was turned down by Chanmans concerns Chanman is the host and should have had Huk on Thorin then could have walked or stayed on the show Chanman is and always has been a massive passive pussy
Thorin wants any revenue from that discussion for himself If it were done on Unfiltered he d walk away with nothing He knows if he did a show with Rotti Huk etc it would worth some money for him
What You think he wouldn t be better of making ANY other content than SC2 related stuff Look at the views he gets on his youtube channel He does not need the couple of thousand views he would get from making that kind of show e I mean I m sure he wouldn t mind making even that small amount of money all I m saying is that if he would only be after money he wouldn t have even gone on Unfiltered
The idea that the Starcraft 2 community is a good place for someone who has been doing this for over 10 years to get in a quick cash grab is pretty damn insulting and just dumb If he wanted cash he could easily make way more on content from any other scene
did you even read the post Chanman said he told Huk that thorin was going to be on the show and huk said that he doesn t have a very good relation with him after which he showed chris screenshots of conversations between them Chris then said that maybe it wouldn t be a good idea After Huk telling him these things and showing the screenshots If Huk kept his mouth shut he would a been on the show
thoorin despises discussions even on his own talk shows instead of actually debating a point he does one of several things 1 Comes up with a bullshit analogy that distracts from the conversation 2 Agree with somebody making a counter point nods his head and then moves the discussion along or 3 Ignores what the other person is saying gives his long rant and then moves the discussion along
To be fair though he can actually be a pretty good host when he removes his ego For instance on SI he is very fair and ask interesting question with the occational counterpoint but not in an aggressive way And his reflection series are also pretty good But unfortunately when he lets his ego come out he is just unbearable He will make an occational point but will also make tons of strawmans and see everything in black white the whole time And he has the most insane doublestandards I have seen As an example he often complaints that people on the internet tell Thorin RL what their personality is like based on a few instances Like Thorin doesn t think RL should be cut from Dreamhack becaused of RL s physical violence On the other hand he is making propaganda against Reginald TSM owner LOL team because Regi during a documentary was aggressive towards teammates on 2 occations a few years ago Thorin has stated that Regi is sadistic enjoys messing with other peoples emotion making them feel inferior etc And also compared him to a monkey due to his looks The ironic thing is that all ex TSM members have actually praised Regi They see him as a friend and a great person but who occationally can get a bit too emotional But no no Thorin knows better based on 2 video clips And to just add an extra layer to the double double standard He also constantly talk about how its justified that players are toxic rages a lot since superstar individuals often have huge ego s hence why he often defends Naniwa But apparently Regi is sadistic because he raged 2 3 years ago
Completely agree wish he was a lot more neutral as a person his content is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me since when he behaves like the way you have mentioned I feel disappointed to enjoy it
so basically a european destiny
They are very similar in many ways But fascinatingly different in others
I meant the whole you cant actually have a discussion with either that doesnt turn into yelling filled with antagonism and horrible analogies
Watch Summoning Insight Plenty of pro players there disagree with Thorin and he often yields and holds their opinion over his due to them having more info experience on the matter discussed He won t respect people no matter what opinion if they are unable to back it up with coherent logic
But on this topic of region locking he doesnt seem to be willing to bow at all
because regionlocking doesn t make any sense at all from his point of view all he wants is see top class esport not subsidised pseudo competition where trash players make more money than elite players of an different region he would go nuts about it in every game that s also the reason he despises the lcs model of riot
It s also one of the reasons he loves tennis
If he wants top class SC2 competition he should be happy with region locking because if Koreans wouldn t travel to events they would train more for GSL SSL and we would see better matches in those leagues He wants them to travel so he will watch them play while jetlagged and they will play foreigners mostly that s not highest level of play And in international tournaments you play several matches which players can t prepare for and this leads to lower standard of games That s why I m for region locking so players that would normally travel all the time would practise and play in korean leagues If hydra would play in Korea players practising with him would improve and we would see better games Thorin is just butthurt foreigners earn money while playing worse than Koreans not because he wants highest level competition International level tournaments always had worse players than in korean leagues so if you only care about highest level of play you shouldn t care about iem dh regardless of region locking
Did someone say horrible analogy
Difference is Destiny realizes that about himself Thorin is willfully ignorant of it
Destiny does yell a lot and rages sometimes which means he can definitely be unfairly dominating a discussion but I d say he s much more willing to re evaluate his own opinions and can still have meaningful discussions He often actively seeks out people with opposing viewpoints to debate with and hears them out on his stream Thorin s given me the impression with this and previous events that he doesn t tolerate anyone who could actually have a meaningful debate with him Feels like he is much more locked into his beliefs
A fun game I ve been playing the last few days is to replace Thorin with Destiny in reddit comments and it tends to fit pretty well And that s coming from someone who is a fan of both
ehh destiny tends to be a lot more emotional and blunt whereas thoorin is more subtle and relaxed
sir what fuckin planet are you from cause subtle and relaxed does not describe thorin
more subtle and relaxed than destiny but yeah actually you are right
I laughed so hard I fucking died and became a ghost from this post
all his Discussions involve him initiating name calling and frankly sad pathetic attempts at insults I mean look at his conversation with destiny frankly a wonder Thorin is taken seriously at all let alone in the starcraft community he hasn t really been a part of it in a long time and barely has any real understanding of the game or the community as a whole at this point
I think it s you with no real understanding
Fucking insane how delusional the SC2 community has become the game is essentially dead and there s nothing to gain from helping or do content for this game unless you actually have some love for it
I would like to see this with a good moderator
Whats wrong with Rotti
Well they already had a discussion right On remax with 4 guys having the same opinion
Thorin won t be on a show with people that have a different opinion then his He whines like a baby and then exits the call mid show if someone doesn t agree with him and don t give in to his ideas
are there vods where I can see this cause that sounds funny as hell
This is probably the best example Bonus context on 2GD
Both 2GD and Destiny can give him a run for his money in a discussion
2GD can pretty much shit on anybody in a discussion D
Jesus Lewis was one depressing cunt that show Love 2GD
thanks I believed it I just had to see it for my self XD
funnily enough these are the only two examples
He did it on Lycan s show where he basically rage quit after again blaming destiny for the Poland incident Lemme see if I can find it EDIT Found it https www youtube com watch v D6TeurUSHAw
thanks XD
There is on YouTube I ve seen it in 2 different shows I can t give you a link in at work and on mobile sorry
Yeah but then we d have to listen to thorin
Could always mute the stream when he talks and unmute when huk rotterdam talk
We would only get to listen to 5 10 minutes of an hour long episode then
More time to play sc2 then
Implying anyone here actually plays sc2
You gotta check out the discord turns out there s dozens of us who play the game https discordapp com channels 121390401386053633 121390401386053633
I play sc2 the people who bitch moan the most also probably play sc2 the people who ask questions in the noob thread play as well
u iBleeedorange can you post your battle net account I wanna blame your moderator skills because you re platinum league s
http us battle net sc2 en profile 587322 1 iBleedOrange Looks like he is Diamond with random currently and a good player overall
huh I m a masters zerg in 1v1 Diamond random in team games
Ibleedorange 1842
And only get another echochamber to save yourself from other opinions I m sure you d like that
but then id get r starcraf2circlejerk in video form
Destiny has to be there as well
Too bad that would never happen as Thorin would never bring someone on who could actually argue
destiny can argue but can t debate for shit
Both of them are pseudo intellectuals
haha you think destiny can actually argue christ what destiny and thorin do is not arguing
It s definitely arguing Whether or not it s debating is probably uh debatable
I think you re confusing arguing and debating
Only thing Thorin cares about is that the venue isnt in Poland
This need to be posted everytime thorin is mentioned
To be fair he had always said he liked BW more and he has actually written very good articles on BW P
Oh shit boys please make that happen would be entertaining to watch D
even in the show they were talking about how he is just clickbaiting and shitposting and he didnt deny it So why are you buying more of it
who the fuck cares
Esports shitstorian
Stop giving this clown attention you fucking retards
can we just forget who Thorin is already
Why He provides some quality drama and P E R S O N A L I T Y which is exactly what we want here
Why He produces excellent content
No one is criticizing his content the way he argues with people on twitter on the other hand is questionable to say the least
Then don t follow him on twitter
lol no wonder this community is essentially dead when attitudes like this are around
Why are we still even taking this wannabe who hasn t played a game of Sc2 in his life seriously
Because this is the only thing going on in SC2 that the subreddit cares about Seriously I haven t even looked at starcraft in years and this brought me back for a sneak peek
Thorin is just cringe worthy The e sports historian Plus the way he communicates sounds like he just has to prove everyone else wrong and be the guy with the absolute final say He says he promotes discussion and would have no issue but has this neurotic end statement like everyone is out to get him make him out to be the bad guy Pick a lane and stick with it Jeez
If you want a real discussion Thorin I would suggest not opening with lines like SC2 is non existent in Korea Non existent
I think what he s trying to say is that SC2 s popularity is a small fraction of LoL s popularity or BW s popularity from a few years ago I m sure he s just using hyperbole He knows that there s a SC2 scene in Korea
Yeah but it sets the tone for the entire conversation
good point
I don t know why he would even mention this since apparently he doesn t care This is based on his comments about the prize pool or crowd size of TI not mattering and the play being best when the prizes are small This all from the lecture he gave chanmanv when he dared to ask about The International One thing that s for certain is that when it comes to professional players SC2 is very strong in Korea which is why this whole region lock thing is even a topic
So lets see E sports chronicler goes on show with dickriding buddy and goes on a 1 hour tirade without anyone present on the show to present counterpoints and then tweets this https twitter com Thooorin status 692729272729997312 Now THAT is fucking hysterical D
Hey all I haven t followed SC2 scene at all but I ve been following Thorin alot for other esports related news Lately I ve seen Thorin bashing on SC2 community REALLY HARD whats going on When did all this hate start and why did it happen
He is not bashing on the community rather than bashing on the new WCS system
He is outright bashing the whole community His latest tweet was about how we deserve the scene we got
Look at this thread how can you disagree with him
And calling us racist that don t like sc2 if we like them
He is only calling those who like the new WCS system changes discriminatory
He used the term racist multiple times But any way I was circle jerking so I don t really care Thorin has a lot of valid points but he is such a fucking dickhead about the way he communicates it that you just don t even want to make the effort of agreeing
also the community though if you read his twitter he specifically calls it out
Like the WHOLE community Or a subset of it
tl dr Thorin is trying to be edgy to gain attention He doesnt know shit about sc2 as a game so this is the only way he can stay a little bit relevant to the scene no region locking was making all the b team koreans come overseas to beat the shit out of foreigners due to their incredibly superior practice environment the bigass industry backing them up Something that doesnt really exist in the foreign scene since there simply isnt enough financial support think of it as what would happen if Nigeria just started up its own hockey league and is investing money into teaching people hockey then Detroit Red Wings sends their b team to win all the money invested only to then return to the US So not only did foreign tournaments not get to see their own scenes grow rather the opposite happend people quit playing and very slim amount of quality practice were to be had outside of korea because whats the point when you can never compete about the money placements no matter how hard you try on top of that it was never the tip top koreans that came overseas to grab the prizepools so you couldnt even market it as absolute top starcraft For 2016 blizzard basically regionlocked the foreigner WCS circuit think of it as NHL for sc2 and spread out the prizepools immensely which means that it now pays off to become a pro even if youre not from Korea or one of the very very few top foreigners who had enough talent to compete vs these korean b teamers half of the scene is arguing that this will help a dying foreign scene grow and it will be more interesting to see foreigners win something rather than hype the idea of maybe possibly a foreigner can get top8 The other half believes this is hurting the koreans too much and that its not okay for them and then you have ignorant something that rhimes with schmidiots like Thorin who doesnt care about sc2 never cared about sc2 doesnt want the foreign scene to grow but it sounds pretty cool to be able to claim that koreans should get all the money because they are the best and if you enjoy watching regional and local competition imagine watching the Swedish hockey league or the Finnish hockey league over the olympics or any kind of play thats on a lower level than the absolute top you dont like sc2 and youre not a fan of the game Except that his argument doesnt even make sense because as ive already mentioned it was never the top koreans coming over so it wasnt even the top tier sc2 play hes arguing about sorry for the rant
this was a really good explanation thanks
But we are forgeting something very important in the heydays of western SC2 they had all that good salaries training houses coaches multiple lans etc and at that point so many succesfull players adopted the idea that results are not the only thing that matters and were content with having good salaries and streaming money but practically no one invested in the future of SC2 there were not serious attempts to foster local talent for example via mentoring or like adopt an aspiring player type of programs hell even the online cups were affected by this type of attitude remember Shoutcraft NA and the Take tv acer team league that so many players failed to even show up Fast forward 3 years when the viewer numbers are not there anymore and the teams are no longer giving good salaries for most players and now is a problem that koreans win all the prize money well guess what that was bound to happen from the begining because koreans train really really hard and were just reaping the rewards of their hard work I find that ironic to say the least
the foreign scene NEVER had the practice environment KESPA is providing to its players
What do Kespa provide that EG TL Fnatic Complexity MYI didn t in their good old days
Legal structure with real coaching environments KESPA is a government organization Team houses in Korea are actual training houses with schedules where the coaches are there working with and guiding the players every step of the way whereas the nonkorean team houses have a reputation of being more like frat houses and totally not comparable to the korean team houses KESPA also works to help secure sponsorships for pro teams in korea while elsewhere that s up to the teams themselves meaning foreign teams often had less money and therefore players had to rely more on streaming for income which is bad for them competitively because people can copy their builds while koreans spent that time practicing in relative secrecy
Dont forget that on top of all this KESPA have experience since the days of brood war leagues where the players are constantly playing against eachother as well as well developed coaching not only for ingame stuff but also things such as mechanics how theyre using the keyboard etc
Leaving the legal and sponsors part aside I want to focus only in practice enviroment I think you overvalue the role of the sc2 coaches in Kespa teams so many players have talked about how their actual role is more of a player manager than a practice coach most of the korean practice time is spend in the ladder with the obvious exception of preparing a specific build for a map in proleague or the single elimination bracket of a GSL or SSL Now you talk about players needing to suplement their income with things like streaming that is true now but in the past there were players like Huk or Naniwa who opted for less team salary in favor of also less mandatory streaming hours Now of course I m not suggesting that foreigner pros had the same posibilities to perform in the grand live tournaments as the koreans what I want to come across is that the foreign scene failed until this point at least to create a proper structure in wich they could compete and thrive without the intrusion of the more stablished and structured scene in south Korea and that that lack of grassroots events is the real problem as Carmac has said we need to provide players a middle step between top 10 GM ladder and DH champion over someone like Life Leenok or Hyun But at least I do feel that way some of us feel wrong to penalice koreans whom the only thing that they have done all this time is practice practice practice and compete We are not talking that WCS says somethig like if you are a Kespa player you are not allowed in any WCS circuit event but rather all can paricipate except Korean born players
don t forget shit like him claiming that there are no fucking arguments for the Koreans getting the short end and all of us SC2 fan are circle jerking for the foreigners
It all started with him saying that the WCS changes are bad and then the community started attacking him and this is what you got now
removed
Well the thing is half things he said were straight lies and the fact no one was there to actually debate and it turned into an hour long circle jerk
Everything I said was the straight truth and that was his point There s a reason you didn t even try to debate the points I made and instead shifted to some vague comment about Thorin lying with not a single example to back up that claim
He has an opinion about the new WCS system while still saying he doesn t know what s the best for the game When there s a backlash because of his retarded opinions he claims the scene is a major echochamber as everyone calls out on his bullshit and proceeds to attack everyone in the scene the game itself
I am pretty sure Chanman said that the wording isn t really accurate here
Probably so just found it funny reading contradicting statements one after the other
Wish ChanmanV would just stand up and fucking publicly say what the deal is himself
He would need to find his spine first
I was pretty happy when Thorin left the sc2 community to pursue csgo and league Are there no lol events right now or what s the deal I think he s a bit of a xenophobic douche with really bad communication skills But if he wants to stir up drama he might as well do it the right way and invite Steven Bonnell II on his little show
Why do you guys give him so much attention
Dudes a troll with a microphone
I guess we should settle everything down in a proper debate Thorin might be a verbal baiter and very agressive on socialmedia but i guess it would be very interesting to hear his arguments not in 180 letters D He might be a douche right now but i feel his opinion can only bring good
Honestly I really hope that this happens I would touch myself through the whole thing enjoying all of the weak arguments defending foreigner handouts getting rekt by Thorin
Pretty sure he s just doing this to save face and has no real intention of doing such show I d love to be proven wrong though
Shit drama storm about to hit Run for your sanity
jake ravi and nick do it better
I hope people realize that he s manufactured his own notoriety and is about to turn it into a story
Why is region locking WCS so bad I thought LCS was region locked but I m not sure dont really follow LoL
He has no issue with people that want to join even if those people came from Poland or an user third world country Just kidding
He just won t stop He will never stop
I don t check Reddit for 1 day because I think it ll be boring 1 day and this sub is suddenly on fire RL leaving Unfiltered apparently some crazy drama on the first Unfiltered Esports centric episode the Thorin drama thing seems to have gotten exponentially worse I have no idea what s going on Do we still hate nathanias or is that last weeks drama What s the subs current opinion on Desrow destiny lycan and Naniwa I need direction here
This potato guy is in every tweet mentioning thorin defending him Could it be another Ann Pragg
Thorin follows him and RTs his dumb shit every now and then POtato is thorins biggest fanboy
Since when are you in Starcraft Know you have certain opinions regarding Thorin but isn t EU LCS on or something
Im not really but I happened to stumble across this comment
Plz stop giving this fucktard more attention
I just read through some of his tweets I d rather SC2 die tommorow than he have anything to do with the game He s literal fucking scum I d pay good money to see someone kick him in the face
Stop givong this moron the attention just banish him out of the community like he deserves he is incapable of having a normal discusion with another human being
Why the fuck would HuK and RotterdaM go on Thorins show hosted by Thorin If you want this to be done fairly go on a show hosted by a 3rd party like Unfiltered or The Late Game where a host can moderate the depate oh but wait Thorin doesn t want people he doesnt like on those shows
the battle is about to begin
Would be a good thing imo Not with HuK or Rotterdam but with Apollo and maybe Destiny for the counter rant nothing more
How about we stop giving him attention Let s try that
Why is this douche even an issue Why does anyone care what he says The only time I ve ever heard this guy s name come up is when he says ignorant flame baiting bullshit He s just an esports version of ann coulter Ignore him
https twitter com Thooorin status 692733223395291136 This shithead has some serious problems judging a whole community on some twitter bashing Srsly if he has so much problems with our scene why does he even mention SC2 to begin with Just shut the fuck up and move on with your life we are better off without you
The SC2 community lives up to every stereotype that is being said about it way to go Fucking disgusting behavior from our community right now
Never seen a Esport community act more entitled and willing to fabricate drama out of nothing like this Disgusting
I will not watch any talk show that has Thorin as a member of the panel all he does is get triggered and ruin shows and I ve had enough of him derailing shows with his tirades
Thorin coming in to talk about starcraft would be like me coming in to talk about Starcraft I literally don t own the game and I only watch a few streams I don t even watch the tournaments WHEN WILL I GET ON UNFILTERED This is probably just an act by the SC2 community afraid of REAL discussion
How does he manage to piss off communities from literally every game I ve seen posts about him and drama in just about every competitive video game subreddit I frequent at one point or another
There are a lot of children in esports that includes some adult children as well
Good to see Thorin taking the ole Spinnmeister 9000 out for a drive Hey guise I TOTES wanted a serious discussion HuK is lying being disingenuous about wanting to come on the show What a prat
Ignores the words looks at the avatar Checks out
I m tired of people dismissing my work only because I m writing for Breitbart now ugh so triggering lol anime avatar That s very consistent of him
These guys are ridiculous I think we should really just ignore them RL and Thorin only bring dumb discussions up and respond like 12 year olds when someone comes with reasonable arguments lol
Dont forget tries to strangle you when he makes a joke about your girlfriend and you come up to him
What was the joke
Remember He rapes and kills your mother after he kidnapped her and you called the police
Not sure what you re trying to imply here but I could ve wrote the exact same thing in a different format Not sure why it matters Here It s funny RL gets rustled at people dismissing his work only because of the outlet he writes to when he dismiss peoples opinions based on their avatars Doesn t seem very consistent to me
No I m pretty sure he saw the words you know the ones that clearly misrepresented their opinion on the topic
Judging a book by it s cover
He has an absolute fucking shitty point to make and has no problem attacking chanman RL and thorin Comment well deserved
I but Is trying to argue against this what it s like when people try to debate with Thorin I ll just laugh then LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL get a brain
It s funny cuz there were a bunch of people with anime avatars choking on thorin and RL s dicks in the youtube comments I bet they felt great with that comment lmao
The worst thing is They analyze the problem by ranting about it how everything got worse how bad it is in korea etc thats fine cool But as long as they don t come up with a possible solution or some point that maybe solves the deeper problems they should calm the fuck down
They did Let Koreans play everywhere
Thats not a solution We had that before did it solve anything
What does it solve to lock koreans out of the scene How do you guys know that region locking that actively prevents proper highest level competition will help
region locking is also employed in real sports when one country has such an edge over others that that country would just win every top 8 in every single competition look Norway in skiing Having a force that dominant is VERY unhealthy because it drives everybody that isn t a hardcore fan away Bot all SC2 viewers watch just to always have the best of the best but also because they want to see some people from their country compete Why do you think are local leagues so popular in sports like soccer I mean there probably need to be more events for Koreans to participate in but honestly getting destroyed again and again while not getting much support doesn t motivate any foreign players
They are not locked out of the scene let s be real or a discussion is pointless No doubt that it affects koreans negatively but overall it could work Nobody knows until it s tested though
That s a suggestion a bad one and not a solution Besides which Koreans CAN play everywhere They simply need to move to where they want to play If I am a top collegiate basketball player and want to go pro but don t make it into the NBA what are my options I can stay here and complain about the lack of opportunities or I can move to Turkey and play in their league A lesser league for sure but a pro league that helps develop their talent and has good support within their region That exact scenario holds true for Korean SC2 players
and foreigners CAN play at a Korean level They simply need to train like Koreans
Very true And hopefully now that there is a legitimate chance for them to win tournaments make money maybe people will Look at uThermal He said that previously he practiced a lot less had only goals of competing and having fun Now he practices six hours a day on stream and some off That is still not at the level of the Koreans like Bomber who practice what 12 hours a day And with the help of a coach and teammates
Well there always was a legitimate chance for them to win tournaments Just not a legitimate chance that they d make themselves train like Koreans But the psychological effect you describe is real enough Playing in the kiddie pool can motivate you to eventually move to the adults
Great reply showing how much he truly cares about E sports s Neckbeard avatar checks out
He showed us how to ad hominem 101 right here
No ad hominem from the original comment right The term retarded was only used 3 times to describe the statement even though this guy takes great pleasure in misunderstanding it
It s not an ad hominem fallacy if you insult someone while you re disagreeing with them It is only the fallacy when you use the insult as the REASON to disagree with them All the points that you made were completely stupid you retard Not ad hominem You are a retard therefore all your points are stupid ad hominem
Add homo to the what now
An ad hominem attack is when you resort to attack a someone s person rather than their argument Basically you couldn t come up with something that actually counters their argument so you resort to calling them stupid fat anime faggot etc
You will find that when you distort and misrepresent the things someone said and try to argue those instead of their actual points the response is often justifiably dismissive
Yeah This 4 word post says much more than hundreds of articles published about esports and thousands of hours of effort put into the scene Get your head out of your ass that clearly wasn t a response to be taken seriously in any way RL knows just as well as the next guy that this show wasn t for educational or scientific purposes it served as a means of entertainment and nothing more I haven t watched the show and i don t need to in order to say this but thats what you fucking get if you watch a show featuring a person without a personality and Thorin RL
Richard Lewis is extremely thin skinned for a person who has made a career out of shitting on people If you can dish it out you you should be able to accept the same in return
well than the same should go for the people you dish out at him like the guy in this post right
deleted
That was already known when he had the meltdown on the lol subreddit
No it showcases his lack of interest You on the other hand are showcasing your inabilty to properly read a situation without letting your extreme bias influence your conclusion you piece together whatever nonsense you can to prove how evil and childish Richard Lewis is instead of objectively looking at what is going on Trust me if you could read that much out of 4 words there would be no need to study linguistic science Try to be a at least little reasonable I honestly don t give half a fuck about who or how RL is but if you want to prove RL s incredible man child like qualities and his complete inability to take any criticism I would like to ask you to take a more intellectual approach find actual sources and reasons other than 4 words that are tinctured with indifference You make yourself look like a child that is desperate to discredit a person it doesn t like and will do anything to achieve that goal
the criticism isn t even directed at him and anyone with an anime avatar looks stupid
Much less than dodging an opinion like a manchild
Opinions
richard s face also looks stupid doesn t mean he shouldn t get a proper answer for making a good point
Anyone with an anime avatar does look stupid
you offend my waifuu
deleted
I mean Richard looks like that but he s far from a white knight and I don t think he jumps to women s defence he writes for breitbart for christs sake haha
You re misapplying that label
As much as I don t like Anime avatar people should focus more on the content written not on the author
What s wrong with anime avatars
a lot of people think anime avatar weeb in other words nothing
Well it does
It s basically people who make a living talking about video games looking down on someone for watching anime which is pretty silly Not that I think there s anything wrong with talking about video games since I m posting on r starcraft it s just funny how people shit on things like anime avatars while spending all their time playing video games
Because it s informal and childish
Because Video Games are supposed to be formal and professional
To be honest the counter arguments to their points were really bad and also lied regarding the knowledge they have of the scene more Thoring than Richard Lewis but if you have watched the episode you would see that Richard didn t comment much on it
deleted
Well yeah he could have said things a lot better I agree but he still makes some valid points I believe we should not focus so much on the negative side of things Like I ve seen this happen a lot people focus on details that are not that important anyway and don t pay attention to what really matters His choice of words are pretty far from perfect and he has an anime avatar Fuck what he says
This is how you win arguments when you have a following Personal attacks are always quick easy and witty enough to end any debate
This is the same guy that uses the number of twitter followers as an argument against someone
Are you happy you stated that My life wouldn t be complete without your opinion
Ironically the anime avatar is something that a lot of GamerGate supporters are criticized for people will say anime avatar typical and people like Richard will jump on them saying that s the reply you use when you can t respond meaningfully etc
that happened
Thus the irony
No one is saying that you shouldn t watch your favorite player over the best they are saying your favorite player shouldn t have an unfair advantage at becoming successful
exactly but up until now it was the other way around lets have only the most successful everywhere no need for qualifiers either in a lot of cases invite them in Region restrictions are good but they should be there from the start now it might be too late but we will see if everyone makes bad analogies here I will add one too imagine basketball had only one global league and american teams not one but teams would ride the world and won everything do you think that there would be some basketball player community growing in all those other countries no no one would bother but right now people have their national leagues they cheer their home heroes and hope that they will show great performance against americans at world championships olympics you must protect your market even koreans themselves agree on them for example Um Jay Kyung in the ogn talkshaw that was broadcasted some year ago talked about this
It wasn t the other way around before this Invites are as dumb now as they used to be Everyone should have to qualify for tournaments like IEM I don t like any of the analogies in this thread But really look at soccer Certain countries dominate but everyone still has a great scene We live in a world where we can play with someone across the earth in seconds The sports analogies don t really work The Koreans aren t really doing anything tricky They re working hard and working with their teams to become better players The foreign scene can do the same and we ve had foreigners come close to being at the top when they give it their all Foreigners don t need charity
Yeah look at soccer The top players in the world MOVE to where the top soccer is played Everyone is welcome there The opposite is not true In the various other regions teams have quotas that cap the number if players from outside their regions This very much like the new WCS system The best players can go to Korea If you are of that level you are welcome But if you want to play in the other regions you need to be from there or get a visa It s really a no brainer and baffling how people can be against it
I m not sure this analogy works because even if there were players from outside Korea good enough to compete with Koreans which there aren t the monetary motivation to go there simply doesn t exist Soccer is different because unlike Starcraft the best leagues with the highest level of competition is where all the big money is
It is so disingenuous to say the lesser the players deserve more when players better than them are receiving less
you still don t get it go back to thinking about it Everyone deserves a region to play in in the first place Korea has that but want to expand it into Korea 2 Korea 3 and so on And they are still welcome But then must get part of that region And not fly around for easy moneygrabs and then back to Korea This system only supported Korea over proportional
So you are blaming the Koreans for grabbing the money because they are the better players
No I bliming nobody besides Blizzard not fully region lock from beginning I just say whoever wants to play in a specific region should also be part of it No one want s to see some NBA team destroying the complete competition in Korea year and year again because they are not on the same level at BBall But I guess it s ok you probably don t get it because of your mental handicap or something You are saying Koreans shouldn t be allowed to have their own Basketball league You are an idiot
WTF NBA Teams dont go to other regions cuz the money is less im pretty fking sure they would move if the money was somewere else alot of typos
foreign pros need something attainable to shoot for They didn t have that before They also don t have the luxury of leaving high school and going to a team house to play Had I had option I would have gone to live 6 to a room to play video games full time after high school I m sure there are plenty of foreign pros that think the same We don t have these luxuries in the west and because of that among other things we re starting off at a significant disadvantage Not only are the koreans currently stronger players but they have more tools with which to succeed and that is what is frustrating to me If you want players to improve you don t put the high schoolers up against the lakers You get them to play better high schools and then when they re at the top they play colleges finally they play the pros We don t have those options right now while being able to survive Our pros have to rely on measly team salaries and streaming neither of which are exactly reliable Unless they re supported fully by family western pros are doing all this shit at the same time they re going to school or are working so they can afford their apartments or are at the very least managing their own time and practice habits without legitimate coaching or support staff There is no unfair advantage here with these changes the unfair advantage has always been in Korea These changes offer another option for supporting a pro gamer lifestyle that the west simply didn t have before
I think my favourite player should have an advantage only in his own home region
Affirmative Foreignction
Not a surprise Richard Lewis is the type of guy who has such poor emotional intelligence he resorts to attacking people when presenting with criticism or in a conflict Be it verbal ad hominem or physically attacking someone as we saw when he attempted to strangle a Dota 2 Pro and got kicked out of and banned from Dreamhack
So ironic you did the exact same thing right here
Nothing I stated was ad hominem as I am not criticizing or trying to undermine his stance on this topic which I don t even fully know nor really care I m purely critiquing the behaviour he has displayed towards others whilst being a professional in the Esports scene
He could have easily pointed out that the Cowboys division the NFC East is guaranteed a spot in the playoffs even if everyone in the division was crap compared to other divisions The NFL does this to ensure there are teams from across the United States in the playoffs to keep viewership higher
That s actually what happened this year The division was the joke of the NFL and every time that happens people bust out the term NFC Least
Ha To true They forget that up until the last decade the NFC East had more super bowl titles than the rest of the league
In one example you have a country wide league splitting into two even groups In the other example you have a global league that singles out one country in particular to exclude If we kept trying to fit this example it would be like having four dominant teams from one state and the rest of the country kicks them out of the league because they re too good
Lol You know that all of the division teams hate each other right I can guarantee that most Eagles Giants and Cowboys fans were rooting against the Redskins in the playoffs The reason why there s divisions is to create those kinds of rivalries not to please a certain geographic region
Damn you Cowboys Eagles and Giants fans My team needed everyone s support
and if you don t support my team which is clearly better than yours you are no REAL football fan How is it even possible for someone to argue that way It s mind boggling stupidity
Are you saying I am arguing that point My post was simply to the fact that my team lost badly and that s all
No just wanted to extend on it I guess we think the same
And that same logic can t be translated to regionalizing sc2 It helps build story lines and show personality of players rather than having the same 10 people say thank you I will try hard for fans and walk off stage The rivalries get even bigger and more important both in Korea as well as we get to see development in foreign story lines rather than omg 2 foreigners didn t get knocked out round one Hype Personally I think blizzard made a bad decision in the way they regionalized tournaments but your argument was awful
That is what the numerous online cups and smaller non premier tournaments are for See the Jon Snow vs PiLiPiLi rivalry showmatch of a few weeks ago
Oh the ones that are for 40 and cast by someone you ve never heard of before Also where you only see one game per round and no interviews with the players What a way to build storylines
Dude there are regional qualifiers for every Dreamhack and IEM where players from the same areas face each other all of the time Do you want the same players placed in the same groups at every dreamhack I don t even understand what you are arguing for
I already said that I don t think the way blizzard handled it was the best way I was arguing that your point was stupid That s not the reason the system is bad and that s actually one thing that improved with this system There are lots of other problems but what you were trying to argue was not one of them
The fact that western fans still can not accept the factual Korean dominance in SC2 after all these years is probably the embodiment of why esport has yet to be a thing compared to real sports
What I don t think any fan if this sport doesn t know Korea dominates it That laughable That does change the fact the region locking is a good idea for the future of the game Everyone can play in the top region Korea if they are good enough No one currently is except Koreans Everyone is welcome to play in the other regions if you live there or are a citizen Look at nearly every other big sport and it has similar rules to protect the regional play and players
If not for the fact that it hurts the better players for the sake of the lesser players And within real sports well perhaps that is why tennis which does not run a region lock feels the most competitive among popular sports
Tennis is a great example of the opposite plan Everyone good enough plays anywhere The main difference is that tennis is an extremely well established sport We have been playing tennis for a couple hundred years now Starcraft2 is an emerging sport by contrast This is why some protection is needed to develop the scene around the world Ideally in the future it can be completely open but the world needs to catch up to what the Koreans have done
IMO the thing about region lock is that if anything it provides even less incentives for players to improve because they can always grab the easy money and would never need to think about catching up to the Koreans
Don t know about that Before a foreigner had zero chance of winning Dreamhack or IEM Now they have a chance even though they still have to win a lot of games and plow through many opponents Yes it is now nearly certain that a foreigner will win but which one Bunny has to practice hard to get through Snute uThermal Lilbo and on and on Those guys now have more incentive to practice since their goal can be to WIN a tournament instead of just finish in the tip 8 or 4 Seeing these guys win this last time over Violet and Hydra gives other lower ranked players incentive to practice and hopefully move up as well You don t know where genius will come from New players are cropping up in Korea Speed DRGzergling etc so maybe someone crops up here Hitman Neeb etc
when it was really big lots of attention cool to follow Thorin Keep that i mind
Thorin was very involved in the CS GO scene since launch though back in 2012 2013 that was a smaller scene than Starcraft is now
No doubt but that s what he said
That was pretty funny
terrible debate checks out
I m not gonna lie I loled
yea anime dps are a red flag
RL is a decent journalist but a gaping asshole Too bad Thorin keeps pairing with him everywhere even when said RL physically assault other people
Thorin is the verbal equivalent of RL I still can t believe anyone cares what he thinks
I only follow CS GO closely and as much as Thorin can be a bit much I really like his analysis He s often on point has a good bit of knowledge on the game Sometimes his banter tends to overcome his analysis and he doesn t always let other people speak but he s a good analyst and there aren t much in the scene Imo that can compensate his abrasiveness especially on Twitter where he just trolls everyone and just acts like an asshole 24 7 RL still lives off the iBP scandal and built a legitimate reputation on it But his current input in the CS GO is very minor compared to Thorin He s from time to time desk host something other people have done way better than him I get how Thorin and RL are friend so they support each other But in terms of public image RL drags Thorin down everytime Thorin tries to defend RL publicly
I m finding it ironic how people are taking these obviously hyperbolic statements from RL Thorin and interpreting them literally to make this weird strawman counterpoint to a discussion no one s even having If you re upset about them diverting the topic then maybe stop doing it yourself You can watch and prefer whichever players you want It gets a little weird when a competition like Dreamhack goes so far as to exclude a single country from participation in an otherwise global event though You d think that we d want the very best players at our most prestigious tournaments except certain viewers don t if those players happen to be of a specific ethnicity It s sort of amazing to me how people have managed to convince themselves that this is anything but racist
What the discussion of Thorin being a massive bellend I think a lot of people are currently having this discussion
If Norway had the by far best players in the world then Norway would be region locked It has nothing to do with racism
I really doubt Dreamhack would ever lock a European country out of it for being too good
Region locking or at least limiting competitors from dominant countries is a common practice in many sports like Skiing where the Norwegians actually supported such a limit themselves because they were just winning everything without much contest I really don t think DH did what they did because of the ethnicity of the participants
I d be interested in other examples of that because I d be pretty surprised if other sports were actually singling out specific countries and excluding them from global competitions If the US wanted to kick Canada out of the NHL then I think everyone would realize how ridiculous the idea is but it seems ok with Korea in SC2 probably in no small part because they re on the other side of the globe People want to see foreigners win because they re more relatable This has been their sentiment forever and motivated making WCS more and more exclusive That s 100 about ethnicity If China was more successful then they d probably ban China too If France is dominating too much though then of course they aren t going to do anything about it they re not going to put together a whole new WCS circuit just for France But Korea s managed to put together their own infrastructure which ironically lands them with getting banned from foreign WCS And then foreign WCS actually falls apart and has now been inserted into the only two remaining global tournaments that Korea could ever attend forcing Korea out of them as well I find that all kind of fucked up
It s not exclusion I worded that badly They are just imposing limitations on the number of athletes from for example Norway so that an all Norwegian Top10 can t happen They still win but other nations also have a chance to place in the money I don t think that a hard lock is all that great but it s better for the foreign scene than having no kind of limitation Maybe there will be a better system in the future
France still is allowed to play your argument is invalid
Well RL has a good point
fucking destroyed lmao
And do you really think that he will acknowledge that this episode was trainwrack It was his job as a co host to challenge thorin because chanman cant sadly and instead he just ride his little thorin
I personally think in any game the best of the best should play in big competition If Koreans are the best at it so be it If the Europeans are the best so be it I would much rather see the top 16 best players play rather than 8 best and 8 great But thats me
The question depends on who is asking As a fan I want to see the best players but as Blizzard they would want to see what is best for the game So if they think region locking players helps develop more and better players in regions outside of South Korea that already has the best players then why wouldn t they make the change Now we can argue whether this will work out for the best for the game but I can t blame them for doing it
Blizzard wants to see players from all regions That is how they want to grow SC2 as a global esport by having leagues and championships that represent and include players from all regions not just Korea
Too bad its awful for business or else you wouldnt need Blizzard to practically fund everything It may work for other scenes but it sure wasnt working here Your big esports tournament organizers wanted out for the past year You guys want a tournament with no discrimination Fund one yourselves cause atm funding any sc2 event is an act charity Atleast when the stream has low viewers numbers no one is going to have declare bankruptcy
Dude got fucking owned r starcraft is giving him a burn cream bukakake right now
Why would Richard Lewis or anyone who knows his shit give a serious response to a post like this The poster claims he knows more than two journalists that have worked in the scene and goes on to rant about stuff he clearly doesnt know much about himself I dont understand how anyone could qualify this as criticism this is just some dude crying about how he didnt like the show
lol weeaboos
Sry but this criticism is hardly worth responding to anyway Pretty much the definition of a shitpost i would make fun of it too if i were RL
Would you mind telling me why I think this dude makes valid points I ve enjoyed watching games from foreigners as much as watching top korean games sometimes even more It s not because you re not watching the top players that games are less entertaining
The way it is worded is just asking for it imo His arguments are mostly insults tbh or at least phrased like that If you are a public figure you simply cannot take such a comment seriously otherwise you have to hang yourself
What He asked for more knowledgable people in each esport area on an esport show that seems fair Then shows us how the guests relied on 1 point which he debunked with a few examples I don t think he was insulting anyone rather than pointing out a glaring flaw in an esports show the SC2 reddit has been the main viewership of
I don t get it He s not allowed to disagree with people on their points I don t even know who this guy is if he s anyone meaningful but I think it s reasonable to give some backlash to a SC2 show that has no one from the SC2 community
They should listen to how Richard and Thoorin respectfully lay out their points with facts evidence in a polite manner without the need to bad mouth anyone
well thorin is mostly insulting himself for example the response came out of frustration perfectly fine
Believe it could have been said better yeah like when he says that they don t know more than the average redditor this is just plain stupid But to be fair when Thorin or Richard Lewis are answering to someone they disagree they aren t necessarily doing better sometimes Look at answers from Thorin on Twitter about that topic I like them but they re not above other people because they re public figures
See i don t say they are necessarily above other people but if you are a public figure you will get hate NO MATTER WHAT From a lot of guys On a daily basis You also will get criticized a lot if that criticism isn t at least worded somewhat reasonably why should you take it seriously I mean that guy at least wrote more than haha thorin and richard lewis suck but it pretty much comes down to that anyway D
Well yeah can t disagree with that Public figures gets lots of hate no matter what they say Always someone unhappy I just believe we should not focus so much on details like anime avatar and poor choice of words and avoid the points this guy makes It means I could make any stupid statement but with a well written post and that I should be taken more seriously than him Sometimes emotions can get the best of us and we say things in an inappropriate ways
https www reddit com r starcraft comments 432r1o richard lewis responds to critics over the 1 czf4eys
Fair points on that new WCS system But I still strongly disagree with Thorin saying that it s pretty much impossible to be a fan and not watch top level korean players
Yeah like the part where he talks about multiple examples of people watching teams that aren t the best and still are true fans of the sport that criticism was so bull shit I mean if you re not watching the best football team clearly you hate the sport I m being facetious of course because your comment is a perfect description of your own comment
I simply lay out why someone like RL would respond the way he did If you don t agree that the whole comment is worded absolutely horrible then i won t be able to convince you either way
Is there somewhere I can catch up on the recent drama or can someone give a brief rundown haven t followed the scene that much recently and really don t get it
There is a bunch of people who hate recent WCS changes and they are actively pushing their agenda that not liking the best of the best Koreans Not liking starcraft which more reasonable people dismiss as bullshit because you know following this logic people who are not rooting for top teams in every sport are not really fans of that sport
We can disagree with WCS change because of banning of Korean without disagreeing against lock of some competitions Blizzard would have continue WCS Premier League fully locked and let Koreans having access to DH IEM etc that LOT of people me included would have been happy It is possible to let some space to foreigners without hurting koreans But Blizzard decided to crush one to try to get the other that s why ppl are angry
Look my comment was not about that I was only saying that notion not liking korean starcraft not liking starcraft is bullshit Thats it No need to bring another round of WCS argument in here
Correction not liking korean starcraft not liking best starcraft
One thing you should know is that sports and competition are fundamentally elitist
Why the condescending tone Yes they are but we are talking about fans here not sports players and sportsmanship
That would be correct but Thorin and RL are not saying this
Basically Blizzard made it so that if you were born in South Korea you have a substantially harder time becoming a successful starcraft player
Laughable There so many more opportunities in Korea than anywhere else Losing access to a few tournaments dies not change that fact
Now you re just making stuff up There are more tournaments in the foreign scene and you have way easier competition
How many team house outside of Korea How many B level players live off the game in Korea They have proleague GSL SSL and various Kespa cup and the like tournaments There are also still various WCS Global events in the horizon No I am not making this up You simply have blinders on
The B teamers are broke What do you consider living off the game GSL and SSL are twice a year SSL is only ro16 kespa cup and the like tournaments Grasping at straws You re just assuming they will add tournaments They ve announced nothing including WCS global events Now add up all the tournaments foreigners have The mental gymnastics you are doing to justify this is pretty impressive
They chose to go into a niche profession in the first place Everybody wants to a star in hollywood film or be on tv but only a few actually make it Is it the governments job to keep funding movies for them Playing sc2 is a like any passion profession you have a side job to support yourself till you make it
Tell that to the foreigners getting charity points
An NA based company like blizzard trying to make sure its NA scene is still there Who knew Why do you get to decide who blizzard donates to anyways make your own damn charity
NA scene still doesn t exist moron Now euros will just dominate WCS instead of Koreans
Free room and board That s what B teamers get That would s living off the game Is it a spectacular life That s up to them What do foreign players get There really is no arguing that with you I am talking about the good of the game You are coming from a selfish viewer perspective Maybe try this then I am out why do you have your job Isn t there someone somewhere maybe even in Korea that could do it better Should all jobs be given to the worlds best Or should people be allowed to work and make a living where they live Anyway I said good day sir
So many new unknown korean players breaking out by winning an iem lol
Do you have a team of writers to help you come up with this bullshit or are you just that good
First remaxs and now unfiltert goes to shit again Normally I watch ever show but this one I have to skip But we need at least one show so I lower my pitchfork
Honestly this episode is a must watch Sure there s quite a bit of StarCraft bashing as no one could retort or defend anything Thorin said but it was interesting and it s always good to see other people s point of view whether it s serious sarcastic mean or not
Can someone just organize a unfiltired showdown Thorin and Richard lewis vs Destiny and huk
R lewis dota community got rekt by them CSGO community got rekt by them SC2 community getting rekt pending
It s just the CS GO mentality It s not meant viciously they are just more the bro type As a player of both games for 15 years I personally have always enjoyed the SC people a lot more We are more cerebral but at the same time pedantic Whereas CS people are just emotionally unstable and always having to assert their dominance Obviously a sweeping generalisation
Hey now CS GO peeps are our friends most of them anyway Don t let Thorin and RL make you think otherwise
Yeah the cs go community in general respects sc2
It s not meant viciously Obviously a sweeping generalisation I m a member of both I also said Starcraft people were pedantic but you guys had no issue haha
tbf if you have an anime avatar your opinion is worthless
Whats the name of your waifu
Says the guy with the name UranusIsBestAnus
Wow more than one waifu huh Hope they re at least pure virgins who will love you forever
Speaking as a person with an anime avatar everyone knows it s bad to generalize but the observation is still statistically relevant
Thorin layed out the truth and it seems to be hurting so when someone can t fathom the truth they don t really deserve that serious of a reply so nothing wrong here really
Ok Thorin style Get fucked eat a dick
If someone disagree with Thorin he can t be taken seriously Fanboyism at it s finest Come on I like Thorin too but it doesn t mean I have to agree blindly to everything he says and believe people that does not share his point of view are worthless shits
Again they aren t a SC2 fans they just happen to like celebrities that happen to play SC2 if they are only interested in european american players
thats complete bullshit and you probably know it so we have to choose now only koreans or only foreigners O o the example with football the real FOOTball teams is quite good many people cheer for a bad team or the underdog simply because they like them they are fans i watch both koreans foreigners and i consider myself a sc2 fan your pov is so messed up you are acting like one of the sides korean sc2 is disappearing or it s either the korean side or the foreigner side one could cheer for
That s not a fair statement at all A TON of people prefer college basketball to the NBA even though the talent disparity is huge
That s because their claim is 100 bullshit It s literally nothing but a No True Scotsman Fallacy presented as a legitimate argument
Tell someone rooting for a NA team in CSGO pro scene that they re not true fans because EU is where the best teams are
There is a difference between rooting for NA team and rooting for NA team and only watching them You can root for your team but if you don t look at the EU teams at all you are again a fanboy who is only interested in the players not the game itself
Well if you get interested in players it means you re interested in the game first Why would I root for a SC2 player if I don t care about the game at all I watched a lot of games over the years SC2 was released and top korean level games were not always the best entertainment wise foreigners showed a lot of good stuff too over the years Why should people only root for the bests There s many reasons to why I root for a player and not the other Skill playstyle personnality etc Aligulac ranking is not everything Why looking at the game from one perspective makes you a fan and the other not
Yup cowboys fan check out xD
I gotta say I love a bit of drama I think it s what keeps the scene alive tbh
hey on the other hand maybe he means he will go check out that sweet looking anime
tbf the post IS quite retarded
debate It s a OPINION SHOW no
I m a happy 19 year old who happens to love anime Nothing you will say will make me think otherwise on Naruto one piece bleach SAO SnK KLK other mainstream garbage The only good shounens are GTO HxH and maybe one or two others I only torrent my anime because I m not a peasant I actually appreciate quality and never stream any of my shows Crunchyroll supports babbys first anime Naruto I csnt support something that appeals to so nerdy XD kids who think Naruto is edgy I go to hot topic to see what shows to not watch I m not supporting a show that appeals to that crowd Even though I m pirating it I m not wasting space on my 7 hard drives for garbage I d rather take a shit on my hard drive then take up space with shounen shit I got in an argument with someone at barns and Noble in the Manga section because I was putting Naruto in the garbage where it belongs I m not allowed in the mall again and I m not going back because they appeal to the crowd of Naruto
I swear Doc I own an international team of video gamers
Our main game is StarCraft Doc We started in StarCraft yeah right rofl
I love this Root flair Whenever i see it i know its Catz
Literally can t be anyone else
See Even Catz thinks so
I mean you could just read his name nam sayin
starcraft is not rocket science
What he is saying is if you are starting a new org your first game should probably be one of the bigger titles I know nothing about running an org but I assume it s easier to get sponsors if your brand is seen by 100k then if your brand is seen by 20k
somewhat related Obviously this is the plaintif s version of events But there were some infiltration experiments like the Rosenhan experiment that indicated that by and large if you come with a claim that is only slightly unusual they don t bother to check it and just rule it a delusion I mean 95 of the time they re probably right but still
that is terrifying
Then the world is terrifying because this stuff happens everywhere I m sure they check the first couple of times but after a while you just start slacking off Happens every time once your job becomes routine After a while you just get tired of continually performing a routine check which 95 of the time results in the same answer so you slack of Rosenhan experiment was hilarious though suddenly a guy writing a letter to his mother becomes neurotic note taking because the psych didn t bother to check the contents of what the patient was writing Also I m pretty sure no one ever bothers to check my signature when I sign things because I just put an arbitrary scratch down and don t really have a real signature and that never seemed to hinder me in life whatsoever I signed many contracts without really having a signature and it seems to work
I believe the quote goes if you are not terrified then you do not know what is going on But the idea of indefinite imprisonment and forced chemical imprisonment on a whim terrifying Even more so than black sites a la Gitmo because there you remain yourself Antipsychotics will do a number on you if you are supposed to take them they fundamentally change how the brain works But I have the feeling I am far more worried about being snatched and put in to a mental ward then you do so to each their own
Oh believe me I know all about being snatched and put into a mental ward My point is more that mental wards are not unique in this kind of sloppy stuff it happens everywhere Even worse innocent people are incarcerated and quite often it turns out that it was due to clear and avoidable human error some exculpatory evidence that would ve cast a serious doubt on the prosecution just didn t get through when it should The entire world is a scary place so to speak
I did and I know what I would do it would not be helpful
If your psych hospital is committing individuals without psychiatric illness it s because you have bad psychiatrists It s honestly not too difficult to determine whether or not someone is malingering had some sort of drug induced episode or has a true illness Further as long as you don t represent a harm to yourself or others which essentially means you re eating drinking and don t have suicidal or homicidal ideation you can t be involuntarily held Just because you have hallucinations and or delusions doesn t mean you can be held We ve had plenty of individuals with schizophrenia bipolar depression etc leave AMA and we couldn t really stop them The only thing we could legally do was try to convince them they still needed to stay to get better or at least ask them to take their meds at home
Well I have been beaten raped and drowned before so I feel better equipped to deal with that trauma
Here s hoping you ll never have to deal with either in the future
I lost to a 12 pool drone pull once
Rosenhan and the other experimenters didn t make a slightly unusual claim they claimed to be suffering from auditory hallucinations I e they deliberately faked having a psychotic disorder Also nobody gets held against their will just for one delusional psychotic symptom any more It has to be shown that you are a danger to yourself or others The Obama thing was definitely not the only thing that landed this woman in confinement
I honestly find it a little strange that people expect it to go differently Do people honestly think that a human being can be trained to diagnose medical conditions without the benefit of some objective hard instrument Especially things as vague as psychiatric disorders when all the biases come into play Did you know that the same transcript with a picture of a white man on top of it makes psychs diagnose autism more but with a black man aggression disorders more Gee It s almost like psychiatrists are not superhuman and guilty of the biases and praeconceptions that everyone is
Why couldn t they just look at her twitter wtf
Time is money and helping other people I guess I had a clinical psychologist at university against my will Second conversation with her she enquired as to my relationship with my fellow students Which was disastrous so I just said something like I hate them they hate me the only difference is that they feel some kind of entitlement to study and work with people whom they like you re not here for pleasure for her to then spin it into some kind of paranoid delusion for me to coerce her into admitting that she never checked whether or not they hate me and my finally saying Gee maybe you people contribute to the paranoia by pulling this crap If you re just going to do that then people who are paranoid will assume you re in on it
that article makes it sound like the people at the mental ward raped that woman thats i can t find the words right now
12 days Is this the record for the quickest team to form and disband
Even apex lasted longer 20 days SMH http www teamliquid net forum closed threads 373580 apex esports a new starcraft 2 team is born
Apex never 4gate
Legend announced a team and never actually formed it is that like 1 days
You must be a C programmer
I thought for sure this was an esportsexpress headline
I read that as esport sex press and I was slightly confused
Thats the point
That was my initial reaction too
When you pick a name like Apocalypse eSports you re kind of setting yourself up for a bad ending
Welp there goes my idea for starting up Implosion Self Immolation eSports
should ve dropped the implosion Self Immolation eSports has a better ring to it
No check the initials that he put in caps
nice i didn t see that before
hail ISIS
Damnit I ve self immolated again D
brb off to start hot girlie harem eSports
This shit just writes itself
I swear to god even if I sat down and tried to come up with a satirical piece it wouldn t be as good as this
LOL How many teams has this owner gone through now
I believe just 2 but the former he didnt have any control over this was his own fuckin joke lol
Yeah He was a CEO with no power at all honest
Oh for fuck s sakes this one didn t even try
Hey psych ward though That is a new one Keepin it fresh
ahahah
Kappa
Well of course you first need to announce it before you can disband it
The hard hitting question is when he was admitted to the psych ward before or after starting the team

thank you
Golden Vid
Oh boy where s that PR idiot that I was arguing with when the team announced they had formed He swore the team was so legit and amazing and I was dumb for not supporting them I figured it would last about a month so I guess I was wrong about something
You re looking for either u MediKing but more likely u AGZailyn Amusingly AGZailyn was the person the article mentions as being the Whistleblower Among the quotes AGZailyn So let me get this right Because you don t have our personal financial figures that makes it a sketchy source of money All of our players have looked over and signed contracts There I said it the magical word Blah blah blah other scam teams have contracts too Gasp Who knew A contract in eSports is essentially designed to protect the PLAYER If the team fails to meet their agreed compensation package the player is not responsible to do ANYTHING ELSE for the team
https www reddit com r starcraft comments 41453k new team apocalypse esports signs welmu desrow cyzgqdb took less than a month
To be fair the team last a few days longer than I expected it to
Did you pick your name from tokyo ghoul There is a rize
So Aldaris has finally been committed
Let s see u MrMarathonMan
Nope
sheeeeeeeeeeeet son
By the way I concede to you in our earlier debate regarding proleague this year it seems they managed to figure things out Well done sir
Now they re viewbotting their own stream D ninja edit ninja is not fast I m not a sir but I feel like one tips fedora
Only someone in a psych ward would pick up desrow on their team
This is insane It almost sounds like a make believe story After three teams they needed a unique way to go down in flames
lmfao what a surprise
Well it kind of is did you predict he d check into a psych ward
Surpriiiiiiise
You really believe that Must have been one of those guys trashing all the negative posts saying this would happen when they announced the team
Well we cant blame Aldaris on this one
The owner is in a psych ward was he in there before or after the team disbanded Did he arrange the whole team from in there How did he get access to a computer and phone to set this all up
There is no way he was there when the team was formed Psych wards have very strict rules about phone use and some don t even have computers to allow internet access This makes sense because you don t really want to help fuel the fire of any of your schizophrenic patients So there s really no mystery Some guy founded a team then ended up getting committed to a psych ward
Who doesn t love Starcraft What other esport has stuff like this Can t make this stuff up
and another one RIP
Anotha one
and anotha one
bites the dust
wrong meme mate
It was funnier than what you were trying to do anyway
well it would have been fine we had done the right lyrics
Well that was quick
That s pretty sad to hear I admit I was a little surprised to see them sign so many players in such a short time
The announcement thread was full of people saying this would happen I really can t believe anyone would be surprised
shits crazy literally
A headline like you d expect from The Onion
Why don t people do their due diligence before getting involved with these types of deals Asking for proof of funding is one of the first things you should do before entering into any kind of agreement How can you sign a contract with a random guy without knowing if they have the money to pay you What ever happened to that esports union I think it s needed because it s pretty clear that people don t know what they re doing
He basically claimed to have a flipped a few housing projects and saved up 100k overtime to start the org up The money wasnt made up it was real it just wasnt his to do with since it was actually his girlfriends health settlement money
I don t know a lot about esport organisations but unless it was a limited company with proof of funding I d be very hesitant to sign any contracts with them It s a very simple thing to set up and it protects both the players and the investor
The contracts were pretty clean so much so that the Owner is being taken up because he didnt pay these players though he signed the contracts So the players are more protected then him
Yeah but they didn t even check that the organisation had any funding I guess they didn t want to look a gift horse in the mouth but it still seems kind of silly to me I understand that players don t always think of these things but the manager really should have done the due diligence How can you recruit players and hire staff without knowing for a fact that you will be able to pay them Proof of funding is business 101
Eh the managers all had a solid backround they were the ones who signed the players the owner just had like a minor skype call with a few of them and as Desrow s vlog said he seemed very fluid and genuine in his talks with them I asked some of the managers and they were skeptical but they felt who would go through all this contracts and all with a deadline of money within 2 weeks and not have it it just seems insane to spend that much effort for a 2 week gig ya know so i understand where they were coming from
I m guessing it wasn t exactly a professional management team so it s understandable that they made mistakes I just hope people will take the right lesson from this and do the right thing next time These situations are very easy to avoid if you know what you re doing you would have thought that someone on the management team had some kind of business or legal background
desrow put a vlog up about it https www youtube com watch v jhFoIDn2LYc feature youtu be a
He just called Quebec a nation because it s so different What a tool I have family in Quebec im half French and it s no fucking different than anywhere else except they speak French and English in bigger cities I always thought people were ignorant when they said they didnt like french Canadians but if more of them think they are so different and should be a nation of their own then I m not surprised none of my family are like this and neither are any people I ve met from there You re not special or different because you are from Quebec get over yourself and start being proud of being fucking Canadian instead of a Quebecer fuck no other province acts like that Sounds like he s a separatist which is completely ridiculous and makes me not like him even more
Just like Taiwanese should be proud of being Chinese right Who are you to dictate it
oh God Tzuyu
Lol you sound like a rational and toughtful person So you go to Quebec occasionnally and suddenly you know more about Quebec and it s culture than the guy who was born and raised there The fact that you failed to realize that Quebec s culture is more of a mindset than an ambience just proves you know very little about it But I guess having an opinion makes me a tool too right
My dad was born and raised there and I visit more than occasionally so go fuck yourself
You re quite the angry person I guess all french canadians are like this
They are
Oh so you are not a frenchie Then how can you know what Quebec is like Hmmm puzzling
I am I was being ironical
I mean I don t see anyone saying they are proud of being from Ontario they just say they are proud of being Canadian Quebec is just so different culturally We have French music French movies French TV shows My pride as a Canadian in nationwars is was as strong as my pride as a French Canadian playing for nG in Dust league and SC2improve team league I really don t see why they can t both co exist I don t believe in Quebec seperating from Canada and it s not something I want
Thanks for the clarification however when I m in Quebec I don t feel much different than when I m anywhere else in Canada from a cultural standpoint but I can see why you would say that
it depends of a few factors first off are you talking about Quebec city or the province of Quebec in general second if you re from Toronto and come to Montreal you won t feel much of a difference except taxes p Montreal has this city of the world aura
The only difference I see when I go to Quebec is that people are obnoxious and they are basically the opposite of like a stereotypical polite Canadian
The real problem is you trying to fit different people in a single stereotype
We ve previously been warned by our savior
Psych ward sounds fishy and awfully convenient to me
This is why we have trust issues
All those community always positive guys who were ripping on people s negativity and pessimism over this new team can now eat shit
But they had a solid 2 year plan Maybe they shoulda started with the bar a little lower 2 week plan maybe
SOLID 2 YEAR PLAN SOLID 2 YEAR PLAN SOLID 2 YEAR PLAN SOLID 2 YEAR PLAN
shit like this really gives us a bad name I hope that wife divorces this idiot
Apparently she s not even his wife according to deSrow
The question is why do players keep falling for this stuff
Because they are desperate enough
Theyre probably desperare its not like theres alot of teams looking for pro players especially sc2 ones
how CAN a player know better lol
low risk low reward why not even if you get some free keyboards and mice and hoodies up front that s better than nothing
Did you think Desrow was very smart The fact that he joined a team bankrolled by some random dude that had no real proof of money and expected a salary shows how stupid he really is
well if you re getting nothing now and were offer to get something aka possibly mostlikely but not and that doesnt cost you a penny to give is a shot would you I mean the guy is playing SC2 all day anyways might aswell sign and risk getting more
because pro starcraft players are all kids
Psych ward What
That went well
That was quick
This is another reason why this subreddit is so very sceptic when another team forms with unknown background Hell even well known people tend to not last very long for various reason This is all in all sad to see
Well that was fast
Well that was fast

I kind of went out of this community and I only check the frontpage of this sub but this this got my attention gears turning
Leave The Memories Alone
why am i not surprised seriously i guess their roster was just that fucking bad
The team s record 12 day existence is obviously pathetic but considering how the post about the team s disbandment has far exceeded the popularity of the post about the its formation makes you wonder if this community just has an infatuation with failure
AHAHHAHAhahaha this is too good
that team lasted almost as long as your average Naniwa
L O L
Any players on that team
Desrow welmu major and somebody else I think
Watching desRows stream Not seen a reaction yet Oh dear I should go buy some popcorn Edit nvm https twitter com desRowfighting status 692574455181230084
Ah Good ole Dessie soldiering on Wonder which unfortunate team if any will sign him next
Did he really think a team would really give him a salary for being such a fucking clown Hahaha Edit downvotes So you guys thought Desrow deserves a salary to play sc2 when he wasn t even good enough to break into premier last year
How would you know about the deal also market value is not closely related with results You could say Oh desrow is the only one with a brand why should anyone else get a salary xd

I am not remotely surprised Sort of sad for the players but not remotely surprised
That kind of shit is driving away fans and players A ded gaemer isn t some edgy truth teller enlightening the uneducated masses about the truth of the state of SC2 Anyone who s still a fan now knows the deal They don t have their head in the sand pretending things are great they re just enjoying what they have now There s really nothing wrong with that QFT
I honestly think a large number of ded gaemers actually want SC2 to die so they try to kill it by claiming it to already be dead
honestly i think most of the people that dont like sc2 have moved on to other games the people spouting ded gaem are probably just still bitter that the games popularity has decreased by such a large scale because they still play it
well its working i still watch starcraft from time to time but im not as much involved as before because i got tired of the ded gaem bullshit it s like having an imperfection or something and having someone keep metioning it We know we ve that imperfection let us just enjoy it for what it is
It s like the bro Tyrion said Let me give you some advice bastard Never forget what you are The rest of the world will not Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you I really don t care about anyone crying ded gaem LoTV is really fun and DH was dope as shit
I like the cut of your jib sir
The ded gaem meme has died out a lot since LotV launched Some people spout it but almost always it gets downvoted into the ground and not spammed much in Twitch
Why do you care so much about what other people say about the game Just enjoy it as you want and don t let other people influence it
i dont like being around negativity as i said i still enjoy the game i m simply not as involved as before portuguese community admin basically built portuguese community managed several teams too some portuguese and copenhagen wolves made Arcade Maps Snipers Promod the first one featured by blizzard Micro Arena etc so ye but i guess the game being completely dead in my country now after all the effort also contributed a lot
Ded gaeming is just a specific example of cynicism It s a psychological defense mechanism Basically you see some problem but you can t see any way to solve it This makes you feel really bad so your mind searches for some way to feel better about it The cynical way to deal with this problem is just to state aloud for everyone to hear that the problem is unsolvable and efforts to solve it are foolishly naive and a waste of effort and energy The mind feels better because this stance justifies its own inability to solve the problem and also gives the mind the chance to be right about it Being right is a powerful mental reward to social animals like us This means that cynics not only don t help solve any serious problems in the world they actively discourage uncynical people from working on those problems and at core it is because they are too psychologically weak to deal with a problem in any other way
It s a conspiracy by LoL players
It s not a conspiracy but there are certainly individual BW fans both here on r starcraft and on random streamchats who love to spread bile about SC2 whenever they can They can be identified as follows 1 Very negative and pessimistic post about something that has to do with SC2 2 Post history includes high interest in another game where mood is enthusiastic 3 Every post on r starcraft is negative about Starcraft and Blizzard except 4 one or more posts where he she reveals a history of playing Broodwar
Yeah I was really just making a joke
epic joke bruh
how could you not tell he was joking lol
How dare you try and inject humour into this discussion
I disagree People left SC2 not because of negativity They also didn t leave because of delusions The only thing here that he says that says ANYTHING about the topic of why he thinks this game failed is It was simply a gaming trend from RTS to not And I think that doesn t do any justice to answering the question of why SC2 failed or what caused the most damage or whatever the hell got him so bothered to write such a blog about ded gamers
I know quite a few people who left because of negativity You are only saying that because from your perspective you wouldn t do it I m pretty sure JP is a good example of someone who left due to negativity and im guessing a lot of players did too
I figured JP left because he couldn t make money rather than the hate that he got Same with many others Basically I see money as the primary motivator more than anything else If people love their game they will stick to it If hate causes them to lose fans so they don t land gigs for the game that s a whole different issue they have to fix But its hate they get from their own personalities not hate on starcraft Completely different
If you left because of negativity you were never a true fan to begin with If people spamming dedgaem Kappa in Twitch chat was keeping you up at night and holding you back from enjoying the game then I have some bad news for you you weren t enjoying the game for different reasons
He also arguably contradicts himself in the paragraph above that one In the paragraph above it he says it s the truth that SC2 is on the decline and that some people just can t handle it And now he says every fan knows the deal in the one below it
I really liked this little piece as well people have been doing this ded gaem thing for years and years they sound so sure about their doomsaying that you might think they each have their own personal crystal ball
Starcraft 2 was huge during 2011 It was the biggest game on Twitch JustinTV by far however League was rapidly catching up Shit I remember watching tournament after tournament MLG Into NASL into Dreamhack into GSL I even went to a Barcraft in Sydney Australia to watch the GTSL and it was awesome However Blizzard didn t strike when the iron was hot and now it s desperately trying to play catch up with games that have eclipsed it Everyone knew the SC2 bubble was going to burst eventually
I remember when we had first broken like 120k at MLG and it was a huge fucking deal I really specifically remember heading into the offseason at the end of 2011 really fucking excited about the future of sc2 and then nothing really came from it
Huge fucking deal you re not wrong there Part of me wonders where the game would be if MLG DH IPL etc didn t let Koreans come over and crush foreigners Edit seriously downvoting me I m sorry if you don t think letting the flood gates open for Koreans so early in SC2s life in foreigner tournaments didn t do irreparable damage to the scene you re fucking delusional
I don t think it was the Koreans at all I really think it was just people moving away from the RTS genre You can t play sc2 with friends like you can play csgo or league or dota You can play these games casually and still have a lot of fun The only way you really have fun in sc2 is if you are winning and to do that you have to play all the fucking time which just isn t possible for a lot of people
Not sure what you mean by The only way you really have fun in sc2 is if you are winning For everybody except maybe high GM winrates always balance around 50 by design IMO that is a problematic belief that needs to be challenged In the end it is incompatible with enjoying any competitive ranked game not just limited to esports
Bottom bronze also doesn t have 50 winrate but that s not the most important detail haha
This may sound pedantic but I think it is an important detail Who is in bottom bronze Newbies the type that you need in order to sustain your game When they have a 20 winrate their first 5 games it s not that surprising that they might put the game down and not pick it back up
I thought leave bots rule the bottom of Bronze
A fair point yes
I think having the ladder be the main focus that caused all the issues bw was so fun because you had constant ums and bgh and casual fun games being hosted all the time that is how people were introduced to the game Christ I played for like 8 months before I realized that money maps were for casuals and there was an even more fun community inside bnet that played normal maps and tried to play the perfect game by improving all the time also found out about korean bw around that time as well
Yeah you have a point Losing made me feel so shitty in sc2 compared to losing in cs or Dota because at least you can kinda blame the lack of team help in those games where losing in sc2 is all on you you lost because the other person was better than you Ladder anxiety got me by the balls
Well the arcade how it is now should have been that way in 2011 That would have definitely kept the casual crowd going Blizzard fucked that one up
back in the BW days i used to play with friends all the time because we had LAN Friends would come over i d have 4 6 computers setup we d spend hours sometimes days just playing starcraft I myself would say not having LAN hurt this game alot Not just for those friendly get togethers never having occured but for all the downtime stoppages at premiere events which are the best times to showcase the game All of these issues people bring up all add up to what have kept this game from reaching its true potential imo
I think there not being LAN is a joke competitively but I don t think it impacted the outcome of sc2 Online matchmaking is EVERYTHING right now The only game that is somewhat popular without it is melee and even that has netplay It just comes down to people not wanting to play and RTS that feels more like you are practicing than playing the game
It wasn t Koreans that killed Starcraft Blizzard doing absolutely nothing to support the scene create infrastructure for the scene refused to try to appeal to a wider audience etc is why SC2 doesn t get 100k viewers for premier tourneys anymore
huge in 2011 is barely huge at all now We remember 2011 it being huge it was huge compared to everything else but other games outgrew it Its not like we had 400k viewers concurrent in 2011 Even when it was huge its nothing compared to the huge games that exist now
Oh no doubt about that but at the time streaming was just becoming a thing I still remember the fight between owned tv and justin tv even though owned seemed to cater for the LoL audience more eSports has become huge now as a fan of many games It s great to see
The starcraft community has been oddly self destructive from the very beginning I remember being mystified at the fan driven movement to tank the original Starcraft II s amazon com ratings back when Wings of Liberty came out in 2010 Never mind that instead of getting three 8 mission games one for each race people were upset that we were getting a 27 mission human campaign with the promise of two more people decided to rage and tank the ratings for their favorite game as if trashing its public ratings would accomplish something
Same thing happened to dota
I recall everyone making jokes about Dota 2 and how everyone s inventory was 50 dota 2 keys
gib diretide
In all seriousness is Dota2 big outside Russia today I go to Twitch to watch the game sorry guys only once or twice I swear and it is usually smaller than Hearthstone in terms of viewers and 90 of streams and viewers are usually Russian When AdmiralBulldog comes on he gets like 20K non russian viewers and when he logs off they all disappear
dota 2 never had a big twitch streaming community you cant judge the size of a game by twitch viewer count especially not dota 2 you cant ignore the fact that the CLIENT BASED INGAME LIVESTREAM of ALL tournaments and ongoing events rakes in high viewer counts that are nowhere displayed watching on twitch is actually way less comfortable than watching ingame dota 2 still has a growing community and cracks the record of concurrent players online repeatingly there are some twitch personalities people are going to switch on their browser stream for same as for tournaments but besides that there is just no reason to use twitch i think its kind of a worrying trend if you take twitch as absolute scale for the size of a game dota 2 is healthier than ever and hasnt even reached its peak yet every year the compendium prize pool sets new records and there are TONS of updates new features going on i honestly think you underestimate how big dota 2 in reality is and how much it is growing
Every international has broken worldwide prizepool records year on year Every single one Even TI5 which came after a lacklustre and uninspiring TI4 finals Dota 2 is presently the most played game on Steam with over 922 000 concurrent players right this minute In comparison CS GO peaked at 606 000 today and presently has under 500 000 Right now on Twitch Dota 2 has a little over half of League s viewer numbers making it the second most popular game on twitch In terms of individual streamers yes there are a lot of russians but right now there are 13 000 people watching a guy from California compared to the 2 streamer who is russian Dota s popularity is in a very good place Also anecdotal evidence for me seems to say that russian monopoly on Dota viewership is moving slowly downwards 2GD is the host for the next Major and the community is super hyped about it I m seeing less and less russians in my games and so on
I d also point out that the lower instance of sponsorship is largely because of Dota 2 being a free to play game with microtransactions and a huge userbase That means that being supported as a streamer with personal donations is more achievable than it ever was in SC2 where even peak viewership IdrA would never have been able to subsist on donations alone

It s biggest in CIS that s for sure But the steaming is very very personality based People are either gonna watch Bulldog Sing Arteezy or nobody 10 years since Puppey strim
For big lans like the Majors it s usually pretty equal between the Russian and English treams about 70 100k each Idk about individual streamers I really only watch Bulldog and sometimes RTZ
You are downvoted but you are right Dota is smaller than Hearthstone in term of viewers http blog twitch tv 2015 12 top games for november 2015 fallout 4 vaults into top 5

To add some useless credentials to this post I m a game designer and I ve thought tons and tons about this question and the conclusion I always come to is that the argument x game is just too hardcore for the casuals argument is just wrong in most cases In the case of Starcraft 2 I can think of so many things Starcraft 2 could have done just straight forward better and I m 100 sure it would have had a bombastically larger casual draw as a result while not sacrificing any of its core values I have so much anecdotal evidence from dozens of friends and acquaintances who are so casual I doubt they could ever make it out of Wood league but they greatly enjoyed the game competitively for a while until various clearly solvable issues pushed them off the game Just to rattle some high level ideas off in a single block of text Better way for bad players to improve be it via alternate game modes or more meaningful rewards for doing certain things like don t get supply blocked and reach 200 supply before x minutes blizzard could have been the one to introduce skins a marketplace for it and something like Dota 2 s compendium but frankly they re just not good at having those kind of ideas and actually implementing them in a timely manner adjust the game design to make it more interesting and challenging for players while making it less frustrating for new players in short remove MULE inject larvae chrono boost and don t worry about the APM requirement high level players will use it for micro and more perfect macro sim city whatever Alternatively put something else in the game that ups APM requirement like more harassing units that require attention to control like reapers they could ve not fucked up battle net really it was a barebones platform for the vast majority of its lifetime and stuff like clans clan levels like you had in WC3 automated tournaments chat channels and an actually functioning custom game system and all the usual stuff should have been in the game from the very beginning as in day 0 not patched in slowly over the span of 5 years there s just really no excuse for that not a technical one not a budget one OK I m gonna stop writing now but I could literally keep writing for ages here Really it s saddening to think about the potential the game has and Blizz botched it It s probably not too late to change all of this but lets face it Blizz takes ages to implement literally anything we will all die before SC2 reaches its potential The only thing some of us can hope is that Blizzard learned its lesson for Warcraft 4 I realize many people will forever prefer Starcraft
Do not bother people in this subreddit community are like racing horses got pairs of blinkers equipped
Hey mate nice seeing you again Why are you still here
There are still some people who have a slight chance to recognize their own ignorance I want to believe And to have fun of the rest of course
I m glad you think you can change Keep up the good fight
I agree with you and would like to continue the discussion elsewhere But there is one large industry trend that seems to effect Sc2 RTS s in general are far far less popular than before
Excellent post I agree with every point I would like to add that it irritates me how SC2 players hate League of Legends so much even though LoL does take skill despite what someone that has never played it might think If they want to take out their pitforks hate on Hearthstone please That game is ridiculous and it s more popular than SC2
Now this is the truth Honest and beautiful
It s the truth and it hurts We just need to look in a mirror to see where the problem lies
In the mirror Nah I think you misunderstand The heading is a bit misleading as it sounds like it s giving part support to dedgamers which it definitely does not The article encourages us to lay the hype phase behind us and start enjoying SC2 as fans without positive or negative delusions HotBid is NOT saying that the community is being delusionally positive right now but that the delusional positivity of the past 2011 is why we have these bitter dedgamers spreading bile today What the article is about is the transition to a post hype phase of SC2 where we just enjoy the game for what it is Obviously if we enter into a post hype phase of SC2 part of the deal will be to be slightly delusionally positive about the game like fans of all things are soccer icehockey music genres etc It s fairly obvious that most of us who are left behind as fans of SC2 five years after release are people who are fans of the RTS genre of 1v1 multitasking of the players and who think that high APM RTS is an awesome way to use a computer and many of us inevitably find MOBAs Hearthstone etc kind of simple in comparison TL DR The article is not about trying to criticize an ongoing delusional positivity in SC2 at this point It is talking about establishing a matured fan culture around SC2
Yea you pinpoint the exact type and period of positivity that was toxic for the community What i see today is highlighting aspects that make the game great appeals for change that will make the game better with far less emotion and more analytical perspective Also there is a difference with the dialogue that Blizzard has with the community now Rather than just implementing change or ignoring it And as for the negativity it is still there but nothing like it was before
This was a great comment and I feel happier for reading it Thank you
I don t think this article is about people who play arcade games or singleplayer but people who watch and enjoy competitive SC2
Yeah but a healthy custom map community draws in new players and some of those eventually transition to competitive melee like in Brood War If we re talking about the popularity of StarCraft II you can t ignore the role of the Arcade as a gateway drug
No need to hurt That is the whole point Just enjoy the game that you love Just enjoy the players and the tournaments Be grateful for a having a good scene and LotV showing a lot of promise Live and let live
https www youtube com watch v retK1rz zcM this video illustrates this situation It s like it was made for us p The Boss BroodWar Big Boss SC2 Snake Us the community
Yeah great read
The truth What just because its Hotbid SC2 could have been more than what is is now Saying that it was too hard or not focused on casuals enough is the same kind of talk people use to cope with the fact that the game has declined greatly Its no different than the meh ded gamers he describes It overlooks all the attempts and failures and adjustments and tries to save SC2 To me Hotbid simply describes the fact that he s resigned to cope with where SC2 has headed He s trying to be accepting of the game rather than be positive or be negative He never directly answers the question of what did more damage He just says its inevitable like its some sort of genre movement To me that s a shitty answer
It isn t a shitty answer SC2 just isn t the type of game that is easy to get into The market is filled with games that just appeal to a wider audience because they are based on more accessible types of gameplay I m teaching a friend of mine to play in archon mode right now I really underestimated how long it takes to get to the parts of Starcraft that make you realize how great of a game it is It wasn t as simple as I thought it would be at all He constantly texts me to play now after getting over the hump The core concepts are difficult and the game is wonky when they aren t done well This was true for BW as well But it isn t a design problem on SC2 s part that causes this especially after LotV the comparatively intense learning curve is a necessity for this type of game It s a tad naive to think that the SC2 community was going to stay large when there are alternatives that are simpler and give immediate gratification It comes down to the vocal community s false sense of self importance surrounding ded gaem It s almost laughable to see people attribute that to a mass decline Anyone who got driven away by that was going to leave anyways look at every other game s shitty community The SC2 community does make it uniquely difficult for their personalities in the name of growing SC2 The community dishes out a lot of hatred for example all the bitching done when people started coming back for LotV That much is true but it still isn t causing massive player viewer declines The best thing the community can do for SC2 is to ask themselves whether they like Starcraft or not If they like it then they should simply stop giving a fuck about how many people play watch it There are enough of those people to keep the scene running as is SC2 doesn t need saving That doesn t mean people shouldn t bitch when they percieve issues with the game They just shouldn t bitch from the perpective of the game s growth The majority of the decline is about genre He s accepting that because it s reality
I don t think anyone ever denied SC2 declined in popularity compared to LoL Dota and CS The reason people get annoyed with people spamming dead game is because it s pointless negativity Why bother other than to rustle the fans jimmies Everyone knows it s declined but we still watch what we have We don t think it s gonna be 1 or something we just get tired of hearing people bash it
That is exactly what the article says yes
The article acts like people were delusionally positive It s wrong people knew the game wasn t 1 The entire thing is kinda off on its premise
His premise is that some people were delusionally positive and the fact that other games are bigger makes them jealous Just look at some old comments this is true
Don t think there was anyone out there saying SC2 is more popular than LoL Everyone who was SC2 fans were well aware where we stood in the hierarchy of e sports The thing he s referring to is the ded gaem people that trolled Reddit for a solid few months No one really thought SC2 would die it just wasn t the king like it used to be Both sides are misrepresented is all
There were people in the early days that thought sc2 could be and then when it started losing popularity they were losing there minds Also there was a shit ton of negativity toward league in WoL too some of which is still here
I think what did and still does the most damage to SC2 is the infrequent updates to the game from Blizzard Balance patches take forever and underdeliver No content patches as seen in other games and even Diablo 3 which also has an expansion New features are talked about forever but always late never delivered or underdelivered Blizzard refuses to acknowledge a large part of the community feedback This has bettered a bit with the LotV beta but still doesn t go very far Their listening to community feedback needs to stop being listening to whining and outcry but rather deliberating over some of the extremely thorough design discussions which have been demonstrated in the past Look at how much Valve continues to deliver with updates and the frequency they do it with Dota 2 and CSGO Look at how Blizzard themselves delivered with fixing Diablo 3 SC2 updates are laughable in comparison
couldn t agree more
I agree the expectations were very high but I d identify gaming trends design accessibility as bigger factors in affecting SC s popularity DOTA LOL CS GO perhaps only because they re team based games have far more unpleasant people in game at least when I play them I don t find the SC community any more negative toxic than theirs they too have people balance whining complaints about design etc People still compare CS GO with CS 1 6 the same way people compare SC2 and broodwar It s just how gaming communities are and it hasn t prevented those games from being popular esports in terms of viewership In the end it was likely just about accessibility a lot of people play those games so they watch those games too So perhaps SC is just not an easy game to get into or it s a niche thing maybe RTS always has been I agree with the general thrust of the post but I just want to point out that negativity in the community doesn t prevent games from being popular It may even be indicative of the opposite If people complain at least it shows they care otherwise they d just walk away
The relentless positivity was there from the beginning when you have the old boys club repeating ad nauseam that sc2 is the super duper best game ever and then after a whlie of release it becomes clear that it s not when bl infestor is popular and other games are becoming way more popular then a counterjerk was inevitable
So what is your point besides showing how this could have been applied to csgo
That what eventually happened with CSGO could potentially happen with SC2 if only Blizzard gave a fuck This is the same argument as years ago that we saw on SotG only now with a shitty defeatist attitude
Destiny gets it as usual I m not sure why this kind of thing is so hard for people to understand Hell Destiny is the poster child for bringing shit like this to light He s done it every year and a half or so since the game came out I m not even sure why there s still discussion on this blizzard is the EA of strategy games
csgo is only popular because of gambling it s a bubble that will burst
I don t think that you got it
If anything it got it popularity through skins gambling but the people is there to stay even if it gets removed
Except his entire argument is about genre and FPS is a popular genre across multiple franchises and platforms If there were another popular game in the RTS genre then your argument might make some sense But there isn t Can you name a popular console RTS Can you name an RTS that is popular on PC that isn t Starcraft So switching the genre name around doesn t make any sense There are plenty of popular FPS games if CS GO didn t make it there would still be CoD Destiny Halo etc that are still wildly popular franchises even if they aren t that big esports wise especially with the PC crowd
the people who care more about turning starcraft in to a great career rather than a great game
The community had little to do with the fall of SC2 It was mostly because of Blizzard Tournaments and teams to some extent Blizzard fighting with kespa and forcing WCS but most of all their lack of investment in the game Tournaments for spending way too much in 2011 and going under IPL NASL and MLG Teams also for mismanagement
I don t understand why we can t enjoy the tournament players and game that we have now People are so obsessed with the future and numbers that when SC2 actually dies they will miss it and ask yourself why I was bitching instead of enjoying it I will say fuck you when that happens I will tell you to go play the whatever brainless pay to win game that the kids will be all playing in their iPhones Meanwhile I would be rejoicing myself with the memory of having experienced the best video game ever made
Why are we harping on delusional positivity today For as long as anyone could remember reddit s upvote system unfairly weights car flipping window smashing emotionally driven ideas rather than um more thought out ideas The end result is that r starcraft is such a well of negativity that it long ago assumed that this was normal and now is incredibly suspicious of any viewpoint that isn t the most negative conspiracy laden viewpoint out there This has admittedly gotten worse over time as all the complainers drove away everyone more level headed and the mods worse than doing absolutely nothing protected this system as much as they could leading to r starcraft being what it is today
Except were not just talking about r starcraft here kinda talking about the entire community
Nope Blizzard s fault Game separated in 3 parts both costing the same splitting the player base IS ALWAYS BAD Battle net 2 0 was a step backwards in every way custom games chat rooms etc Licensing bullshit for organizing tournaments INCREDIBLY slow updates and I m not talking gameplay how about fixing them numerous UI issues which took them what 5 years The post merge Blizzard doesn t deserve this community but people stuck with SC2 for better or worse in hopes of it eventually realizing its potential It s getting there but i m afraid it might be too late
Exactly people over inflate the importance of community No one gets into a game because of the community they get into a game because it s fun Look at all the undertale shit posts online if I had never played the game before I don t think I d be interested in it now I ve never in my life seen a gaming community that was beaming with positivity or what have you and think wow I really want to spend money to join that coummunity SC2 just isn t that great as a game the writing is terrible and the campaign story is terrible and full of useless retcons Battle net 2 0 was less intuitive had less features and more bullshit This sub places waaaay to much importance on the community Look at LoL an absolute terrible community in nearly every regard but the esports seen is doing
Underrated post
It s quite obviously too late Lotv didn t grow the scene at all and if launch didn t do it then it s not gonna happen post launch with no more expansions to come But maybe that s just the way it s supposed to be it s still big enough that we have wcs gsl and many other pro tournaments to watch so just embrace what we have now instead of being preoccupied with wanting it to get bigger when there s no evidence that will happen
A lot of people including myself have come back with LotV release It s a way better game now imo
I m just perpetually butthurt about Blizzard ever since Activision merge Though yeah not much left to do but enjoy it as long as it lasts
Yeah seriously The expansion pack model is so moronic
Yep missing a point I was talking about multiplayer Splitting player base in a MP game is a shitty decision
It s common practice in the industry BW W3 WoW Civ5 Sins of a Solar Empire All games that I play ed all with active multiplayer all limit you to what xpac you re on Nobody ever said about any of them they could ve been so much more if the devs didn t split the player base Even if the games weren t standalone it s still 60 for the complete trilogy In no way overpriced or any kind of barrier keeping the game s popularity low You can barely call it splitting when such a small percentage of the player base play exclusively on the WoL or HotS ladder What s tying the community together is more than what 1v1 ladder we re playing on it s more than r starcraft TL or the Blizz forums It s being able to play with our friends it s the professional scene it s the campaign it s the Arcade And seriously we re have our fair share of extremely toxic people and you re giving this community the one Blizzard doesn t deserve way too much credit
If it s common doesn t mean it s good Plenty of people said that but most of them just left without saying a word Now it is they tried to redeem the whole situation with LotV by making it the only one you need to play MP the rest are just campaign packs now and some cosmetic nonsense Which is nice obviously but a tad too late Well as i mentioned above some people just quit quite a few more quit after buying the expansion itself mostly because it s a sham 7 units and zerg campaign for the price of the full game thanks but no thanks I know BW was like 30 at a time too but at least it s campaign was brilliant compared to SC2 that is and pro scene was getting bigger not to mention that custom games community was rapidly growing So i got the 30 value out of it and then some Can t say the same about HotS Arcade is not tying anything it s dead Pro scene is on it s way out and no one really cares about 1x1 anymore Which is a shame really since game is finally good now I ll elaborate on 1x1 issue I used to play on a platinum level which was the best one you could get initially in WoL unless i m mistaken and my main incentive for doing it besides game being new and me liking starcraft in general was a possibility of getting into the semi pro scene and perhaps even becoming a pro eventually I won a couple of small tournaments made a bit of cash like 400 or so and then everything came to a halt The game stagnated meta was figured out no updates numerous issues being ignored DESPITE said community pointing them out and providing detailed reports on how to reproduce a bug or even fix the whole thing That s when custom games could hold the playerbase intact for enough time before expansion came out but alas Blizzard dropped the ball in this regard too Arcade is still quite wonky but in WoL it was AWFUL And again people pointed out what was wrong and how to fix it yet nothing changed and some just had enough at that point and started leaving You could argue that it was a good time to break into the scene but why would you do it if game was on such a decline for like year or year and half HotS came out 3 years after WoL there was no growth Not a single person i used to play with in WoL either IRL friends or new ones i v met on b net is playing right now You might call it a narrow point of view but as i see it compared to say Dota or CS GO and many other competitive team based games only a small amount of people used to play Starcraft ladder 1x1 for just fun and were content with where they are in terms of skill and placement
Yeah no I never said that game was dead it s dying though However during WoL SC2 was consistently top3 on twitch tournaments were running all the time it was on a verge of getting pretty big it was up to Blizzard to take it over the line but they didn t The whole RTS is not a popular genre is bullshit and you know it Any game can be popular all you need is solid core gameplay marketing not to mention Blizz and SC brand recognition and infrastructure for scene to grow in If anyone Blizzard had every opportunity to make this into reality but they didn t That was my point from the get go and that s why this game is dying now It s a shame but what can you do
Irrelevant Ded gaem and the delusional positivity came as a result of the quality of the game itself Blizzard has done the most damage to SC2
The more the community figure that brings this type of stuff up is pro blizzard the more they will blame everyone else It s been the same since the Incontrol Idra days They got where they got by building a career out of blizzard and don t want to let go So they ll just find the community to scapegoat
They don t want to update too fast because players need time to learn how to defeat certain op strategies only saying this because they are literally saying the same shit right now
People have been obsessing over viewer numbers for many years even back when SC2 was the big dog but obviously then it was in a positive way Region lock or not people will continue to obsess As for the idea that region lock will increase viewership if it will be the case it s not going to happen overnight I d guess the earliest we could start assuming things would be at Blizzcon where we can see if the storylines built through the year with the foreigner vs Korean angle will actually make a difference Maybe even Blizzcon is too soon and we have to look at next year for people who lost interest gradually give the scene another shot or maybe they wont no one knows Regardless if people think region lock will help or not it s pretty clear that Blizzard has jumped down this rabbit hole now and it s probably too late to try to climb out We just have to see where it takes us and if it s going to be for better or worse
To be honest all the negativity ded gaem spammers are only a small subset of Sc2 viewers The majority of fans are not involved in these drama and simply tune into tournaments once in a while Blizzard was simply incompetent with handling sc2 s esports scene This was a major corporation s first attempt at pushing a RTS esport outside of Korea There were a lot of mistakes made since WOL beta and Blizzard was just not prepared to handle a massive sc2 esports scene There was no experience no infrastructure no proper monetization strategy Sc2 failed because ultimately the company behind it could not make it work People on this subreddit can hate all they want but simple decisions from Blizzard Dingit anyone can kill or raise tens of thousands of viewers So really the power to drive Sc2 s success lies in Blizzard I don t think this is the end of RTS Sc2 is just one RTS game It is very possible that some future company will develop a new RTS that better caters to a competitive scene
Not having WCS region locked from beginning was the biggest mistake with handling the esports part It just needed some time to show because there was so much hype at the beginning and it took a while for the Koreans to figure that they can milk a cash cow by sucking dry other regions Viewership and telent suffered no we here But the best thing is we are still here and our niche is pretty strong Now we got a Region lock and a fresh and fucking entertaining game Plus alot of mods and stuff for new players and more to come SC2 is at it s best spot since the great decline and rise of MOBAs and shooters It s a good time for SC2 lets just enjoy it already instead of having this stupid conversations
LoL CSGO HS is easy to start hard to master Even LoL HS is F2P In many case you need money to win in HS SC2 is hard to start hard to master It costs 40 to enjoy multiplayer No matter how Blizzard makes this game better situation won t change as long as SC2 is full priced real time strategy game
Wasn t the starter edition supposed to address this very issue It doesn t include multiplayer matchmaking but custom games with friends works fine and you also get co op
Yeah the Starter Edition also comes with full access to the Arcade and if you join a party with someone who owns the game you can play match made team games together It basically includes everything except a campaign 1V1 matchmaking and a few co op commanders
Mostly accurate but I d also say that SC2 got more and more noob unfriendly as the game got older The main reason SC2 is so hard compared to LoL Dota CS GO HS is the much higher amount of multitasking required But early on people complained that the game was too easy and that maps were too small and I feel like responding to that feedback caused Blizzard to make a game that required even more multitasking even from new players People complained that in early WoL you just had to make a 2 base deathball and 1 a but even requires more multitask ability than other esports Now the difficulty of the game is even worse But mostly HotBid was right even a game that didn t increase in difficulty from early WoL would have faded as newer more accessible games became available
The game should be difficult the problem is there was really nothing to cater to casuals bw was 90 ums bgh and Blizzard made a game that was mainly focused on ladder and skill the arcade was complete shit at that time so the casuals were forced to ladder and get fucking owned and forever bronze because they didn t play enough and just wanted to have fun The game isn t fun when you suck and lose all the time especially when you are just trying to fuck around and have a good time
The game is actually much easier now Pluck a random masters player from here now and throw him back to 2010 and he ll get crushed in plat There are way more safety nets now
Been reading lots of different posts here over the last few weeks and it has me wondering if sc2 was f2p instead of its current business model would changes come faster Because currently you pay upfront for the game you play the game and if you dont like it you leave Bliz already has your money so does it really care if you leave With f2p it means if your players leave you lose money which as a business they really care about I m not flaming or bashing I m just curious about it
If SC was free to play it would be the hackers driving people away Thankfully as it is now they re just an occasional nuisance or perpetual if you re Avilo
Fucking hacker Proceeds to watch replay and find no evidence of hacks Fucking stream sniper
Yeah pretty much I can t even remember how many times I ve seen this exact scenario play out The truth is that hacking is a non issue Because a it doesn t happen nearly as much as people think it does and b there is a thing called MMR ensures that you will always win approximately 50 of your games unless you are either really good or really bad at the game hackers or not
Agree 100 with everything I just think that Starcraft has the potential to be a bit bigger than It is right now if We can get e beter atmosphere around it
I think part of it was blizzards attitude that anything they touch is golden and perfect
yea hearthstone isn t team based but the only reason it matters that a game is team based or not is because making a game team based lowers stress levels It divides responsibility for losses Hearthstone might not be team based but it does have large ways of cutting down on stress discomfort anxiety fear anger etc by having no chat between players other than emotes and the balance in the game is so bad that everyone can blame their losses on something other than their own ability like cards decks hero matchups luck etc
I think your analysis that a game should be played first is valid However I don t think LotV is specifically more fun for casual players The new units and changes added through HotS and LotV have only sped up the game and introduced units that require even more micromanagement adepts ravagers reapers etc
Pretty accurate
Other games being team based is not hotbids only argument He also said other games or more easy to get into and appeal more to casual gamers Hearthstone clearly falls into the second category Even just watching HS is much more relaxing than a twitching seizure inducing sc2 stream where someone new has nearly no way to know whats going on Hearthstone on the other hand is very easy to follow and I think the popularity of Hearthstone streamers afaik they consistently have the most watched solo streamers goes a great way into Hearthstones success as a competitive game
What would Kripp have to do with Hearthstone s popularity

Is this a what day is this
I remember hating all of the positivists back in 2012 2013 Today I am a bit more on their side Not in that everything is great but rather in that is it really the end of the world if the game isn t as big anymore way I can still play on the ladder and face good competition and I can still watch a good amount of pro games to get my satisfaction fulfilled there
delusional positive still exists with the new WCS changes Apollo and others saying the current WCS system is the best system there has ever been
That s not delusional Its definitely a risk though I d like to see how it goes this year now with half the wcs playoff spots guaranteed to come from outside korea Maybe it ends up looking like a joke or maybe the foreign scene gets a huge boost
SC2 is a difficult game to play It is also oddly self destructive The 3 races probably has something to do with it as you always have one third of the population fighting the other two thirds
Good article sc2 might not be as big as some people hoped but it s still got a very active ladder and more pro matches then I have free time to watch We have a fantastic game and we should enjoy it
There was a lot of speculative investment in the game when it first came out teams were created on the expectation that the game would reach a certain size when it failed to meet those expectations the scene naturally shrunk This isn t a failer of the game but rather just a natural reaction to overly optimistic initial investment The retirements of players and the closing of team houses isn t the beginning of the end it s just the scene adjusting to a sustainable size
But wheat I really want to know is what impact does it have for people who use ded gaem ironically A lot of the time it s impossible to distinguish
This video illustrates the situation pretty well https www youtube com watch v retK1rz zcM It s like it was made for us p The Boss BroodWar Big Boss SC2 Snake Us the community
The ded geam spam was definitely the most damaging thing that ever happened to sc2 who wants to play a game that is stressful as hell dead and looked down upon I honestly hate everyone that ever contributed to it with a passion I can t understand why you would do something like this
ded gaem is a meme its kinda the point people say it for no reason other than to say it they wouldnt be here saying anything if there went fans
I blame the fact that we were banned from shitposting memes and jokes on the sub as part of the whole thing made the sub a split between serious threads and celebrity related threads neither of which are easy to get into I also blame the arrogance of the community and the refusal to learn from others when ti comes to business models and whatnot Also f ck Slasher is this still a thing
With yesterday Unfiltered yes
Good read but I partially disagree with its severity I don t think either attitude has damaged the game too much There are other multiplayer games like hon with hugely negative opinions floating around Those games have negative reviews negative toxic communities and negative views of their developers Far more so than starcraft and blizzard Yet those games are popular because 1 they are more accessible to casual players and 2 everything you need to know learn is inside the game Sc2 on the other hand is very hard to pick up In lol you can learn as you play you can read item descriptions in the downtime while loading or dead Sc2 has no downtime You have to read the building and unit descriptions in AI games You have to learn hot keys and unit counters A bronze player will go mass zealot against mass roach and get frustrated when he loses without knowing why he lost Lol has a recommended items guide for each hero Sc2 does not have a build order tutorial for each race You have to go outside sc2 to gg tracker to see how your game went You have to go outside sc2 to find build order writeups and YouTube guides to even get out of Bronze The elitist minority who make it out of Bronze gold on their own go out of their way to scoff at lower league players Still there are many amazing positive things about sc2 Very good match making despite the mmr being hidden and leagues being meaningless A very well balanced and fast paced fun game If we want to make sc2 multiplayer more popular honestly I don t think the community attitude matters that much What matters is if blizz can make sc2 more accessible to new and casual players Not by dumbing down the gameplay mechnics but by putting everything you need to learn and improve inside the game along with positive achievement milestones instead of meaningless leagues Not everyone wants to improve though Lots of us are happy to be bronze silver If blizz wants to hold onto us casuals they need to make meaningful achievements beyond the objective of just winning a game
dead gamers caused some issues blizzards terrible ui caused some issues the community bashing people who only wanted to play team games caused some issues the community hoping their favorite players lose in tournaments so they can justify their balance whines arguments caused some issues the lack of a region lock caused some issues a lot went wrong with this game
Blizzards only mistake was to make the game seem like it had to be played perfectly by focusing heavily on 1v1 multiplayer Sc2 crushed what people thought rts games were like and brought down the reality hammer a little too hard In the old days of AoE2 and BW to some extent people didn t know how bad they were at playing these games I wonder what would have happened if the Arcade was free from day 1 for example
I love hot bid but a lot of this post was about negativity and seemed to focus around that instead of the real issue that was grazed on in post The reason sc2 isnt on the same level as lol or csgo or dota or even hearthstone is because of the reasons those games are typically in that order They have to be easy enough for a casual fan to play All these games minus dota kinda can be played at a basic level with friends very quickly They have to have a european or american scene that is competitive If you dont have this you are eliminating some 70 of your viewer demo from having a regional attachment to the players teams The game concept needs to be simple Day9 spoke very well on this in regards to csgo being a simple point the gun and kill the bad guy and plant the bomb game League dota are also simple in regards to kill the bad guys using abilities and kill the turrets nexus both game do have the struggle with the complexity of teamfights and the messiness that comes with lots of abilities Hearthstone really struggles if the viewers dont know the cards and options available to the player a They need to be a team esport with teams that stick around Gstl was the closest sc2 ever got to this and it still played second fiddle to the individual tourny
by acknowledging that sc2 isn t doing well is he sort of being a ded gaemer he s basically saying yeah it sucks now leave me alone with what little i have
JUst watch and love the game The ded game Bs did hurt the scen a lot
I don t know SC2 is still the only esport I have any entertainment watching the other more popular team based ones are all pretty boring to watch I ve showed my non gamer friends SC2 matches and even they can enjoy watching all the crazy action Show them a pro DOTA match and like myself bored after a few minutes of the monotonous action
The WCS system killing the independent tournament scene the pay model for the game and the toxic terrible community were all bad
Delusional positivity without a doubt it prevented Blizzard from fixing the game soon enough Ded gaemers were warning about this back in 2011 2012 when SC2 was still popular They re only beating a dead horse now so yeah they re assholes now but they were right from the beginning Some of the ded gaemers were SC2 lovers and were just warners and are now pissed their warnings weren t heeded They blame the delusional positivity people for this and out of spite continue to ded gaem them in chat rooms and on forums out of anger for them having contributed to the status quo They are not going to sit there and let them delusional positivity camp enjoy their ded gaem by themselves because this was a game they loved and had hopes for It s a way of constantly reminding them why it s a ded gaem and whose fault that is
We should continue blaming ourselves It was neither the 8 months of Broodlord Infestor which shoved sc2 from the second spot of twitch down to barely in the top10 or less or the many months of blink stalker all in Or over a year of turtle swarmhost that killed the game We should keep blaming ourselves over the people who have complete and total control over this game and always have This habitual denial never seems to fade from reddit
I agree with everything but I still believe SC2 can be premiere a Esport the changes in lotv have raised the skill ceiling and as long as blizzard can keep raising it and give the opportunity for players to raise the bar again and again extremely difficult pro level play I feel like SC2 can have a great niche following that will be appreciated by fans for years to come it wont have the s that other games might have but it will have a level of play that mesmerizes the audience That is what makes BW such a long standing game the high skill ceiling and the wow factor that goes into watching players who can do things and move like no other sorry for the rant but i still believe hopefully blizzard dev team does not let us down
What will be the draw for new players though Nobody will want to pass from amateur to pro when there s no money in it
All of the top games are team based False Hearthone streamers and tournaments are now getting more viewers than SC2 StarCraft 2 is never going to be the world dominating esport that people thought it would be False SC2 was the world dominating esport when it came out but then other products came out with a better esport system came out Instead of being happy and just enjoying a great DreamHack Leipzig tournament they re obsessing over viewer numbers People obsessing over viewer numbers is because that s how tournaments organizers decide whether or not to keep investing on the game It is only natural to care about the numbers if you are invested in the game
But yet HS is still higher in viewership than SC2 and people have been able to make a comfortable living playing that game So I don t think its a team based vs one on one issue here Also LoL came out before SC2
Team based games are inherently more social and less stressful Hearthstone is similar to that its the perfect streaming game Hearthstone may be a successful 1v1 game but ihs point stands its never going to touch CS Dota League which are team based game It s very similiar to how custom maps overtook WC3 s popularity That s the perfect example Dota as a mod outgrew WC3 by a monumental amount part of that has to do with the social mechnical aspects of each game 1v1 is not the be all handicap but its certainly a handicap to popularity
Hearthstone is constantly top 3 Twitch game fighting with CS GO and DotA only LoL is really untouchable in terms of viewership
Hearthstone is constantly top 3 Twitch game fighting with CS GO and DotA only LoL is really untouchable in terms of viewership
Look at concurrent number peaks Dota cs go and league get a million or more for their best tournament Hearthstone gets less than 200k
Thanks HotBid Great written
Isn t it obvious that sc2 is pretty damn hard for new players If they watch it they can t understand shit if they play it they can t understand shit until after a while It s also harder to play Starcraft2 with friends than the other games mentioned if you want to play the serious game mode you have to play 1v1 If you see hearthstone you can read on the cards and see the numbers if you play it you will be put in the lowest rank and you can probably win games Starcraft is not like that it takes a while to actually understand I think these are the big problems that drives people away other games are just easier to pick up and they probably look more fun to most people they are also cheaper and some of them are free to play Who wants to pay 40 for something you can t even understand
in other news broodwar is alive and well
Guys it was simply a gaming trend games lose popularity over time Meanwhile league is older than sc2 If anything all this article proves is that delusional positivity is much worse
He specified why SC2 lost it s popularity and it had nothing to do with the game s age Try harder next time
SC2 lost its popularity because of bad design plain and simple Terrible unfun units and mechanics that often defied a race s core principles have been added and kept in the game and they haven t been changed because it s still balanced And now the races rely on these broken mechanics so we can t get rid of them without changing it all Protoss can t play bully like it used to and had to rely on cowering behind a forcefield until it can death ball with its AoE Face it Protoss is at its core a very very weak race Its strength relies on overpowered crutch units and mechanics duct tapped to its sodding mess of a carcass Don t get me wrong I believe P is the most frustrating race to play against but it s not because the race itself is strong it s because of just a handful of units mechanics that are extremely overtuned and are constantly abused Terran positionnal warfare is dead and gone Tanks have been bad for quite some time now it s just about mongolian drops Instead of being about positionning and tactical surgical strikes now it s just find a gap where I can push all these dropships in their main Of course they tried to add the Liberator to fix this but this is just another exemple of fixing something broken by adding another broken thing As for zerg they don t feel Zergy at all anymore The concept of creep and queens is actually a very cool one they feel very alien thanks to it but they don t feel zergy The Roach is probably the biggest fucking exemple of this Zerg was based on lots of small not so cost efficient units that could be pumped out by the dozen to overwhelm enemies and take advantage of soft vulnerable positions Instead they were given the roach The most cost efficient T2 unit in the game what the christ Compared to Stalkers and Marauders the roach is HANDS DOWN the most cost efficient both in terms of health and damage For a race that relies on its inherently better economy to make up for its weak units giving them such a stupid army buffer is ridiculous RoachHydra Pure Roach Roach Ravager are probably the least zergy compositions out there Now Ling Bling Muta THAT felt zergy as hell Moves fast not the most cost efficient units but they simply use their movement and sheer numbers to overwhelm the opposition But that style is long long gone If they wanted to fix SC2 there was so freaking much to change Instead of focusing on adding more units because more is always better amirite they should have thought about removing units and reworking others The fact that the game is clogged up with units that are never used SH Colossi Thor because they re vastly outclassed by units with similar purpose says something
Zerg completely feels zergy wtf are u talking about It s all about overwhelming with numbers in a swarm which is exactly what it plays like Terran drops are all about position that s what multi pronged aggression is all about drawing your opponent out of gasp position while you take an advantageous position with your main army I agree with protoss I was a protoss player in bw and I can t fucking stand the design of protoss in sc2 which is why I play terran and off race zerg
In theory yes that s what multi prong aggression would be but Medivac Boost makes actual positionning less of an issue They move so fast that you could just throw the medivac through a donut of turrets and you d still get your unit dropped in time In BW you didn t have that boost If you wanted to drop a M M squadron you had to be far more careful with your dropship
There was a small window SC2 could have hit in 2011 by building a real scene with legitimate foreign teams and leagues and they smashed right into the window like a bird The fact that seemingly no one has learned that lesson is the really frustrating part and why it s easy to keep trash talking everyone in charge
The great 2011 SC2 bubble It was pretty glorious wasn t it I remember when the first koreans started coming over to MLG events everyone was so hyped to watch high level play Then more and more started coming over for events and all the foreigners started getting crushed even in early stages Huk winning Dreamhack 2011 was arguably the best moment in all of SC2
The window was in 2010 not in 2011 This is when SC2 had the biggest player count by far
Such a superfan HotBid once was Or was he
only two likes ded game don t shoot me
Who cares gaem is ded Up Broodwars or Down Starcraft2s to the left
I know I m going to be downvoted for this but SC2 leagues needed restrictions Much like NES did in the days to stop spamming games and what Apple does with its iOS I solely think Blizzard took the wrong way They should of hosted their own tournaments or sponsored a single one with huge payouts What resulted was a huge variety of tournaments that players could of participated This may look good in the eyes of viewers as there are plenty of streams casting but it really feels spammy after a while A good control of strict quality content would probably have made the leagues feel bigger and worthwhile to other players In the SC2 life time there is just too many to think and difficult to decide MLG GOM WCS NASL I believe it was too overwhelming and it really divided communities to watch their preferred league

2004 This dates back to Diablo 2
Honestly it seemed awkward for it to be right between GSL matches but once they announced a date they should ve stuck with it Now those eight GSL players who had been preparing for a patch right before their Friday matches have wasted practice time
its kind of a lose lose situation no matter what they decide it would screw someone over at GSL
That has nothing to do with the comment you re replying to He is saying it s stupid to announce one day then SWITCH last minute rendering their prep useless They could have announced either Thursday or Friday but they should have at least stuck with it How did they not realize the conflict with the GSL IEM qualifiers until just now Just plain incompetence
like i said its lose lose sorry we already announced the date you ll have to play the qualifier with the new patch will get negative response from the players as well
You re missing the point entirely
They don t want any Terrans sneaking in quite yet
God this delay feels so fucking unnecessary If jjakji loses to classic because of the adept I m going to be so pissed And I can t even imagine what all the foreign Terran players practicing for IEM must feel because they just got absolutely fucked
I m going to say something controversial I think jjakji is a much much worse player than Classic in any balance
But we haven t seen that much of JJAKJI in lotv and you do know he s also a GSL champ That s always something Now he s back in Korea on a good team maybe he will be a lot better than before it s hard to say which one is the better player right now I think in hots classic was better for sure but maybe it s too early to say now because we haven t really seen them a lot
Classic won a GSL in 2014 a SSL in 2015 and an 2015 IEM beating Rain herO and Parting Jjakji won a GSL in 2011
I know classic is the better player but we have seen lots of players drop of in lotv and new one appear stronger than ever just an example could be innovation so far he hasn t been impressive at all I know classic is better but I think it s fair to say we don t know quite yet how they will be playing in lotv
I don t think that is controversial Atleast not in my mind
It was sarcasm
the jinx
IEM qualifiers happen in two waves there is another wave next week so we will have one before and one after the patch
seriously i feel like the adept change should be more urgent it s like they know how OP it is and bad for gameplay but they don t mind it letting it burn the house a bit more wtf
Calm down there is still another qualifier after this one for iem
Well there are two weeks of qualifiers and a challenger for everyone to still go through So it s not like it s just one shot But for GSL this is huge As if I was a player in that match with the announced date I would have been practicing only the balance map
what if he wins because of the liberator
kinda getting used to getting screwed over by Blizzard as a Terran player lately
IEM qualifiers happen this week and next week furthermore today and tomorrow are just the open bracket of the actual qualifier that will happen on Saturday post patch so it is mostly them not wanting to interrupt gsl
Right choice They have fucked anyone in the qualifiers with a meta shifting patch
Ah well I was looking forward to hitting the ladder this weekend I can wait another few days
You can still hit the ladder it is just going to hit back
gonna hit back hard
The patch will be out on Friday though so Just one day delay
Ahhhh reverse dates format I just read the 1 of 1 29 and thought it meant 1st Feb p
don t worry if it was that long I would cry
I believe you mean freedom dates format
Well Thanks for coming out to play Terrans You can go home now until the next tournament
are terrans getting buffed
Protoss in PvT is getting significantly nerfed TvZ is pretty much fine but its getting a small nerf to Zerg as well No patch change directly affects Terran units
Am I the only one that thought What the hell has the date format to do with balance
Came to bet on how quickly the first negative whiny comment in the bnet thread would show up 5 and was not disappointed 4
When are the new maps being announced
about 3 months next season is same maps as this
sounds good current maps are modern pieces of art
The amount of bitching in this thread about a balance update being pushed back one whole day is ridiculous
And here you get down voted for it too the world is amazing isn t it
you obviously haven t the faintest clue why they pushed it one day and why its significant then
If only they had some kind of schedule to look at ahead of time like the rest for us guess the technology isn t there yet
cool you can quote something and not understand it
As someone who reads the comments on blizzard forum regarding updates many people really just shit on blizzard for everything they do Guys just appreciate that they change and update the game People these days are just never satisfied with anything
Although I agree with you in part the problems being addressed have existed since the beta Blizzard was just hoping that korean pros would figure a way to compensate for the issues with techniques strategies It s kinda hard to ask someone to not be pissed off after not receiving a response for months
The patch is needed to make the game more balanced they re waiting to install the patch AFTER tournament qualifiers Am I missing something here
It s not fair to force players to play hours after a patch goes live The game will also probably be less balanced after the patch
When is that ever not the case There are tournaments competitions literally every day of the week They should just release the patch as soon as humanly possible if the goal is to improve the balance of the game
You re missing that even though the change is needed overall it s not fair to change it just before pros need to play and have no time to practice anything else
That will be the case regardless There are tournaments where money is at stake every day of the week
yes you are missing irrationality
FFFFFFFFFUCK
ResidentSleeper
SO without touching on balance can I take it that screwing the GSL players is preferred over semi screwing the IEM players
If Blizzard is releasing this patch because they believe it will put the game in a better state then why on earth wouldnt they release it asap especially before more events take place Them making the patch acknowledges that they believed something needed fixing You d think they want less games events impacted by things they felt needed to be fixed This is just stupid typical Blizzard these days
because you don t don t wanna make all their practice irrelevant
Or maybe they could have let the patch come out before the qualifiers and gsl idk
NO COME ON
We agree that the game is not fair but we think that making it fair too soon may be harmful for the competition
yikes
I didn t know blizzard and adepts were playing archon mode
those battle net comments
PvP hy zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
I think David kim just hates Terran because he is too dumb to play this race Thank you retard kim
This post is rather ignorant He didn t quit starcraft He said on multiple occasions how long it took to make a daily Now with him working on his own game he doesn t have 5 hours to prep a topic and another 2 to present it
Got into Atlas pre alpha a couple months back uninstalled it after a week Really a terrible game
I was in pre alpha too It s called a pre alpha for a reason It s nowhere near done They got feedback and now modifying it based on that By the time it s released it will be completely different Can t call game trash when it s not even close to a final product
Dev here And thanks for respecting the NDA Valonsc 3 We still have several major systems as placeholders economy and strategy were among them in that first test Placeholders aren t going to be fun they exist to make the other parts of the game playable for early feedback P We have the NDA in place to prevent the public from confusing placeholders with our actual vision Expect a LOT of changes between now and when the NDA lifts and even more between then and beta Sorry you didn t like the current state of the pre alpha o2jam vivian please give it a chance when it s in beta or released
how is it really Whats wrong
I m mostly likely violating the NDA here but it s a lot like League of Legends except you have an economy This economy is time based You have workers but you can t make or kill workers You can take bases that are basically checkpoints so it s a lot like capture the flag but again you can t produce or kill workers You have a flat uncontrollable income rate You don t have many units but there are several heroes that all do different things and have their advantages and disadvantages You can make little units to go along with your hero or just throw at the enemy if you want but these are ultimately useless because your hero is well a hero It s your champion It is your everything and if you lose your everything you respawn There are also towers and enemy units across the map as well as enemy guards you have to defeat to take what I would consider the equivalent to a gold base in StarCraft II These bases are guarded so well you can t take them very early in the game but the payoff is definitely worth it To wrap things up it s basically your average MOBA with some extra gameplay features
sounds like warcraft
you sure you werent playing warcraft x
people were expecting a great RTS game that might stand up to starcraft cause of day9 s name But being a great starcraft player doesnt mean youre now suddenly a great game designer thats probably one of the biggest logical fallacies in gaming So many forums posts start with I m a level gamer so i know what im talking about i know how the game should be
Technically he s still doing the Daily Just not the Starcraft Daily
You do realise that he postet that 4 years ago He has still one year left to restart the show Keepo
Are people seriously upvoting this is this what this community has become Day9 left on good terms
This makes me sad
its from 2012
There is nothing sad going on
It isn t sad for a Starcraft 2 Day 9 fan that he doesn t do Starcraft content anymore How the fuck is that not sad
In our hearts
u zngelday9
interesting reading comments from 4 years ago following a very succesful starcraft year
ah shit now I m sad
The game died when he quit doing his content
can t Blizzard PAY him to make dailies and keep the game alive He would make a bigger impact than one more charity tournament for foreigners with no stage
I don t think money the only issue for him He wants to be doing what he loves doing He loves dailies but right now he wants to make his own game He wants to spread his wings and do other things That is why he is choosing to do what he does And I would never ever want Day9 to be censored by anything because of Blizzard Activision
or he quit because the game died
Or he s buys working on his own game and doesn t have 8 hours a day to prep and present a daily
but he has time for hearthstone for sure
Because Hearthstone doesn t take any prep for him He just hops on and streams Okay maybe some prep in the form of theorycrafting but nothing compared to the amount of work it takes to make a daily He doesn t have to watch replays analyze games take notes plan out a thorough lesson etc
And it would be impossible to stream the Starcraft 2 ladder That would require dayyyysssss of prep
Hearthstone doesn t require prep time find a deck make a deck and play takes like 10 min
You so salty for someone doing something good with their life rather than do a daily show for a game no one cares about
Why are you even here
It s one of life s great mysteries isn t it Why is he here Is he the product of some cosmic coincidence or is there really a god watching everything you know with a plan for us and stuff I don t know man but it keeps me up at night
no i mean why are we here in this canyon

That lilbow comeback always gives me chills Great video
When sOs lost that game I was devastated
Fuck it looked like I was having a seizure on the train
lol im glad i watched this home alone
Not as good as best of 2014 but still very nice video
This is fantastic But is it just me or is the music a tad too loud maybe over the casting Maybe intentional Doesn t really matter I loved it good job guys you always do an amazing job with the highlights D
How are you going to show this super epic video with dramatic music and all of that and then the cardboard We Are the Swarm sign Kappa In all seriousness this was absolutely great
I don t like the music Especially when you want to hear the commentators scream And I found the intro absolutely pointless We saw a bunch of cringy faces and so much acne Surely you could find more pretty shots of them to use
I wanna see dragon in a tornament
That fantasy so0 game was possibly the most ridiculous thing I ve ever seen in my life matched only by the soulkey innovation comeback
So nice
Here s hoping this year will be as good if not better My expectations aren t particularly high but let s hope I m wrong
Awesome stuff Anyone got links to the Lilbow comeback game and the Jaedong base race game Edit and the game where the drones won vs the zealots
Great work
b e a u t i f u l nerdchills all over
Balanced year for Terrans Kappa
I can give you my list of highlights from 2015 if you want I think terran has more plays than any of the other races solely because of Maru and Dream
Best of 2013 2014 2015
yeah i thought so too I mean it was still an amazing video and I enjoyed it alot But it wasn t as good as the previous ones
Great video but the audio is a bit out of sync you can for example hear the Forcefields a few seconds before they are placed Well done though I know how time consuming this can be
That was actually the original broadcast that was out of sync for the lilbow highlight If you go back to the vod on twitch or the youtube vod its also out of sync I tried to fix it a little bit but didnt turn out perfect Its just that highlight that is a little bit out of sync rest is good Example https www youtube com watch v bJ4YQHm1DMI t 4m47s
Ah good that it didn t slip past you at least
D
Those baneling drops were nice
Was Khaelaris losing it this year

Has cheesy enough to put a caster on tilt
during the stardust v jaedong i felt like tod was great but the other caster seemed a bit reserved and forced I like seeing how casters bring out excitement in a game and I think tastosis and apollo really do the best
And its almost all koreans but I guess we prefer local heroes and good interviews Nice video btw
stop the salt
the moment I have a spare second I will watch this don t ask why I m on screddit when I have no time free
Why are you on screddit when you have no time free
He said don t ask
You have a ship named Qwib Qwib
He can t tell me what to do
Huh Didn t watch much SC2 this year but all that was very predictable Not very nailbiting
Troll harder
I didn t mind the whole Artosis bashing thing from RL because honestly Artosis kind of deserved it The whole RL martyr thing gets super old but that s kind of what you expect The part that really fucking annoyed me was all the retarded shit that Thorin was saying about the SC2 pro scene and community when its obvious that he hasn t followed the game in years if he even did then
what was said about artosis
He s two faced af
I love how all the responses to Thorin consist of mindlessly repeating he knows nothing about the scene and ad hominem attacks instead of just responding directly to his actual arguments Great community
I love how every Thorin fangay argument is made under the presumption that Thorin is all knowing and is 100 right about everything he says because they like being just as edgy as he is He literally says completely genuinely that you aren t a fan of Starcraft if you like watching foreigners if there are top level Koreans playing Feeling connected to players teams from your region is a very basic psychological response and he says that the the nationalities of the big high level foreigners Stephano Naniwa had NOTHING to do with their popularity Keep in mind this is an expert from a game where fans of teams show up waving that team s national flag at majors and there is CONSTANT reminder of where teams are from but nope this doesn t matter at all in SC2 apparently If you like watching your local regional pros play you re just a retard who isn t really a fan Guess anyone who is a bigger fan of their local NBA team rather than the Spurs or Warriors just isn t a real basketball fan I just can t even begin to comprehend how willingly ignorant or stubborn you have to be to not be able to understand why Europeans would cheer for Europeans or Americans for Americans
I literally cringe whenever Thooorin decides to open his mouth about anything because in his mind he thinks he is completely 100 right No matter what he is right in his brain pretty cringe worthy to watch
Except he didn t say that he said that if you support region locking you don t care about seeing top play which is true Who is better HuK or s0s Probably isn t the guy who last time he had a top 4 finish was 2014 at Red Bull Battlegrounds where he lost to Polt Now why are you keeping s0s out of NA and EU tournaments He s clearly better than any NA or Eu player so why is he not allowed to play in those tournaments So you can grow the scene Keeping out top level pros so dogshit washed up foreigners who won t win anything without Koreans being out of it or only having low tier ones is going to make people want to watch SC2 Nationality doesn t make people hype about players The most famous pros were really good players Not the guy who happened to be from Denmark or France Not the guy who finished top 4 in a tournament of only westerners The BEST The people who could take on the best and now they can t because people are under the illusion that keeping out even other foreigners is going to grow scenes in a game that isn t popular to begin with
how do you think those korean players became good because theyre naturally more talented no its because they have a fucking national industry KESPA behind them backing them up working constantly to provide the best practice environment possible to the players Now expecting blizzard to establish that kind of industry in the foreign scene would be insane however with the recent regional lock changes we can ensure that foreigners at least is given an incentive to practice and improve These event does create an interest for the foreign scene and given the time it will pay off in more viewers and a wider spectrum of good foreigners Now the hype wont be about if a foreigner can take a series in groupstage and possibly advance to ro 8 now the foreigners can at the very least win their own tournaments Besides if you really enjoy sc2 you should easily be able to find enjoyment and amazing play outside of korea The only thing I dislike about this change is that we will see less of the korean scene however perhaps theres now incentive for the koreans to host more tournaments themselves outside of the wcs circuit
But that s not true i can always watch the top level play in Korea if anything the previous years systems have diluted the talent in Korea not by a lot but by a little Just because hyun isn t able to win every foreign event now doesn t mean that the top level play is suddenly gone from the foreign scene it was never there
Now you can never see Koreans play outside of Korea in a scene that is dying because there isn t enough tournaments They literally are strangling Korean SC2 Where is an upstart Korean supposed to go Nowhere because people would rather cheer for a nationality than someone who is actually good But hey now foreigners will be more motivated to play because they don t have to face the best players in the world anymore
But why would you want to watch koreans playing outside of korea if you want to watch highest level of play Koerans that travel aren t always the best and best matches happen in korea where jet lag doesn t affect players
How are they blizzard strangling Korean sc2 there s like 50k more prize pool for Korea already and that s with no kespa hot6ix cups announced Also what hyun is like basically the only regular foreign tournament attendee from Korea and he s certainly not even in the realm of best players in the world
Because while he did make it with his usual asshole word choice that one tweet he made was objectively correct and whether you like him or not you can not possibly logically refute it If a system where the highest level players are artificially excluded from tournaments is preferred by most players viewers and by people representing the community the only possible logical conclusion you can draw from it is that the local esports scene or its players are more important to SC2 fans than seeing the highest possible play He didn t put it very nicely but that s literally what Thorin said and it s obviously correct so people threw a bitch fit The SC community is particularly good at being stupid like that Really everyone here gets super defensive when you point out something bad about the game or its community Someone here flamed me and tried to convince me that I was a long time Brood War player and just wanted SC2 to be BW HD when I d never played it I was a Warcraft 3 player and played the Brood War campaign the first time with the Mass Recall Starcraft 2 conversion because I made some design suggestions for Starcraft 2 units It seems people would rather just stick to constant balance whining that s easier
Thorin hasn t spoken a single coherent original thought about SC2 or League since he s started unfiltered It s gotten to a point where you don t need to refute what he says
You don t need to refute what he says How convenient
Sounds a lot like you just have nothing of value to say m8 if he was super wrong where are all the amazing coherent opposing arguments They seem few and far between
Timestamp on the vod for the stories
Rlewis is a moron He has an amazing talent at making me side with all the people he opposes when I know nothing on the issue just from the hugely biased way he tells every story like the ENTIRE WORLD is out to get him
Well he is right that a lot of time when Artosis wants to take on a project Sons of SC that eSport University thing it ended up scamming his investors by not following up
There s probably some truth to his story he just exaggerates anything to fit his narrative of him being the saint while everyone attacks him for no reason edit I m referring to the incident R Lewis brought up on unfiltered about Artosis confronting him in a douchey way I m not defending the failed follow ups of Artosis
Everything is known Artosis is not a scammer hes just negligent we all know how he tend to start projects and not finish them
Exactly Think of all the shows that he did a couple episodes of and then stopped That s a ton of money he left on the table
then only address concerns when its brought up multiple times and one of those times finally explodes
The people he talks about are welcome to retort to him
I wonder how you d feel if people were actively trying to get you fired for no real reason
Well nothing holds them back to defend the truth You are probably just unhappy that your Tosis dreams have been crushed
I personally don t give a fuck about Artosis image being smeared
Life gets to go back to ST now Freecs where he gets the space to do nothing for long periods of time before going hard at the end of the year KT get Leenock who has historically proven to be a great team league player Still surprising as shit
It s a joke because he seems to go full gosu after hiding for months I think at one point people were considering him the first bonjwa of SC2
first bonjwa lol no MVP was considered before this kid
Nestea and Mvp are both the first 2 dominant players in SC2
True but although they were dominant I don t think SC2 has seen a true Bonjwa yet if we re judging the same way we judged BW
If we are judging the same way we are judging BW most of the BW pros other than FlaSh wouldn t qualify as Bonjwa JaeDong trumps most of the Bonjwas in a lot of the metrics but they didn t call him bonjwa because he misses like 1 or 2 which some of the real bonjwas also miss It got pretty stupid heck there were people even arguing FlaSh isn t a bonjwa and just God because for some weird reason people just couldn t accept that anyone other than the first 4 could possibly be considered bonjwa Mvps dominance was astounding he basically invented mech in SC2 lateron and earlier on figured out a lot of the bio play people still play by his rulebook And even after his first domination streak he had this NaDa like ability to always come back and play great again his ability to preprare and plan for series is uncanny and in SC2 and probably even BW unmatched to this day If Mvp doesn t qualify for Bonjwa oov NaDa and especially Boxer don t either
They called him god instead of bonjwa because no one wanted any association with savior Afaik there s only one qualification for being bonjwa when the Korean fans call you one you are one
what is the definition of bonjwa according to you guys i dont follow these comments
Well sc2 is more international Id say winning a GSL ESL and MLG would be a big feat and bonjwa is impossible in sc2
It s a stupid term with no clear definition
What life has done is much more impressive than what either MVP and Nestea did considering the level of opponents
One could argue that what MVP and Nestea did was more impressive considering how much lower the standard of gameplay was back then Without MVP and Nestea and even guys like MarineKing the the level of opponents would not have reached the current level it is today Of course I m partial to guys like MC who managed to stay relevant throughout the course of the series
But theres a reason people put Micheal jordan above Wilt Chamberlain even though Wilt was extremely impressive for his time
That s a very good point In this instance though I d say it s more like comparing LeBron James to Wilt Chamberlain I don t think there has been a Michael Jordan of Starcraft 2 If we include all of Starcraft I d say Boxer might be a Wilt Chamberlain Flash might be a Jordan MVP might be a Kobe and Life is like a Stephen Curry
Life is definitely not Steph Curry Steph has only been good for like 2 years
Perhaps a LeBron James I suppose Stephen Curry would be the player who wins for the next GSL But you can kinda see where I was going with it
Dropping the bonjwa part Life was awesome because he completely revamped how zerglings were seen in SC2 His first GSL season was based almost entirely on his zergling play previously they had been an early game only unit or used purely as fodder to take enemy shots once terrans had learned to split vs banelings zerglings weren t really used past early game THEN he showed that he could learn to run the rest of the units too I don t need to compare him with other players and argue who is better to find his play awesome and be glad he still plays awesomely
and this kid killed him
Lol MVP is nothing compared to Life Mvp was strong in a time where Terran was the strongest race Life has continually shown to be the best even when Zerg was the weakest race There have been many Terrans that have shown the skills Mvp has maybe even better but there has never been a zerg that has been at Life s level I think everyone agrees that once Life got to face sOs in Blizzcon he was already considered the best SC2 player of all time
Why Mvp has been the best SC2 player of all time by Stuchiu
One of my favorite articles along with the Savior one The greatness behind Mvp is really all in the storyline How he lost his mechanical skill but still managed to persevere And his game sense is unparalleled to this day I loved watching his games where Protoss would hide a dark shrine but he still had blind missile turrets waiting for them Or just about any game vs MKP
There was some controversy surrounding is ESPN article but Stuchiu is a great writer He really showed what has been unique about this player Players like Innovation or now Life have probably been pro longer and won more But there s this whole storyline behind Mvp that makes him such a legend To this day Mvp is the only player who has showed the most genius is his career By far my favorite pro
Mvp still has 4 GSL wins and brought Life to the final game of his potential 5th in the finals And his dominance is not about how many he has but how he achieved them all His first 3 GSLs were in the era of GomTvT and the Big 3 and he still came out on top through his superior mechanics and game sense And then he developed severe carpal tunnel and was considered down and out To which he responded by playing with his ridiculous game knowledge and preparation skill He cheesed out so many players considered to be far above him in his 4th GSL run and his preparation and execution of the 7 game series against Squirtle in the finals was one of the greatest mindgames in Starcraft And then in the era of Broodlord Infestor he still manages to bring Life who was very much at the top back then to the final game
Gomtvt is an advantage to mvp Something like 60 of his finals were tvt he rode the Terran op train pretty hard Inno is the best Terran ever in sc2 imo
I d also put Innovation and Maru both above MVP Especially in terms of raw mechanics
you are right i guess im just too old
Zerg has never been the weakest race
okay tell me exactly when Zerg was the weakest all the races have in all honesty been pretty balanced aside from WoL and the start of Hots I can t remember anytime when Zerg was the weakest race I can t say any of the others have been the weakest either I m not biased I m just thinking about it rationally
As a random player I gotta say you re a really weird person complaining about how other people are biased while you have the most biased opinion of them all
My opinion is biased because I don t think Zerg has been the weakest race Okay
Zerg was the weakest from WoL release in summer 2010 until right before HOTS release and Terran was without a question the strongest in that entire period This is acknowledged fact by most people who were there Typical GSL aka GomTvT rounds in WOL http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 2010 TG Sambo Intel StarCraft II Open Season 1 http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 2011 LG Cinema 3D Global StarCraft II League May http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 2 Click in on every one and see the amount of Zergs starting low and dwindling towards the end of the tournament while Terran amount stays stable or increases The only thing that provided Zergs a chance for the medals back then was the fact that Terran was so ridiculously overpowered that most people were training for TvT while Zergs mainly had to practice ZvT The most underpowered race in SC2 history was Zerg at the beginning of WoL This is not up for debate
BL Infestor era was before Hots release and is probably the time in Starcraft history when the Zerg race has been the most retarded Sure there s a reason we call it GomTvT and terrans were overpowered for the first year of sc2 But it has been pretty balanced since the queen range overlord speed buffs
Zerg won 2 3 of the tournaments you linked Sure there was not as many zergs as T and P but you do realise that they can t be that weak if they win the tournament do you mean Zerg players are some gods that win even if their race is the weakest But thanks for supporting my argument I will keep those links for later incase someone says Zerg is the weakest
Keep whining about your race kid
What are you talking about This thread isn t about the current state of Zerg at all
No but if he can t whine about Zerg how can he be cool on reddit last month
You do realise he was the person that said Zerg was the weakest race
Wings of Liberty HotS post Swarmhost nerf Only time they were ever the strongest was Broodlord Infestor Edit even before the swarmhost nerf in 2014 the top 10 players on Aligulac were all Terran or Protoss The only Zerg was Life at number 1
This is the most biased shit I have ever heard do you even look at what you re saying
http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 GOMTV Global StarCraft II League Medals won per Race Zerg looks so weak God Zerg has been the weakest race since broodlord infestor
And according to that Terran has been dominant for years which clearly isn t the case You re calling me biased yet you follow only GSL statistics that show Protoss achieving less while everyone knows they have been the strongest race in total for SC2 Edit Protoss not Protons
So Terran isn t dominant because of the number of tournaments won but somehow Protoss is the strongest in spite of it What the fuck dude Yeah Protoss can be annoying and has had periods of strong all ins but calling them the overall strongest race in SC2 despite tons of evidence to the contrary just makes you look irrationally biased
but it does show Zerg is pretty damn consistent no You re so biased it s unbelievable
the whole team
Back to Startale flair boys
Startale for life literally
I guess you could say it s the circle of Life
https www youtube com watch v GibiNy4d4gc
Someone really needs to edit that video and throw Life s head on Simba
Take this upvote and get out of here
Wait a minute didn t we just see the KT proleague video and Life is in his jacket taking photos This must of been spur of the moment
or those were filmed a while back
I don t think they were filmed last season KT s had Jjakji in them and no Flash so it was at least filmed in the last 2 months or so
I didn t say they were filmed last season
I know just trying to narrow down the time frame from from your broad statement a while ago
Haha that was my exact though Hopefully Feecs have slick jackets like KT
Those are the jackets of the Afreeca Freecs League of Legends team They look kinda weird imo
STARTALE IS BACK GUYS Also I guess Afreeca Freecs is confirmed for Proleague FUCK YEA
Need Parting now and Squirtle to come out of retirement THE DREAM
And Flash
Squirtle was actually good at SC2 though
and MC
MC was never on ST though
hey let the man masturbate I mean dream I swear I meant dream
Congrats to Leenock and hope Life enjoys his time on Afreeca
Damn that s one hell of a move Will be great to see Life back on his old team
Translation They will lose to skt either way so they don t care
or life was attracted as super star player he has a high salary we can get 3 players for his wage this will benefit the team more
I don t think you understand how teamleagues work
i dont think you understand how innovation works
considering it was basically sOs who knocked KT out of PL playoffs last season
Mercy kill
Isn t it about time we get a Liquipedia page for Afreeca Freecs
Anyone can edit liquipedia
mans got a point
Mmmmmhmmmm dat s a good point
That s a fine point he got there if i may say so myself
He definitely got a point
A good point has been made
Mmmmmhmmm
http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Afreeca Freecs
Wasn t there when I initially commented
exept there is one http wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 Afreeca Freecs
Wasn t there when I commented
wtf woah
Im really not sure how to feel about this
oh wow cool Leenock s been beast as of lately on KR ladder especially in zvz
As a KT fan I feel very confused Leenock is a wonderful pick up but Life is one of my favorite players in all of SC2 s history
I m shocked as well I woulda thought Life is worth a lot more perhaps Afreeca payed KT for the trade not sure how it works really regardless KT didn t get much out of Life in teamleagues and Leenock is in top shape
is Life a good personality fit for the KT I heard something bad about him before
what did you hear
Just base on how the team treated him IE GSL finals vs Parting Life sat there all alone while Parting had many friends coming up When life did win his entire team just looked bored
didn t notice that s cool a lot of the time it s a mindset thing for going into the booth some koreans like people going in some don t but team looking bored after he won yeah maybe there s soemthing to it if that s the case
hmm I see I don t really know because every time I ve seen Life with his team he just seems soo distant Hopefully whatever happens Life would do well and win another GSL to tie Mvp
Well he did seem to joke a lot in when he win matches a lot in proleague when he walked out to his team there was always smiles and what I assume was jokes or compliments But then Life has always been a very confident who can blame him I guess borderline cocky player so I could see how he could get on someones nerves if they don t like that kinda person
True but it is kinda a proleague thing that you celebrate each win like how they high five everyone after they won Plus it is a teamleague so it is actually good for the other players when he wins Where in a individual league the rest of the team doesn t benefit as much
i read some subreddit s comment saying how he switch players in groups to punish Myunsik cuz he heard something bad about him
That s the silver lining for me as Proleague has been my favorite tournament I would think Life is worth more too I m super excited about Leenock though We ve needed a strong zerg on the team for a while since before Life signed to KT I mean and he s definitely one of my top picks if you had to choose
My guess KeSPA is trying to fix the lopsidedly powerful teams to make the seasons more interesting Last year watching Samsung MVP and Prime get stomped over and over was not great I wouldn t be surprised if there was some underhanded shit that KeSPA was pulling to make these trades
I m very glad Life is going back to Startale his play was a hell of a lot more exciting in ST than in KT Rolster
FUCK I m scared for JD now Please tell me its going to be okay
No chance poor JD
Hopefully Jaedong is gonna be able to win in gsl with a jvz but hearing about how good his zvz is from you scares me as a JD fanboy xD
deleted
EDIT This was a response to a passive aggressive comment towards me by u Voltz sc2 who then proceeded to go try to annoy me on twitter after deleting his comment here guessing because he s not a fan of negative karma I ve only played Leenock a couple times this season and I got crushed both times it s not hard don t have to be good to click a name on GM from the one guy who doesn t barcode and check winrates his ZvZ is 71 Now tell me am I not suppossed to comment or offer insight on reddit because any NA GM zerg as yourself who I am sure thinks he s better than me at the game will feel entitled to make passive aggressive comments on the matter Listen bud I don t have beef with you I get it life isn t fair you re good at this game and you get no love so you re disgruntled towards personalities like myself cause you likely don t believe we earned or deserve our place in the community something along those lines right Well here s a piece of advice I gave to Kane and Petraeus in their time a shitty attitude will get you nowhere regardless of how good you are specially if you re not that good which is the case with you You don t have to like me bud that s ok but if there s any truth to what I m saying look past who s writing it and make a change Or maybe don t maybe continue to be yourself works for avilo
lmao this response
You delete your original comment but keep this one Lmao
I give you a C for trying
theres being an embarrassment who knows his time has run out and then theres catz at a new level of low
please be more specific because my team business is doing great and I am not trying to be competitive in LOTV atm just streaming with commentary So I m just not sure what your comment would even apply to
How do you not get tired of it and just subconsciously ignore comments like this is beyond me D
haha yeah idk i m planning a tournament doing invites atm so mostly coordinating on skype and checking reddit the internets while waiting on people to respond I ve actually gotten a lot better at ignoring idiots as of late D
he will respond to anything as long as he gets the attention he wants
Yo CatZ I know this is a weird place to ask this but are you guys looking to get any more Smash players Because if so MikeHaze is looking for a sponsor and he s a top 40 player Also a huge homie who streams all the time
love Smash unfortunately we have no plans to expand or commit more budget there until we re able to grow more
That s too bad I love Chu tho so hopefully he does well for you guys
This is quite unexpected Is this a way to balance the teams
They probably poached Life Dude has got to be the highest paid SC2 pro right now
and at such a young age too
add on top of that the second highest winnings earner of all time in SC2 1st is still MC Life just needs to get like 2nd in a GSL S twice more to beat MC and considering MC is retired the gap isn t going to widen much Add in 3rd is SoS and he would need to win like another 100k championship to overtake life and considering Dear just knocked him out before he could get to code S that sets him back a bit
At a whole 300 dollars a month
Well Life wasn t exactly a positive for KT in proleague last year
Good old Startale Life kinda
Whatever Startale Life is best life

Best SC2 player ever
Hey guys if I rejoin you I need you to promise we won t get stuck in traffic and miss the seasons playoffs again

Nice when do we get the freecs flair
The prodigal son returns Startale forever

Wow wouldn t have agreed to that as KT Leenock is good but Life has proven that he s the better of the zerg prodigies
Gotsta redo that kt rolster hype video though lol
Good with diversity

Unlucky
Not sure who this is better for but this is gonna be interesting to watch

Well that s awful
This is quite the surprise All we need is Big Boy for the OG StarTale trio

We re slowly becoming r JonTron
Imagine if they had a calender with details of upcoming events Only a small fraction of players know about the teamliquid calendar
Yup After a 3 year break from sc2 I forgot about the TL calendar Thanks for reminding me
Would love to see this implemented There are so many events I m unaware of until I see after event discussion threads in this sub
This Whenever you log into lol or cs go or anything there is info about the competitive scene Lots of updates streams events That is what pushes people to buy into the game and to play more It makes the game feel alive And if we feel it s alive then it is alive It s a shame all the events there are that are shadowed by the lack of visibility
One more person just learned about Team Liquid s calendar Thanks It s really tough to stay up to date with SC2 esports if you use the official channels you ve got to make some effort to stay updated
this i go to TL almost exclusively for this if only this was in the client as well I would be set
They do depending if you re in a group or not But I get what you re saying A calendar on the front page available to everyone with events would certainly help
maybe on bnet launcher I dont want a game menu to become a fucking webpage
I try to follow tournaments and I still keep missing everything I ll see a post on here posted 8 hours ago Really odd there s no calendar in game
I would be so lost without TL
Thank you I love the sc2 e sport scene and even I have trouble figuring out what is when etc etc Let me load up sc2 and blam a nice calendar that is always up to date on the latest big sc2 tournaments Sigh so easy yet why Why is this stuff not happening Foster the scene
Do they still have VoDs on the site I just checked and couldn t find where they had them
You can find vods on sc2casts Com
Dota 2 has or had one and nobody used it So I m not sure if it d be used whatsoever Embedding the stream on B Net is the best choice since they ve already done it last year
what is that is there any way to add that to my Google cal
I d probably start watching every event Especially if it displayed it in the date time of my country
if it werent for sc2links Id probably be watching close to nothing There is no other location that has information about what events are going on and where to see them You can t even find that information if you go to the youtube channel of most of these events The reason they dont is money they dont want to promote events without being paid and if they chose to do it anyway theyd go under scrutiny for including certain things but not others
It s so weird that this issue hasn t been fixed TL calendar is nice but it could be so much better A big phone tablet friendly interactive calendar that s easy to read and maybe even has some event details to hype it up would be great
Splyce gg is a great website for finding out about events
it d be pretty sick I mean they could even have special in game chat rooms for the games Imagine all the fun of general chat even more balance whining Sign me up for beta plz
Twitch chat is everywhere
Just need twitch emote integration ingame chat so you can shit post at same time
This has been asked to be done 4 years ago Blizzard never hinted the intention of doing that so it s pretty much hopeless at this point
True Activision Blizzard purchased Major League Gaming recently however who have their own streaming platform System resources in game aside I wonder if this changes anything in regard to a stream on the SC2 homepage Part of all the updates in the pipe or something Or perhaps this MLG integration into the SC2 page of the Battle Net client
I was a part of the IPL acquisition We could have done this then too the game teams said it couldn t happen MLG was acquired by Activision not blizzard Blizzard activision is just the full company name
Upvoted for further clarification Thank you
What ever came from the IPL acquisition I seem to be recall some announcement of regular video content but that never happened
The group did make regular video content But it didnt last long and I think the group was eventually let go folded into other groups
We did for a while then internal groups that were supposed to have been making this content anyway basically undercut us from their position in Irvine while we were in SF They wanted to cherry pick a couple of people away from the SF team and keep the status quo intact in Irvine It didn t help that some of the senior people were disliked by Irvine executive members Basically they decided Ipl was just more heads to do the same things they were doing before and laid off a lot of folks The esports team did a good job retaining and growing the talented folks there but the cinematic and video production team made a bunch of bad choices and let almost all the video producers go I feel because they were threatened by how much our community loved us Community and team 1 retained some of the better ones too Basically you aren t going to get good video content out of blizzard because their video team isn t geared for fast paced content production and you will only get what is provided from outside the castle ESL does a good job now I ve watched people in blizzard cancel bury good releasable work because it is politically advantageous to do so You won t see anyone taking any risks any time soon until that mentality changes
That s sad I loved the IPL group s work I m just an ignorant outsider but I m increasing getting the feeling that Blizzard is stuck in this 1990 s business model content production way of doing things Thanks for the contribution
Deck slots
Have they ever talked about that I stopped playing HS right after Naxx came out so I don t know how it is right now
Nope still on their radar
I would certainly be watching more tournement and event if this happened Half of time I don t even know when stream is going on even if I m aware that tournement was going onm if there was built in client to notify me and also make me watch games at a glance I would certainly be watching it not to mention a lot of people with no exposure to pro scene
When csgo did this their tournament had 300k concurrent viewers The most recent csgo tournament had 100k concurrent where they didn t do this Please just try adding a stream on the main page that will play on mobile quality so that those 49 THOUSAND people not in game just on EU will be boosting the viewers for our tournaments the same way that valve has done
Whoa does this feature count as views that s a big deal
If I m not mistaken Valve has actually embedded a web browser into the CS GO homepage which pretty much loads their blog where the stream is embedded That s why it counts as views
Valve also uses plain HTML CSS for most of their menus including all source games and steam itself which obviously makes it trivial to do things like embed video I m sure blizzard can come up with a way to do the same but it may not be as easy for them
I ve discussed this before with a few people in this sub The problem is that the SC2 client is very clunky Sure they could embed the stream into it but a lot of things would have to be hard coded making it error prone and difficult to do it again unless they redesigned the UI components from almost scratch and make them behave like a web page With that in mind recently they embedded a stream but into B Net instead of the game
of course The stream data is transfered from twitch to your home
yeh but thats not really watching the stream thats possibly just loading it up by accident and not even knowing its streaming in another tab
Yes but it counts as a view It s the same as with advertising just loading a page counts as an impression even if the user didn t scroll down to look at it It s an easy way for publishers like Twitch and their streamers to monetize This would actually help out the SC2 scene a lot because they could possibly get a LOT of views without botting and it would probably raise SC2 up towards the top of the Twitch list during major events attracting more organic viewers
or maybe theres just not that many viewers in competitive gaming that means csgo audience is much much smaller than what people think it is
There isn t nearly enough to do major media deals Most people would look at eSports viewership numbers and be like Okay I can burn through this in like 3 hours That doesn t mean you shouldn t do what it takes to improve your product
what a way to lower yourself to just someone who jukes ad money Theres much easier and less time consuming ways to do that It s supposed to be about the game not the advertisers
Okay so where does the money to fund all this come from How do you think the anything works How do you think soccer sustains itself in Europe Or the NFL MLB NBA In the end advertising money funds all of this These TV deals are what provide the massive amounts of money to fund everything and make it POSSIBLE for owners to be profitable Media money is important It s not just about the game If that s how people running things looked at it this scene would have died in 2010 In the end the benefit to Blizzard of embedding the streams into the launchers make it an OBVIOUS priority due to the trickle down effects and how it impacts the scene surrounding their game And I didn t lower myself to just someone who jukes ad money I m actually in advertising with a lot of history in the gaming industry and have a lot of insight into what actually goes on here
even if there was zero money starcraft would still exist Atleast I would like to think that I cant be the only one who plays because I think the game is fun rather than that it is a great career opportunity The reason starcraft still goes on is because no other RTS has replaced it yet The majority of people involved in starcraft make no money at all those that do earn less than a cashier at mcdonalds If your interest in starcraft is to monetize on its community then yeh the events are important for everyone else its just kind of cool to see well produced VODs instead of the typical VODs made by some guy in his basement
It s also important to note that a lot of CS GO players simply had the stream in the background as watching it in game resulted in item drops
Do you have any proof to backup your stats on CSGO Judging from your post history you look like you re on a witch hunt to shit on CSGO
Agreed OP please PM your credit report and FICO scores k thx
As a former blizzard employee from the IPL purchase we made these suggestions from the start They took our best ideas laid off all the functional staff kept some token members and let ESL do the rest I ll be happily shocked if this makes it to the game client
The technology isn t there
Actually the money isn t there Valve is so rich that they made a almost completely new engine
Oh your from blizzard then
Many of my friends would watch or be interested to do so if there was an integrated stream
I don t think I could even run a stream within sc2 without lag Sc2 takes up enough resources as is I d rather watch on twitch or afreecatv
It could be an option to display the stream enabled by default There could be a dismiss button right on the overlay as well that would hide the stream until the next event
Get out of here with your positive ideas and solutions Can t you see this idea is a non starter like most other ideas We have to maintain a certain level of can t do attitude here in r sc
r starcraft FTFY
That s not the point It s about awareness Most people open the game without checking twitch for tournaments If you have something in game lobby might encourage tons of people to watch streams which increases popularity and therefore more sponsors
They already do that A button is usually also included to link to the twitch stream
Yeah but it s annoying for many people when it minimizes the game I mean don t get me wrong I always watch all csgo streams off game because I personally like to watch it on the browser but I do know many people prefer to watch it in game and csgo statistics proves that
I m one of those people I cbb opening up a link to watch the event but if it were already playing I d probably hang around to watch
I know in the begninig when LOL was becoming huge the only reason why they beat us at times was because of this It s time that we do the same thing to them
Yeah it s not that hard to at least add a link in the game I can kinda get not having video capabilities but come on
They do When a major event happens there is a link right where that Learn More link is in the screen shot
That s not a stream link it s info about the event
They do You can press watch and it will go to twitch channel Source My Polish stream was in Polish game client for Dreamhack
Actually it s a link to the stream
Twitch already uses standard video streaming protocols no need for flashplayer or HTML5 integration it really is pretty simple stuff to fix to be honest
What protocols do they use Html5 is pretty standard also html5 is a suite of standards everyone should follow
Twitch streams can be viewed in VLC for instance with Livestreamer that grabs the RTMP stream which is dumped and played back in your media player of choice fairly simple stuff honestly Edit This is super sick with the GUI someone else made https github com bastimeyer livestreamer twitch gui
Twitch hasn t used RTMP for a long time now it s all HLS
oh ok yeah I m familiarish with RTMP legit Thanks for the links
No problem
Just want to add that views via livestreamer do not count Edit in the twitch viewer count at least they didn t the last time I checked so make sure to open the stream you watch in mobile quality in your browser too if you can to show your support for the stream
HTML5 is used for the video overlay interface but the video itself is still Flash I don t think SC2 has Flash capabilities
Twitch video is just h264 delivered over HLS There s nothing there that requires flash for playback
SCII s entire UI is based on Flash
No wonder it s shit Kappa Really though I had no idea
I assume it s using Scaleform https en wikipedia org wiki Scaleform Corporation
I gathered that from the comments Considering I code for a living this is a shocker for me
That was 5 years ago It s all HTML and Qt now Well at least the launcher is
I don t have flash installed and can see twitch streams so i dont think it uses that
What browser are you using IE is the only major browser you need to download Flash for
I use chrome
That s why Chrome comes with Flash
This guy seems to know what s going on https www reddit com r starcraft comments 42tbrv blizzard please embed the stream on the main page czd0aqk context 3
Something something technology is not there yet
If only you s put as much effort into your memes as your videos If only
I know right if videos only took me 8 seconds to do I d be able to make so many of them per day
That means just idling people counted as 1 viewer csgo is doing this
I believe so I also think that is why their last tournament had 3x the viewers
Fantastic idea
Looks like they re finally implementing some of those StarCraft Ghost ideas
I really wish they would put streams on the front page Would really help push for more viewership and interaction with twitch But im pretty sure the community has asked for this like 100 times and everytime we get no feedback on this It s a shame really because its something so simple and yet so effective
Cant do this cause technology hm LOOK A THIS COMMUNITY FEEDBACK WITH MY DREAM IN IT
The technology just isn t there
They could easily make this watchable in game I reckon WoW has a browser built in for their ticket crap they could just replicate this tech to show streams They could take it a step further and make you be able to link your twitch bnet account so you can use chat in game or just make it so you can chat with other people watching it through the sc2 game
I did something similar a few years ago This was in the launcher not StarCraft II but then again I also made something like this work inside the game I might have to try again since the update
No Blizzard
dude we have been asking about this for 4 years
It really is a missed opportunity isn t it They spend a good chunk of money promoting the pro scene and then they don t embed pro games in the launcher or in the game itself
It s not terribly useful outside of free quasi viewbots Whoever is really interested in the stream will not mind single extra click to get their browser open changed background already brings enough attention Advantage of not integrating stream is very obvious no need to add the decoder or embed the browser that can play it
Never underestimate the laziness and not seeing of things end users portray
I agree with you and u jinjin5000 it s part of the fact that there are multiple things vying for a user s attention and one more click minimize new browser window tab is just another obstacle
Advantage of integrating stream is also very obvious extra viewers and therefore extra exposure and sponsors
I would have watched tournement if I knew it was going on at that moment through integrated twitch stream that showed it was going on Clicking at learn more was tedious and didn t offer anything other than opening annoying new window
but maybe im getting more hooked when i see it right in front of me
ITT People showing they don t actually play the game but are quick to criticize blizzard as many of the suggestions being made have already been implemented
Op please stop making requests that end in question marks
The tech just isn t there yet
I think the View Live button and the whole main screen was Dreamhack s logo we had is enough The auto playing twitch thing will use up ram and bandwith for no reason
reason of doubling the viewers isn t enough lol
do the viewers mean anything if they are afk in the menu
Yup CSGO does it so we at least need to look better
They mean getting more sponsors and more exposure on twich and should stop the dumb dead gaem shit if we get above 100k on a non WCS IEM tournament
If you re begging blizzard to implement a feature only to make a game look not dead then you re only driving the point home Who cares about what people say just enjoy the games being played and be happy we aren t in hots still
it will have almost no impact
apart from the 50k people idle ok lol
Implying that people log into the starcraft client that aren t already hard core player viewers Don t get me wrong though I am 100 in favor of this change
OMG why can t I select more than 12 Units This is the stupid
This was a serious question of mine the other day How different would SC2 be with limited control group
Much more difficult due to smart casted AoE spells and the decreased separation radius between units in SC2
This was a thing How did large battles go down then
1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9aboxaboxaboxa And then you click on your individual casters if you try to storm with 12 Templars selected you storm 12 times Edit at least that s how I did it with terran Id box stim marines and attack on the minimap medics would follow cause they wanna touch those buff sexy marines
Seriously i didn t know that
Yup learned that mistake real quick Tbf I killed the shit out of that guardian
If only it would stack for real
Just issue another command right after first strom
Depends if your spellcasters are magic boxed or not
You had to be good with lots of hotkeys and on the fly box selecting groups of units
10 control groups full of units and there you go Btw that s why scbw is the most mechanically demanding game played professionally ever
Can t have 10 groups because you need some for your CC Nexuses Hatches or w e so you can build workers Lots of boxing
used f keys to quick hop to a map space quick hop to production quick hop back to the battle quick hop to expos
That s another way to do it Either have to use f keys and clicking or use number keys Both ways have advantages and disadvantages
Because it was so difficult to control one single large army you tended to split up your army attack in multiple locations at once and constantly keep trading with your enemies Broodwar had a lot of really cool design choices that made the game more exciting And yes the 12 unit cap was a choice There s an interesting blog post I read about some of their decisions in the earlier RTS designs
Artificial difficulty added by mechanics limitations being stupid Auto mine building selection control group size pathing etc Doubt anyone would play the game
Lack of true strategy Bonjwa s like Nestea or MC are overshadowed by robots like Flash or Jaedong Obviously there will also never be a BW Bonjwa because regardless how well he does he cannot compare to the image we have created of our true idols Edit dunno why I used the response box Take me with you I guess D
I played some BW vs a friend last week Holy fucking shit that game is so hard to play now I was a D protoss back on iccup in 2009 or so around a diamond level SC2 player skill wise and going back now it s so hard to play Can t hotkey multiple buildings have to click for production Hotkeys are all over the fucking place you research P sionic storm but you cast Psionic S T orm don t research Argus T alisman by mistake Pathing is even worse than I remembered FUCKING SCARABS HOLY FUCK How to macro 2 base protoss in SC2 5ee click probe bp shift bg shift minerals w z hold shift clickclickclick s hold shift clickclick This gives you 2 probes a pylon a gateway 3 zealots and 2 stalkers Your keyboard hand moves between 5 and shift on a QWERTY keyboard How to macro 2 base protoss in BW 0p9p click probe bp shift minerals click other probe bg shift minerals 6z 7z 8z click d click d Same thing 2 probes a pylon a gateway three zealots and two dragoons Your keyboard hand literally moves across the entire keyboard between 0 and shift because you need nexuses on 0 and 9 and eventually 8 because you build P robes Unless you fucked up your gateway placement then a zealot and a dragoon spawned trapped in between three gateways and your pylon and you need to bring back your reaver shuttle to get them out Because fuck you In SC2 want to warp in 3 buildings Great Grab 1 probe hold shift queue up all buildings shift click minerals BW 3 buildings Grab 3 probes build 3 buildings don t let the probes block buildings that haven t gone down yet because they won t auto move out of the way and you just won t build the building
I think people would hate the race design No warp in no creep no larva inject etc
Going back from creep tumors creep colonies I d cut myself
You had to use up a drone and minerals to make more creep Jeeesh
Yeah but creep only served the function of building on it You didn t move faster on it or anything back then
Ah interesting thanks
There really wasn t any need for more creep though It didn t have an advantage aside from being able to build buildings on No one build colonies to spred creep just to protect an expansion
I would love having creep micro removed It s such a mundane chore to spread creep Rather be microing army
On the other hand it leads to more interesting dynamics where creeps need to be cleared and players like scarlett can differentiate herself not to mention something like this is always unappreciated imo https www youtube com watch v hPDE1PsKSg8
Sure when watching a game it s neat although if it weren t there those players could use the apm to differentiate themselves in other more interesting ways but it sucks when playing
Why the fuck can I not rebind hotkeys Build probe is on P Seriously I have to bind my nexus to fucking 0 Fuck this switching to Terran This isn t so bad I can get around the lack of multiple building select by using camera hotkeys on a production screen Wait Seige mode is o I Why do I need to use this side of the keyboard I can t even align my hand properly without popping fucking keys out My tanks will need to be in control group 8 or 9 Time for zerg So much for the building hotkeys looks like I gotta check each hatchery individually and FUCK 12 units in my control group Zerglings come out at 2 a pop Was this designed to be played by someone with a third fucking arm
Wait is that why Flash sometimes took his hand of his mouse and used it on the keyboard Because he was used to clicking the far side of the keyboard with his mouse hand
Maybe I m not too sure That seems likely though
No The BW pros know how to use the entire keyboard with their left hand So did all RTS pros before SC2
Well I have seen him do it multiple times the question is why
They often use the arrow keys to set the location of their camera location hotkeys with high precision in the beginning of the game

Balance balance balance
Really BW is in a much better place than SC2 balance wise
only unit that was considered a problem were tanks and those were balanced though map design At one point PvZ was 40v60 in win rate then a guy named Bisu came along and rocked the fucking world with his sair dt builds and shook the match up again and pushed it in favor of toss until zerg learned to cope with that build and it evened out mostly
Yes it s balanced through maps as is SC2 And sair dt isn t the only viable protoss opener vs zerg Protosses in general didn t have a good understanding of the matchups and weren t as good Partly because the better players were just picking T or Z
blizzard would have maps like these on the ladder for 5 years and refuse to change the general concept design and insist on balancing around them http wiki teamliquid net starcraft Blaze http wiki teamliquid net starcraft Dark Stone http wiki teamliquid net starcraft Glacial Epoch
That s why ICCUP and proleague had much better maps http wiki teamliquid net starcraft Fighting Spirit Fighting Spirit was the shit
Iccup wouldn t exist if bw releases today that s the point Also fuck fs that map is so overplayed and boring
Seemed like 95 of my games were on FS Python or Destination I don t know if I even remember any other maps But yeah we d have a broken imbalanced game because blizzard sucks shit at making picking maps
My brother and I played a tonne of blue storm othello and colosseum ii It was just that these maps were common when we started watching a lot of brood war We did add on maps like chupeoung ryung how was that spelled and heartbreak ridge when they came out though Oh and we played a lot of destination ii Destination ii was the shit
Oh I have an idle scv And another And another These depots are massive
Why the fuck is this extractor bigger than a hatchery
No skins and not enough deckslots
Where the hell is my automine Terran OP Whose dumb ass came up with the idea to make the queen a flying unit with no inject larva Toss OP I can t select more than 12 units Zerg OP Dragoon pathing is garbage broken game Refund plz blizzard These graphics suck
I m surprised no one mentioned high ground advantage if you were on low ground attacking high ground you had a percentage chance your units would miss Weird things would happen where a single Dragoon would kill several hydras because of rng
no worker automining Meaning when the workers spawn you d have to manually tell each and every one to mine no building control groups Get used to clicking each and every production building to make units only one rally point which is common across both worker and military units for zerg Unit pathing Have fun seeing your units freak out when trying to go up a ramp as a group especially the bigger units Good for defensive lurkers siege tanks and cannons though sticky attacks meaning when a zergling engages it must complete its melee attack before it obeys your frantic move commands to get the freak away and cancel that attack This is also very obvious when a marine fires Try stutter stepping in BW and you ll see
Complaints Everything Always
Most things in this thread have been covered already except for starting with 4 workers

Is it LiquidRet
Aeromi https twitter com DrAeromi
Way back in the day there was a constant joke about Liquid Ret and increasing his twitter followers Casters would be talking and would plug an individual say MC and say Be sure to follow MC on twitter LiquidRet I cannot recall the origin of the joke I expected many more laughs from my post Instead I ve just realized how old I am and how long I ve been following the scene
This is the tweet that the joke is poking fun at I believe it was at HomeStory Cup 5 that everyone started making the joke
Amazing Thanks for the find Wow 2012 seems like forever ago
I think it just started from Ret complaining about casters always talking about their twitter but not the players
that moment when you explain an inside joke and it stops being special
UPTLO D
Hello guys I created the account but right now there is a team tweeting about almost events and it allows us to be able to do a decent coverage of the StarCraft scene Thanks for following and let your friends that the account can be great for them if they like StarCraft
Thanks you ve made my life so much easier as sc2 no twitter guy 3
Thank you for your work as the sc2 no twitter guy
Wow how did I not know about this Super useful
IAMA person that tweets on this account AMA Also in all seriousness this is one of my favorite projects and Aeromi deserves massive praise for getting it all together A lot of us help cover tournaments big and small but the vision was all Aeromi
If you were an SC2 unit which unit would you be What s your favorite SC2 team color
Probably a fully upgraded Ultralisk cause I don t ever want to die Do you mean team colors like in game I play on friendly colors so I m green
This is what you are then http www teamliquid net forum starcraft 2 157292 the happy ultralisk
Wow had no idea Thanks TLO Good feed
What difference does it make though Not tryna be rude but wanna know what you meant by that haha
Just clickbait
You sold me followed 3

DrAeromi Borsti ploguidic3 and all those who tweet on that account have infectious passion for this game and are stalwarts of the scene They are doing unofficially what really should be done by Blizzard and they are doing a damn great job of it
I appreciate the enthusiasm but my twitter feed is already a mess I couldn t handle another 20 tweets a day
Im sorry but i am having trouble seeing the difference I would make by following someones twitter
Aeromi o
Been following for a while now upTLO d
Yeah I love that account
Didn t know about this Useful thank you all guys
Wow this is awesome
Brosti post on that account aswell give that guy a shout aswell
Easiest follow of the week
I didn t know about this before Following now thanks
Aeromi is a beast Keep going
DrAeromi is truly a credit to the scene as a volunteer It s a real shame that he hasn t got the opportunity as an employee besides O Gaming of course
He does good stuff but would be funny if you could get into blizzard by running a twitter
He does a lot more than run a twitter Even if all his work might be twitter based It s easy to see that
When he started all this he was still a minor
Are there any other relatively unknown Twitter accounts that deserve to be followed
liquipedianet 3
Kenzi131 is great for news on korean teams players
This is a very good account but dem spoilers
He said 2015 was the better system and I REALLY disagree Apart from that good work
Hey Guys I am the new PR Manager for mYinsanity Follow me on twitter and stay up to date on all our whereabouts and memes and stuff D https twitter com Mr Davii
shoutz to my main man T L O
Funny to see the i don t know where the game is at now but too bad blizzard killed the game Shows how the daed gaem circlejerk killed sc2 more than blizzard Actually it isn t funny at all
or more like the shitty state the game used to be cemented people s perceptions and it s hard to change that
I m rather new to sc2 can you give me the ELI5 version of why everyone says that blizz killed sc2
balance and design was absolute shit and nothing was done to even consider changing it not even a year ago blizzard took a huge turn and decided to listen to progamers and community members a lot more The communication you see from blizzard today wasnt existing up until summer last year
I cruise around to various esports subreddits from time to time Everytime SC2 comes up it s almost always talked about very very fondly People have tons of respect for the game and understand how hard it is and how committed you have to be to play it Sadly it seems it s usually talked about like your grandpa that you really really loved but has since passed away That part I don t like but people definitely respect it
The main problem is that it is not the powerhouse it once was and when that happens to a game it usually means it s dying or already dead SC2 is still a long way away from dead but you get my point The rampant popularity of mobas hasn t really helped that view either
Dude the only reason every other game community thinks SC2 is dead is because SC2 community has been saying its dead for 5years We re slowly changing that I think but its funny to me that the community hammered the nail into the coffin and now complains about it as if people just suddenly started thinking it
That was pretty heartwarming to read
https youtu be WJTBPdVpdMc t 30s
I can t help but roll my eyes when people who haven t played sc2 in 4 years continue to say sc2 is shit today I have the same reaction when people continue to shit talk Diablo 3 Sure there were some questionable decisions but both games have vastly improved and offer the most polished and best gaming experience that both genres have to offer
moral of the story first impressions last OR Once a reputation is earned it is very hard to change
Which is ironic coming from the Global Offensive community since the game wasn t what it is first time round The community told Valve what they were doing wrong and Valve responded D3 community told Blizz what they were doing wrong and patch after patch got better Apparently some huge patch just dropped and D3 is in the best state ever And of course this is the same with SC2 It is still not there yet but it has come a long way
Pretty much this It isn t 1997 anymore there are A LOT of games out there for people to play If you fuck it up at the outset no amount of hotfixing is going to fix anyone s first impression of your game Not to mention for SC2 the 2nd and 3rd impressions cost additional money
Like SC2 was shit in 2011 Kappa
Yeah guys next time please be more mature about these subjects For our side such things just needs to be ignored instead of shit throwing to other communities and games just because of some idiots
Ignoring and shit throwing are not the only options You can call him out remind him regardless of his opinion compromising his character in a professional setting is unprofessional
Or you take not everything as seriously and insulting It was a lighthearted comment nothing to get rustled about
I ven t And it wasn t a lighthearted comment the guy didn t even show a hint of sarcasm and the dunce on the opposite side dug their grave even more Cringe worthy regardless of your opinions I can t imagine DH production appreciated the comments Could have easily been Tune into the SC2 finals blah blah Mutiny within eSports seems so petty and it s much more of a self flagellation in the practical sense
Which leads to no where No good discussion is ever had on twitter Regardless what does what you said even achieve Nothing
You do understand that these people get paid to work right I ve already mentioned that the DH producers were likely unappreciative Thorin s tenure on network television will end within a few months because of his social networking miss steps It s not 1995 The Internet isn t an anonymous haven of shit throwing any more
Well i responded to the wrong thread thought this was about thorin I agree i don t think they should get a free pass because they were being paid and they have to be proffessionals Regardless the shit throwing i am talking about is not about the analysts but rather about the communities
If the CSGO community isn t happy about it they should make it known to their figure heads not to talk unnecessary shit and make enemies Whoever the hell Sadokist is just wanted to create buzz so more people would know who the hell he even is Didn t like CSGO before and I m not going to be running to check out what I am missing thanks to these fucks Actions have consequences and proclaiming oh it s just a joke when there is no evidence of that is equally retarded
That s fine I ll decide for myself what is silly and what isn t though
They get paid by companies that do not appreciate statements like that And if it was silly someone should probably laugh That s also there job There was no Good Cop for the two Bad Cops just the apathetic host in the middle Bad casting regardless of the opinions and games discussed Jaded as the SC2 community Are you seriously opening that can of worms in your face
I think people are just overreacting It was a little joke
Then it s a very bad joke That was very unprofessional to state that out live on such a big event Plus that s not true at all As someone working in the e sports scene he should know Starcraft and CS GO are both the top e sports games at their respective genre RTS and FPS Both are great games and deserve to be among the best e sports out there There is no point comparing which is best
Not jokes that dis respect something in the field you are working for You don t or rarely see these things in traditional sports But it s just gamers so who cares
Then someone should have probably laughed There s only 3 of them up there The one on the opposite side had the opportunity but was too scared to form his own opinion or a rebuttal as devil s advocate a huge part of a professional caster s job
Well I never said it was a good joke
It was a joke and this csgo response was posted within hours of the joke
Maybe that Starcraft isn t free to play like Heroes or literally always on sale like CS GO Another option would be the lack skins and microtransactions Actually i don t really know what Blizz could have done better to keep the SC2 players I think the main reason why the game is so small compared to CS is that SC2 is more frustrating more stressful to play and that you can t even blame your team I ve got to admit that the most epic moments in games i ve played always turned out to be team games like Battlefield CS GO Starcraft 2v2 Competetive Starcraft is almost exclusive 1v1
Basically that Blizzard didn t transformed sc2 in heroes of the storm
If that was a joke it wasn t funny Kind of cringey actually
Some people suck Don t need to start wars
Careful about linking a subreddit without non participation you can get shadow banned or banned for brigading
Thanks for the good advertisement u NaNiWuT http imgur com pvvbJaN
People on this sub and even that sub made a much bigger deal of a quip than they should have It was just a joke Wasn t particularly funny but whatever More evidence that SC2 remains well respected especially its pro players Always good to see
So because they agree the casters are stupid they need a shoutout Everybody knows StarCraft is the pioneer of esports whether they like the game or not this isn t shoutout worthy No matter what state the game is in we ll always be the reason they exist
Everybody knows StarCraft is the pioneer of esports whether they like the game or not Except of the 75 of the e sports fans E sports grew massively in past 3 years Do you really think that more than 10 of gaming population that came in that period has any idea about how big SC was during 2001 2012

Cheeses are viable strategies just like any other play in the game If it can be done it s viable and shouldn t be raged at or considered a lesser win
deleted
I hate playing against cheese but I absolutely LOVE watching it Game 7 of MVP Vs Squirtle in one of the 2012 GSL Finals The one with the Archon toilet was soooo very good https www youtube com watch v vE59uz9z4Qo So many of my favourite moments have been cause of cheese Flash cheesing Naniwa with a 2 rax TLO 6 raxxing IdrA MC vs Puma in the first NASL finals list goes on and on
It s the very reason esports are both popular and unique There s no referee stopping play to give a stern talking to a player for using his elbow The game goes from start to finish and anything you can do in the game short of hacking and obnoxious exploits is allowed and a valid strategy Besides as a spectator cheese is entertaining As a defender not so much
Talk about unpopular This one takes the cake
If an unpopular opinion makes it to the top of this post does that mean its popular
1st order strategies easier to do than defend are necessary for a healthy meta in any game otherwise you could just be greedy
I agree and the hate comes from the fact any skill level player can do some version of a cheese At lower levels it s often a cop out but its important at top levels to have the threat in a series A lot of people refer to game 7 of Mvp vs Squirtle as their favourite in the series largely due to the fact that it took balls of steel to make such a strategic gamble in the very last game of a GSL final
That reddit doesn t always know what is best for the game
My unpopular opinion is that the game is in great shape and going in the right direction Also that Blizzard is listening to feedback and taking action at a pace that seems reasonable enough for how complex the game is
guess we have an unpopular opinion in common
Lotv is really sooo much more fun than hots I m shocked
I completely agree with this I just wish they would tweak the client or the game itself a little bit more more focus on e sports escene less website interaction
100 agree
BW nostalgia has been seriously detrimental to the development of the sc2 scene as a whole
I agree comparing the two games from the beginning was unhealthy for sc2 imo as well KeSPA switching over to sc2 helped with this but overall I think the sc2 community tends to try to be really Elitist for some reason
Hell the SC2 community is super elitist about it s own fuckin game Ever since League started getting popular SC2 players have always been like SC2 is so much harder to play fuck that skilless community and that s just served to sever the SC2 community from establishing any semblence of a relationship with other communities the way DotA2 League are chummy with the CS GO community
upvote upvote like BW alot and still play it btw
As a counter do you think SC2 would have succeded at the same degree if SC and BW didn t carry the weight they do
Can t make a two without a one
To follow that up I think the most detrimental thing to the SC2 scene and cause of its lost popularity viewer numbers has been the community not the game so many elitist balance whiners and total BM for anything you post on any forum whether it is blizzard TL or reddit oh you re not GM stfu then you know nothing The total focus on viewer numbers and the try harding of being the top pro game by viewer numbers is imo contributing to the opposite
David Kim does a pretty good job of designing balancing SC2 The community gets so emotional and gives the guy waaaaaaay too much hate
Agreed hots at the end was was probably most balanced asymmetrical rts in history
I d say most balanced rts in history Plenty of other RTS games have awful balance within a race
Yeah but if everyone has the same race or just copies the game is somehow balanced
DK is our batman we do it because he can take it He is the hero we need but not the one we want
DK David Kim DK Dark Knight Coincidence i think not
on the other hand I think one of the major problems of SC2 is that units die too fast I said this for years If I was at Blizzard I would tryout what happens if you double the health of every unit I think it would greatly benefit the gameplay Like in BW were you could much more handle multiple fights macro And more room to let real micro and real magic happen That nobody at blizzard seems to get this makes me sad and also D K stand questionable Not understanding the core mechanics maybe
To bring up a counter point I think Blizzard avoids this just so that it isn t too similar to Warcraft My thoughts when someone asked me the differences between Starcraft and Warcraft aside from the obvious character differences is that one RTS is more about controlling a massive bigger army and it s counterpart has a smaller sized army where each and every unit is a bit more valuable with the addition of a hero that fights alongside the army
WarCraft III is like a party based RPG basically with more micro intensive gameplay because every unit count but much simpler macro game
The ded gaem meme is the most damaging thing to happen to sc2 esports It hurt the scene more than anything blizzard had done The amount of hate and vitrol at the height of negativity drove away pretty much all my friends and a lot of other people who were interested in sc2 and when I tried to introduce new people to the game they would ask isn t that game dead
100 agreed which ironically makes this opinion slightly less unpopular People outside of Starcraft who know next to nothing about it have it s dead as their most important impression of the game It sucks
I also see people who left at the height of the negativity spouting the dead game bullshit which is pretty infuriating It feels like whenever SC2 gets mentioned in r dota2 or something some asshole has to talk about how they left sc2 for whatever game and how its dead and yadda yadda yadda
And how blizz killed it but that same guy who said that doesn t prolly even know what legacy of the void is
SC2 was brought down heavily by old boys club not wanting to compromise their positions opportunities by speaking up about issues surrounding the game Many people in early SC2 chose to perpetuate relentless positivity for short term benefits
The argument between destiny vs djwheat incontrol and idra was the epitome of it The most memorable SC2 moment for me and it wasn t a match
https www youtube com watch v G BVpyueqXY looooooooool
edit painuser is my hero edit 2 i really really want to punch wheat in the face right now
damn now I respect destiny more than ever
He said unpopular not blatant truth
Those two things are not mutually exclusive at all
I d guess I m a member of the old boys club by most standards yet I ve always been extremely vocal about any issues surrounding the game and I ve always spoken my mind about polarizing subjects both against and in favor of Blizzard s position at times I guess the point I m trying to make is there isn t so much of a club just different people with different priorities and opinions willing to say different things Personally if I was to say my detailed opinion on the state of the game and what led us to where we are today I d need to write the longest article I ve ever written and that s quite long But the easiest TLDR would be StarCraft isn t bigger because Blizzard hasn t done a good enough job of marketing the game Not to say that it can t be turned around as shown by CSGO
Thanks for the ego boost I have decided on the back of your kindness to self proclaim myself president of the New Boys Club
Awesome Fine you dont have to say anything I ll be your Treasurer of the New Boys Club
Cool taged
Well i dont think you are a member of the Old boys club I think more of the State of the game guys Inside the game guys People we used to see all the time like Incontrol IdrA day 9 Artosis Nony JP djWheat etc Anyway its its suggestive i guess
subjective
I agree with your statements From what I have been exposed to you are objective and it is refreshing Blizzard had have the greatest capacity to influence their creation My opinion is still applicable but I understand how its wording can implicate all members of the club that was not my intention apologies if it was interpreted that way
The sad thing is so many of the old boys club that benefited from the game immediately jumped ship when its popularity started to dwindle a bit Used the game s community as a platform for themselves and not because they loved the game
the topic is unpopular opinions not stuff everyone already knows
Yeah well this is reddit Everyone already knows everything including that which they do not
A lot of people here need to grow up and realize that there is no conspiracy behind every instance of someone not saying exactly what you want to hear
Not a conspiracy such behaviour is extremely common in humans Can t really judge these people without being in a similar position
I agree mostly IdrA s statement on inside the game when Destiny was on it was something that I agree with at the time He said that blizzard can keep being terrible at supporting Starcraft and the community around it can build it how they see just like Broodwar It was a nice sentiment and I thought it was possible No one could really have seen that not only have blizzard done nothing for the scene but they ve actually hindered and downright sabotaged their success edit Grammar
I honestly think that there aren t 2 sets of people in the i m a fanboy and the i hate what blizzard does personality I think all people who come to this subreddit or play sc2 BW are notorious for possessing both of these personalities depending on the scenario
I think really only day9 would be guilty of that The other old boys were pretty critical of a lot of stuff blizzard did Of course they didnt shit on the game at events
cough Artosis cough
You re right but it probably only becomes unpopular once you start naming names Then everyone s How could you say that about X He s done so much for the community What have you ever done Well yeah maybe X has done a lot for the community but that was also in his self interest doesn t make them above criticism or incapable of being deceitful or a self important asshole
This subreddit is full of idiots I don t see other explanation for This random person in a popular subreddit mentioned SC2 in comment section posts going front page with 80 90 upvote ratio
The Basetrade tv casters are horrible Especially Rifkin he has zero game knowledge and has the nerve to talk about balance You can tell that he does not know what is happening in the games he casts at all
and as a foreigner I must say I can t understand when he speaks
I envy you D
They know they aren t the best and nobody will disagree on this point However they work hard to bring us a lot of great games and that is more than enough After all it is about the game and not the casters
i really can t stand broodwar fans the game however is ok i guess but the fans make me so angry
Like vegans being vegan is cool But vegans can piss off even the most patient man sorry vegans but the vocal minority ruin it for the rest of you
Being vegan is fine Vegan food is good and tasty even they got a way to make some stuff taste really good What I hate is the obnoxious in your face vegan that goes OMG YOU SHOULD NOT EAT MEAT IT IS TERRIBLE trying to tell me what to do Fuck that guy It s the same with BW fans imo
That hacking literally doesn t matter and that blizzard was right to optimize the game for less lag but slightly easier to hack If you are a playing a hacker your skill level is to his skill level the advantage the hack give them You still have a 50 50 win rate according to MMR obviously hacking at a tournament is would be a problem and hacking in game is unethical bannable
that is actually a really fucking good point You could argue that it is a problem when someone is hacking in gm which would be a problem but for all us scrubs outside of GM then it doesn t matter as much as we think but it will also be a problem right when he enables his hacks for the first time as he will experience a spike in MMR All of those people beat will feel cheated of a win and rightfully so because they were
The community view that anything difficult equates to a higher skill cieling There are so many potential changes that can ELEVATE the skill cieling while lowering the unrewarding and unexciting APM Some of this has been implemented with the new steal control group settings and the presence of more active abilities in LotV but not enough The wire frame at the bottom leaves much to be desired Quantified totals of each individual unit selected a Hotkey for cycle wireframe page tabbing isn t sufficient Maybe your current upgrades don t crucify me etc
Are you saying that some mechanics feel like unnecessary APM sinks I definitely always felt this way about larva injecting
koreans have personality
I don t think the issue was ever personality but language barrier culture mostly language barrier tbh I see this a lot on reddit where someone s like WTF KOREANS HAVE PERSONALITY AND ANYONE WHO SAYS OTHERWISE IS A RACIST Yes of course they have personalities they are human beings personality just comes with the package of being a person No one should ever try to argue otherwise that d be retarded but I don t think anyone is trying to argue that Hydra lives at the ROOT house he s a hillarious dude and a homie Polt s stream and MC s stream are both super popular but those are also the guys that speak english and try to connect with their non korean audience through streams and social media they do their interviews in english a lot of the time they put themselves out there where most KeSPA koreans don t outside of KeSPA that s all edit decided to write a bit more on the subject and posted it on my twitter ROOTCatZ for anyone who wants to read that
what annoys me the most is that we are expected to be fans or feel very connected with players that really dont care about the foreign fans the players you mention care about their foreign fans and have accumulated a lot more because of that
It s almost like they re people as well
nah theyre just robots
There s only one confirmed robot it s Innovation
Likely in their native tongue they do
Most casters these days are pretty terrible I can t really think of any that I actually like based on their casting alone
ToD I ve never played a game of protoss in my life If there is a PvX match up however and ToD is a potential caster I am happy
This is how I see a lot of pro players turned casters Main race vs X Cast is good If it s not it s just horrible And if they dont keep up with the meta they just spout predictive nonsense that is plain wrong or doesnt happen and has gotten worse with every expansion
The accent alone
Very much in the same boat and I can t quite pin down why Could be that I know the game better than I ever have meaning that casters have less and less to teach me Could be that I m just tired of the stagnant caster pool we have today Could be that I don t need casters to excite me any more perhaps SC play by play is just done for me after five years Is it really just that they re all shit now Couldn t give you a straight answer
The current style seems to be to HYPE HYPE HYPE every single point of the cast Which makes everything sound fake to people who actually know what s going on I prefer to have 1 caster current player being super dry and analytical while another caster is there to play by play the right moments Like Idra Grubby back in the day paired up with a play by play guy was my shit
Oh god am I sick of the hype Every single time I watch a Tastosis cast I ll hear BEST MICRO IN THE WORLD BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD BEST TERRAN IN THE WORLD etc etc Just stop please
I like apollo and tastosis They are really the last good professional casters Even tastosis has lost some of their old charm though Now tournaments tend to just throw in pro players and fun personalities as casters HSC casting sounds basically the same as major tournaments which never used to be the case Casting was definitely a lot more competitive in wings
I just miss Day9
it gets me everytime i tune for one of the big CS or DOTA tournaments
In the past year or so the number of Casters that look uncomfortable in front of the camera has risen And the ones who are comfortable in front of the camera from practicing YouTube videos or Streaming are ignored and never invited to cast Or the community hates on them for what ever reason
maybe it s because they dont know shit about the game If i had to choose between someone who actually plays competetive and really knows the meta and somebody who just looks good on camera i would always take the player Especially because you don t even see the casters during the game Btw a lot of the current casters also stream Nate Rotti ToD
I ve never enjoyed casters who have nothing to say other than predictions of what a player is going to do or how a fight or game will turn out Like instead of giving us the background of the players and their careers info on rivalries what build a player is doing and why details about the match and matchup or simply explain what s happening with a reasonable amount of hype we get a constant stream of predictions from start to finish most of which turn out to be wrong Rotti Kaelaris and Apollo come to mind I think the best casters are Artosis Tasteless Nethanias and ToD I also really enjoyed IdrA s commentary for that brief time since I m a Zerg player
I watch less and less SC2 because of casters just screaming and trying to be cool with dank memes Running a joke into the ground for 3 hours isnt funny or fun
nathan is especially guilty of that altho he held back at DH I think
Stream Nate and Professional Caster Nate are very different Stream Nate is him fucking around having a good time Professional Caster Nate is him toning it down and taking a bit of a different approach to the game for the sake of being professional and catering to a much broader likely less knowledgeable audience Basically he can blaze dank memes all day on his stream because people are coming to watch him specifically He tones it down during tournaments because people are there for the tournament not just Nate I think he balances the two well and I don t mean to imply him having two different personas is bad or negative Many many people act differently in the comfort of their own home than they do at work especially if that job entails being in the public eye and trying to represent a brand company
no nate is extremely guilty of this at the last dreamhack he was terrible the TLO vs Snute cast was full of dank memes and screaming as a joke Nate still runs the ADAPT vs Adept name into the ground
agreed
The main issue I have with casting in starcraft is how a lot of casters will say something along the line of I don t know about this move but hey these guys are much better than me or If I was playing I would be floating 5k minerals and gas and only have 50 supply The occasional joke is fine but the constant self deprecation is obnoxious I ve only really seen this in SC2 Rarely hear it when watching dota2 or smash brothers
I think it s mostly done because it kinda feels weird to properly critizise someone who is magnitudes better than yourself They know how hard it is to pull of a game of their level makes the mistake a lot more understandable
bming someone based on their race makes no sense at all because 99 of the time that person has been playing that race for years and the current state of balance design had no bearing on their decision
It never makes sense When you complain about a race you are really complaining about your inability to beat it But of course it is easier to blame someone else than improving your skill in a certain matchup Even if you don t agree with this there is no excuse to be mean to a person you play against because of game design Your opponent did not code the game
Damaged Protoss buildings should leak that blue stuff like they did in BW Honestly winning as Protoss when all your buildings are on fire felt like such an epic achievement back in the day
If this opinion is unpopular I just don t even
Well it s clearly not popular how often have fans requested this from Blizzard
I like playing through the storyline
I think while a lot of people didn t enjoy the plot the campaigns themselves were pretty well liked
I don t think Protoss is cancer
You think Hitler thought he was a bad guy Get some perspective cancer jk I like Protoss now too
People make way too big a deal about balance changes They don t really affect the vast majority of players who aren t at the top levels
I can not stand Broodwar I like how Starcraft II dumbs everything from BW down with infinite units in control groups autocast worker count on bases auto rallied workers location hotkeys and multiple building selection The original Starcraft was so hard to get used to and made the game a lot less enjoyable for me The campaign was cool and all with its story but a lot of the missions were boring as fuck Escort missions really Also I play the game for fun This community seems to care more about the Esport side of SC2 than anything else I don t give a fuck about Esports I watch tournaments occasionally and I watch the highlights when I miss them But sometimes I just feel left out of this sub where most of the posts are regarding something happening in the professional world of Starcraft when I just wanna see gifs of interesting or funny plays
In broodwar s defense the technology at the time severely limited what a programmer can do honestly Back then it was revolutionary IMO
I m the same way with esports I do enjoy watching tournaments and pro games streams but just can t get into a lot of nitty gritty stuff This sub just loves the Pro gamers and makes memes and funny pictures about them but its just not for me
aliev gaem
This game lacks and should have a official Just For Fun player vs player game mode I m not talking about co op missions since it s co op Much like cs go has official game modes made out of mods from previous cs games why doesn t this game have a official Big Game Hunters or Fastest Map Possible unranked ranked for example
Team games are just for fun You can try hard at 2v2 if you want but everyone else is there just for fun Try trying hard at 4v4 no fun will be had at all
I think Blizzard isn t as simple minded as most people think There s got to be a lot more behind the company s decision making i m pretty sure Blizzard has considered 99 of the stuff people bring up that needs to be implemented and they have very rational reasoning behind delaying hotfixes not implementing new features etc It s a company full of experts who s job is literally to concern themselves with Starcraft in every single way possible I m not dismissing community feedback by any means but I just wanna say that they DO know what they re doing and people need to consider that blizzard isn t ignorant to whatever the community thinks needs to be done they know their shit Blizzard has ALWAYS been super careful with implementing features unless they 100 know it s going to work out they go about it this way in basically every blizz game around You can t just go around implementing all these cool features that would totally save the game because that s just stupid game design What I love about them is that they re realistic and skeptical about everything Maybe this isn t an unpopular opinion because perhaps just the vocal minority likes to jerk off to suggestions that would save Starcraft from inevitable death Or maybe i m just stupid Denno That was my unpopular opinion venting is nice
I don t think they are in touch with the game as much as they should be and I honestly don t think they pay as much attention thought as you re giving them credit for to what the community brings up There are excellent professionals and people in the StarCraft department no doubt it might just be an issue of department size or incompetence by the rest but things move very slowly around here we re 5 years into the game if you can t start trying things out now to turn things around then when
Maybe i do give them too much credit But still The average post on this subreddit containing a suggestion is always worded in such a way as if blizzard is a child that needs to be pointed in the right direction They obviously do make mistakes a lot of them evidently but they in no way have the level of ignorance that most people make them out to have Again i m talking about how the vocal minority perceives our blizzard overlords Most people are mature enough to know the difference between a global company like blizzard and a group of 16 year olds doing a group project for school In terms of their pace that you mentioned i dont know enough about the workings of blizzard either as to why that stuff is so slow The best we can do is give constructive feedback purely from a player standpoint and not go around playing game developer
The game is fun and enjoyable
Richard Lewis is the TMZ of the esports world Much as the sheeple who follow TMZ American Idol The Kardashians have below average intelligence so are the people who look up to Richard Lewis Tasteless uses hype to cover up his lack of game knowledge The main reason why he is a top caster is because he s part of the old boys club and his chemistry with Artosis If you take away his screaming during solo casts it becomes glaringly obvious If you re a small time streamer who is struggling to make it big you should viewbot intelligently You would be surprised at how many big time streamers used to do shady things to promote themselves before they got big Twitch is the wild west at the moment if the other streamers aren t following the rules why should you Go get yours
Game balance only affects GM level players
I think the game should be balanced around the top level but I don t think the problems players face during sub optimal play are uniform across the races or skill levels
I think lower level players blame balance because they lack the ability to see where they went wrong
Low level players usually point to game balance or particular units as perceived imbalance That being said creating a game where there is a low amount of perceived imbalance can be very very hard Given that people always assume their opponent is just abusing X mechanic
I disagree to this The top level is the most important but balance also includes lower levels The current state of balance in lower leagues especially in PvZ is horrible I think this is a base problem for new players to get in and thus for the community to grow
Some GM players will try to make strats work regardless of balance and many lower level players change their builds based on the most recent patch Balance affects the game more than just at GM
Players below rank uh am I 21 no 24 Gold League shouldn t complain about balance
You are on reddit You must be top GM
Those fucking scrubs

Terran is more annoying than it ever has been First the spidermines in HoTS and now Liberators
I think BW is massively overrated
There s never been drama in this subreddit I ve agreed with in 4 years I ve browsed Be it desrow djwheat anything tastosis anything naniwa lilbow whatever Nobody ever deserves as big amount of hate as they do here Twitter banter should be fun not something thousands decide to pick sides and make angry threads about edit never say never some small ladder hero related stuff has been deserved including hackers getting busted avilo s hackusations failing etc
My unpopular opinion is that the game is not dead
I think the main goal of balancing is to make the game fun before they care too much about it being balanced If a unit or strategy is fun to play with and play against balance can come easier as people are less emotional about their losses We have too many units that just feel very aggravating to play against but they stay in the game because they are balanced A lot of potential players stop playing very early on because of the abundance of very silly feeling losses
2v2 is more fun than 1v1
playing with friends is an awesome thing D the loneliness of starcraft can be hard for people to get over
Archon is kinda glorious when you have someone cool to archon with
Both warp in and pylon overcharge are fun and interesting mechanics
I think the warp in is an awesome and unique mechanic for protoss not to mention it thematically fits with the race so well Pylon overcharge is cool but by having it changing balance around it can be so tedious I dont envy the guys who having to figure out how to balance protoss It is such a massively complex problem
The same can be said for all races though remember bunker build time haha
I think Warp in is cool now with the long vs short warp ins but really Overcharge I dunno Shield battery is so much cooler imo
I feel like people overestimate how powerful shield battery was It was rarely used and really only was effective in small skirmishes in the early game Besides that photon overcharge and shield battery accomplish entirely different goals Protoss lacks dps with their tier 1 units and had trouble holding early pressure while playing a macro game Nexus overcharge solved this problem but failed to provide any interesting counter play to the other player Pylon overcharge imo makes both players make rapid decisions about all sorts of things and lets protoss set up strong defensive positions while not just making their whole base safe for a set amount of time
I think Photon overcharge is just straight up dumb What is the point of having a Photon cannon anymore 99 of the time PO will do it
depends on people but zerg is the easiest race and protoss the hardest for new players
That is an unpopular opinion
I thought Protoss was the easiest to learn but as I got more mechanically proficient zerg became easier
I disagree As a new player my experience so far has been that given new players tendency to float resources the production methods of protoss and terran are a lot easier to manage than the larva system for zerg The idea of knowing when to switch from drones to army units results in a lot of games where I either get blown up before I ve made enough units to defend properly or I march through their base with 1 1 roaches completely unimpeded Again new player so there s a good chance I m missing some obvious stuff
but then again you only need get used to injects and you got 80 of zerg gameplay covered till around diamond you don t have to know builds you can simply make what you feel don t have to circle around different building types set relay points you can add units to control groups as you produce you can make an army overlords you need nearly instantly got lot of vision
True But getting used to injects takes a good while And if you start missing them you re pretty much useless And while that freedom is really nice for a player that has more of an idea of what them doing it s a bit overwhelming for total newbs But then again the whole game is a bit overwhelming for newbs realistically I just struggled a lot and I feel like at least some other people had to have as well
you could say the same for warp in tho if you miss a warp in timing thats its unless you builds lots of extra gateways which you could do the same for zerg just with hatcheries
I like shitposts memes drama stories and witch hunts everything in small dosages ofc
SC BW UMS was amazing Heaven s Last Stand and LOTR
I never played Brood War and I don t care about it
Pylons shooting other buildings was a great addition to the strategic depth of this game
Brood War and all RTSs from that era gameplay aged as bad as a crack addicted whore and I wouldn t go back to play it for more than one hour if they were the only games left on earth
Kaelaris Wolf Brendan are utterly unbearable
Brendan has really come a long way Even if he s not the absolute best caster on a technical level or on an analytical level he s pretty likeable Never gets egregiously over hyped Never over steps his mark declaring things beyond his game knowledge without obvious self doubt At this point he is one of if not the least obnoxious casters in SC2 Would have been right there with you a year ago
He s the absolute caster on a technical level
When edits go wrong they go really wrong Fixed it now Thanks
couldnt agree more
I love watching mech turtle or otherwise
I absolutly love Artosis and Tasteless casting
Harassment and cheese are way too strong in low level play and make the game frustrating and unsatisfying for the majority of players The skill floor for defensive strategies like walling off and protecting workers should go down while the skill floor for harassment like oracles DT cloaked banshee etc should go up so that they re mostly used by high skill high APM players I also think that Blizzard has data that could support or reject this theory
This and the terrible terrible damage is what drove my friends from the game And that Terran seemed really bland as only bio
I can t help think what it would be like only being able to have 12 units in a control group It would make your deathball much less prevalent in LotV but still out there harder to control the more deathbally it got Also splitting up your forces to attack defend would be way easier to do since you automatically have 4 control groups for army
My favorite comps are Mech and Protoss
I don t think we should look at the foreign scene for balancing even if it s a premier tournament Protoss is so dominant and the Terrans aren t as skilled compared to Korea We should only look at SSL GSL and Proleague if we re looking into balance
That mech comps are perfectly fine right now in all MU s you just can t play HotS style mech
I m willing to sacrifice the entire foreigner scene if it means that the Korean scene can thrive Not saying that I think sacrificing the foreigner scene will help the Korean scene but at this point I really don t give a fuck about foreigners anymore SSL GSL Proleague for lyfe
Yeah I m on board with this unpopular opinion as well All I ever wanted was to see top level play I have no interest in watching foreigners because the play is so far under korean pros I try and just get bored and turn the stream off It also sucks to have region locked tournaments I got so much joy out of seeing 30 foreigners with a few good koreans mixed in and then watch them cleave through absolutely everyone to secure the top 4 spots It was like watching a cheesy action movie where enemies are just thrown at the heroes en masse I ll miss it sheds tear
I can get on board with this as well I really believe that those Koreans that traveled and beat the 30 foreigners were a real gift for the natives How can you expect to get better by playing the same mediocre players over and over This is why the Aus community is so shit in csgo A little side example because we have fucking no one to practice with and no one wants to come here because you get nothing from playing here The Koreans should encourage the natives to practice harder I feel like currently we re just giving foreigners a free ride into a top 4 spot for the sake of having foreigners Everyone already knows a Korean is going to win this tournament now we re just going to see lower quality games That being said the scene has to be built around what is most likely to attract viewers unfortunately that is watching a couple subpar players from your home country rather than watching the best of the best play the game at the highest level of skill we currently have to offer
Amen to that
Only one Personalities generally don t have much personality compared to an average Joe off the street They just seem to be passionate people who aren t good enough to play but rarely seem to be that interesting either I can name more interesting Korean players than I probably could decent personalities Casters and the like who passively aggressively talk about their audience and make stupid voices and try to mock them should be sacked as soon as the cast is finished I bet reddit is moaning about me now but I hate em lol nerds fuck them Nah fuck you mate you play to them when you need them and insult them when you don t Blizzard is the single most destructive factor in all of their modern games that they want to become eSports Gateway being removed be the start of fixing Protoss I would rather a Naniwa who tries to achieve something in adversity and bitches Than the average foreigner who wants to be given something in comfort and lays claim The sooner people stop reading personalities opinions and use them as an echo chamber the better Mostly because personalities either have their own stake in the claim or their head in the clouds ToD is the best caster right now and can articulate his thoughts better than the rest of the casters That is particularly embarrassing if you re an English speaking native As Apollo has become more confident on camera and in his speaking abilities he has become worse at casting Listen to Apollo cast 2011 2012 with TB or at the 2012 MLG s As good as people said Artosis was he was far worse than Apollo IPL was the best thing in the fucking world fucking love Moletrap man edit Remember the IPL 3 comedian His only funny joked make the audience very salty Which shows how precious people on the internet can be
loving Moletrap that is unpopular I did love him in BW though
absolutely agree on apollo
LotV is worse than HotS at least for Terran match ups LotV s new economy is a really poor solution to the problem of turtling but it DOES nerf turtling so people accept it
I don t think LotV has any maps out yet that have surpassed HotS maps to be honest The map pool is terible and is trash compared to Echo Catallena or Overgrowth imo
I think every unit should be designed based on a risk reward norm and the existing units should be brought closer to it Whenever a unit gets away from that norm they are either not used at all or used so frequently that they overshadow any other units and cause strategic stagnation The path to a balanced and fun game requires nerfs of the units that has kept them hanging in hard times For example boosted medivacs need to take a debuff and adepts shading also need to have a debuff Mutas need to not regenerate in every situation etc Also statistics are the worst possible eligible metric to determine balance and they should be resorted the last but everyone is so fucking keen on using them everywhere and they do not even do it appropriately
the foreign scene is dumb and doesn t matter and blizzard should put all the money into Korea
I liked the old swarm host
I actually really like the new one Kinda sad I never see it used though
People in a lower league are just as capable as offering advice and balance idea s as someone playing in pro league They may not always be right But they are not immediately wrong A silver player can still point out that a GM player missed an inject Oh and not changing the FOV for balance is silly the FOV was set in 1998 when screen sizes and resolutions were drastically different then todays Increasing the FOV by even 5 would be much nicer to look at
Why isn t Broodwar music played in replays and spectates
MLG stunted SC2 s growth all over the rest of the world by bringing Koreans outside Korea too early
The sad state of affairs in the foreign SC2 community is its own fault and its own fault alone It had every opportunity to build its own infrastructure leading to a sustainable scene and completely failed It deserves no support or money from Blizzard
Could you elaborate
You ve got to be joking Geographic conditions are why infrastructure for the foreign scene has utterly failed with the exception of France
I don t like most of the new LotV units It seems like they re all basically if you don t react 100 perfectly to this you instantly lose and I wish the game would slow down and allow people to micro macro their way back into a game from being at a disadvantage instead of being like wellp I guess you should have built 5 stalkers just in case of a Liberator rush Now you can t mine and the terran has like 25 marines that they re about to ram down your throat Or wellp you should have made a Trump wall and now you re going to die to adepts which teleported to both your mineral lines
I don t like tastosis casting Both are good but together they makes a bunch of jokes I don t find super funny and misses out on whats actually going on in the game Especially in hots I they always mentioned how we just need to wait a few minutes before anything happens so we can make jokes They could use this time to discuss the map potential strategies details around scouting Theres so many small things thats not too often mentioned regarding openers
Photon overcharge on Pylons actually adds interesting strategic thoughts from both parties
Something changed in the flavor of the game when HotS came out Wings of Liberty looked and felt like Starcraft A lot of things were comparable versions of Brood War The first expansion added all of these new things that totally changed the way you had to play the game that I had just spent the last few years learning how to play and improve Let s be honest most of us aren t Diamond or Platinum players I was Gold and the change killed my motivation to continue
Protoss design issues stem not from warp gate but from a fundamental lack of stability in gateway units they lack the collective mobility sentries zealots which aren t currently charging adepts not using shades stalkers not blinking and reliable DPS everything even adepts versus light to stabilize the race
Mutas are op in 3v3 and 4v4

But for me it was Tuesday
I don t know I posted a picture of my dog on here once That was worse I think and it s my second highest rated submission on reddit
Holy shit That is a top tier shit post I wish my shit posts were that good
I don t understand how someone would take the time to make this upload it and submit it here And then I understand even less how this is getting so many upvotes
I upvoted it because me and my GF broke up a month ago and now I am GM Why wouldn t I enjoy this post
Well I m not saying that you should not enjoy it or trying to reduce your enjoyment out of this post I m saying that I legitimately have no idea what is enjoyable in this post And it is by far the top post of the day Maybe there is some inside joke that I m missing
I find it kind f funny how often there are posts which are highly upvoted but everyone in comments says it s a shitpost It s almost like the people that spam the voting button and the people that take the time to articulate their response into words are not that overlapping and the latter have higher standards than the former
At this point I feel like it has been satirically upvoted This is the only explanation I can find
You should have seen this forum back in 2010
I m not that old
News and discussion posts were basically 1 of the content not exaggerating All other posts were image macros one liner jokes and screenshots There were several polls about whether to try to make the sub more discussion related but it didn t even seem remotely realistic It was basically shit post central
Your tone suggests you didn t think it was glorious
I still feel dirty I even made a rage comic
Idk I feel like image macros weren t as big of a thing on reddit in 2010 Maybe there were more things unrelated to starcraft posted but I think at best it was fruitdealer level shitposting We ve had years of people polishing and perfecting shitposting Innovation levels
r DotA2 would like to have a word with you This shitpost isn t even a essay 5 7
A perfect score

I mean r dota2 is entirely shitposts with the dam leafeator ancients guides

Nah We re at like 20 r jontron levels
I dunno that redhead is damn cute
why cant he mean epitome
Because you can t reach an epitome An epitome is just an example of some set of things a person or thing that is typical of or possesses to a high degree the features of a whole class Dictionary com It is often misused to mean the best of a set of a things perhaps because that definition is easier to understand Google says epitome means the perfect example however the perfect example would represent the most typical object in a set rather than the best This is because the perfect best thing itself would almost by definition be atypical the best case is usually the rarest and not a good example of the set You could even argue the best thing is the worst example of the set since it is so atypical

that guy is hot though
I m the other woman in your relationship with starcraft my ex
I dunno about you guys but this is the kind of shitpost i can get behind
if he s asked he ll do them What s so difficult to understand
Well I imagine he isn t cheap He is one of the more experienced hosts compared to someone like smix Hope to see in at least one event this year
redeye for global finals or ealier D
Worth every penny IMO Redeye is the best bar none
Everyone wants to help smix get exp believe me
smix worst host ever rofl
what exactly does this mean is he creating his own WCS league will Redeye host the upcoming IEM is Redeye declaring his own country where he will only host sc2 events Does this mean redeye is coming back as an sc2 professional is Redeye going to take over tastosis job as gsl casters
Dang you make some really good points
I m in support of all these Except maybe the last one gained my love bk for them recently
Well tournament organisers GO FOR IT Redeye seems like an outstanding guy and I ve always been able to enjoy his professionalism on screen He knows esports inside out and I really appreciate the effort he has put in over the years
PLEASE
Yes please Him and Chobra are easily the best hosts would love if Redeye could come back and host starcraft 2 again
I think Richard Lewis and Incontrol both really good hosts and they are as good if not better than those two for me
Richard Lewis and Incontrol are good for Dreahacks and more casual stuff I would never want them hosting something like Blizzcon
i would not call DH casual these days
So causal it doesn t even have a stage for us Kappa
So casual it doesn t even have the best players
Incontrol yes Richard Lewis definitely not
What s wrong with RL s hosting He s a really good and generally well respected by analysts Desk Host
Let me explain how it works If you dislike a person everything they do is bad and will never be good no matter what
Honestly the issue is more that RL is nothing but bad press at the moment The last time he was in the spotlight it was for antagonizing a player over twitter then getting violent backstage when that player took up his invitation to come find him then he had the gall to at least initially blame security for letting that very well known player into a backstage area he didn t technically have permission for He s also a writer for breitbart because they ll let him pursue a particular antifeminist agenda that right now is anathema to the kind of mass market appeal a global eSports host needs to have On top of that his content is very visibly banned from one of the largest subs on Reddit It s brand suicide to associate your premier event with someone like that regardless of whether you hate him or you re his best friend Even if in the short term it gains viewers RL is just too likely to sink his own career and then you re stuck with his face on all that hype footage you need to edit for the next event
ehh at least get it right He wasn t antagonizing a player the player was antagonizing him and telling him that he would be meeting up backstage
That s not even misquoting that s an outright lie RL posted a joke about a sign at an event the people responsible for that sign took offense to the joke and RLewis tweeted this at him You can see on the same link that he baited loda further In his OWN ARTICLE on the subject he then explains I replied that I would be working on stage which he would not be doing as he had been eliminated from the tournament the previous day Provocative I know But I couldn t help myself I also urged him to do whatever he planned quickly this was as much about wanting to get on with the show as it was about showing I am not someone who will be intimidated AKA he antagonised Loda Loda then shows up backstage As invited in the smug confidence that security would stop his invitation being possible and then From what we witnessed it was Richard who initiated physical contact Loda could be described as in his face but did not initiate physical contact As a result Dreamhack have banned Richard Lewis from their events indefinitely None of this is the kind of press that Blizzard or anyone else wants at their event Even if RL still has a fanbase the fact that over time he s proven himself to be a magnet for this kind of trouble getting himself banned from DH r lol fired or pressured out of a bunch of positions while writing for various companies etc That is not the kind of CV that lands you a hosting gig where the single finest quality you can have is to be personable and appeal to everyone It only points towards an eventual self destruction that could damage any brand around it
Everything I ve said is true and you re either deluded or can t read I m done feeding you
So basically how this reddit views non Koreans
That was really the weirdest thing about the whole affair At literally every single point RL had the opportunity to say something less dickish and put a stop to all of it Then after not doing that and making the first physical move he wrote an article about it where he just basically threw a big non sequitur in the middle for the sole purpose of being angry at feminists that had nothing to do with anything
wow got a bunch of down votes shoved up my ass for giving my opinion S
I think when RedEye left Apollo was the one who was supposed to take care of hosting interviewing players etc What ended up happening was Apollo casted way less games than before and he only took care of panel hosting That s it It almost felt like we lost two ppl instead of one I want those two back
Still better than Apollo is Incontrol Hes out of pro playing sc2 so maybe he will host more tours
Redeye NEVER left
he left esl not casting lol
Apollo is a better host than a caster IMO
I appreciate you opinion and most humbly disagree Apollo OP
He is a damn good caster But he s by far the best host out of anyone other than red eye and I d say he s a better host for WCS or IEM because it has a more polished feel as a tournament vs say HSC or Dreamhack and Apollo brings a more professional feel than redeye I d love to see Redeye do Dreamhack
ROFL
Redeye Redbull Profit
Is Redeye still at Gfinity
http telkomgaming co za behind the lens of redeye In 2016 Paul made the decision to go freelance again to give himself more flexibility and the chance to host more events His twitter bio no longers mentions a position at Gfinity so I would assume he is not
I hope to see him back in the SC2 scene but feel a little sad that Gfinity didn t work out That was a big move for him that was based on providing for his family
don t think there s reason to be sad it was apparently his choice http redeyehd co uk 2016 moving on
well that escalated quickly but maybe we will se apollo commentating again instead of hosting now
Apollo is a solid host IMO although there s something special about redeye hosting he combines casually professional presentation with sarcastic humor in a way most people really can t manage
yes he is solid host but he was the best caster in the world at his peak not for everyone of course that would be ridiculous if everyone liked same thing but most people saw it that way I dare to say
For Counter Strike I imagine for those wavering their Tastosis pitch forks
I really miss Apollo casting
Apollo is a solid host and redeye never really knew what was going on in the game but and thats the important thing Apollo is great at casting and we want him back at that
Apollo is a great panel host because of that but stage host redeye is the best and redeye can host multiple games without breaking a sweat
http redeyehd co uk 2016 moving on
Retire is being taken pretty lightly these days I see
Man Redeye is such a boss He is such a nice guy an experience hoster and even can handle idiots pretty well D
I was at this tournament The stage was set up in the middle of a fan convention with dozens of other unrelated busy things going on around it I don t fault the guy too much for walking through the camera shot but his reaction is way uncalled for Funny awkward moment
He s not going to Shanghai for the dota2 major so i guess he s available
He is booked in March for the CS GO MLG Major
We love you Redeye
No can you understand implications of simple sentences jesus
Two words Yes Please Sorry 3 more words Collectors edition drop p
That would be amazing Redeye is a real pro and has a great personality
I miss Redeye
aliv gem
Waow this clickbait title
I hope not He was always so out of place like someone s dad had turned up and started dancing at their birthday party

Basically he got drunk and puked on the couch
Amazing
It really was actually
Here are the real ones http wiki teamliquid net commons images d d4 Stephano WCSEU2012 2 jpg http wiki teamliquid net commons images 0 00 Stephano WCSEU2012 1 jpg That he also was an outgoing guy who mostly gave a shit about political correctness wasn t a bad thing If I would have been able to kill the entire scene just by talent at this age I would probably make the same mistakes It s all good Stephano was is the best foreigner ever
Everyone loved Stephano because he could fight the koreans for real Now his attitude and personality made him much more popular but if he had been a mid tier foreigner I dont think people would ve cared because of that alone
Absolutely There s tons of mid tier Europeans and NA players I don t care about most of them because they never showed potential to take on Koreans for real
or when they showed some promise they bitched and refused to practice Koreans spend too much time practicing We need team houses Korea is just better so there is no point to practice
Personally I am dismayed with the WCS changes as I want to see the best players Koreans compete as much as possible However I understand that not everybody feels this way and that a significant portion of the fan base would like to be able to relate more to the players This typically means watching players who are more emotionally expressive and communicate directly with their audience minus translators While I have no qualm with this and I believe that the end of the year Olympics type event has its own appeal I am worried about whether or not the WCS changes aren t shooting the scene in the foot in the long run via severely limiting opportunities for Korean players and possibly stifling up and coming KR players TL DR With GSL and SSL reduced to 2 seasons per year and eliminating the ability of Koreans to play in foreign tournaments the improvements to the foreign scene seem to have come directly at the expense of the KR scene Could there have been a better way to complete these objectives
I would say Koreans would need Korean only qualifiers if they wanted to compete in outside tournaments while still keeping some region locking there At the same time eliminating invites to most tournaments The health of the entire global scene cannot have the influx of Koreans dominating tournaments like in previous years without giving something back to the region those tournaments are in If Koreans want to compete in WCS Global they would need the valid visa and add to the ladder practice of the other regions they would live in 100 wins is way too little something like 300 500 wins games per season or month on possibly a non barcode account so that they improve the quality of ladder The ladder is where most players get their practice from and obviously that means that the Korean ladder is the best The Korean scene also needs more things like the Olimoleague but that has to come from them wanting to do it A lot of non Korean small organizers have their small weekly cups for non Korean players and that is a great way for smaller players to get exposure experience I would bet that is why EU has always maintained a somewhat healthy playerbase while NA is slowly recovering from WCS 2013 2014
His comparison to the olympics is perfect What event does every basketball fan watch Not the olympics they watch the nba finals What would that be in Starcraft Not blizzcon but the kr gsl or ssl finals Nobody really cares about the olympics in basketball it s just a bit of fun It doesn t help us find the best players or anything People want to watch the best compete
Would the best not be competing in RO8 at blizzcon
The best compete and qualify through GSL and StarLeague then proceed to play very one sided matches against foreigners at Blizzcon
Well I m not sure that answers my question Leaving aside whether the matches will actually all be one sided Bly and Marinelord showed that Legacy may not be all that one sided so lets see even if the Koreans stomp the foreigners in the RO16 you still get to see an all Korean RO8 Again is that not the best competing There s a balancing act of making the whole scene sustainable and making games available for different viewers not just those who want to watch Koreans I ll gladly watch GSL SSL for Korean sc2 but I d also like to watch other players compete even if they aren t top in the world
Correct These people are letting their pessimism affect their thinking
It s the same at the start of every expansion sometimes there are balance issues and sometimes foreigners have figured out something that is not in the Korean meta Once the meta settles in Korea mechanics trump all and foreigners can t hope to compete Mark my words Blizzcon will be a bunch of Korean s roflstomping foreigners just like every year before this one GSL SSL always have and always will be higher level tournaments
Hopefully But if the purpose is to find out the best players in the world it should be designed for that And if you throw in 16 foreigners with the 16 players you are trying to see who is the best of that makes it an objectively bad tournament If that s not the purpose of Blizzcon that is totally fine I just think that it s a weird end of the year event because for me that should be all about answering the simple question who was the best this year
That s two different things If you want the one best player in the world then the blizzcon will give that If you want the best 16 players in the world then you ll already have that at the gsl RO16 Personally I don t think there s any right answer there just need to be interesting tournaments and enough content for viewers Some people only want to see the very best of Korean players go at it which is fine there is gsl ssl and proleague for that Plenty others myself included also want to see what the best each region has to offer I don t want NA and EU to end up being a Korea part 2 and Korea part 3
Yup I get it I think some people just want to listen to the casters they like cast Starcraft and don t even care much about the players But I think my perspective of just wanting to find the best players is extremely common as should be expected because that s what most of us are used to from our competitive sports leagues
I think that really depends on the sport if you re talking about traditional sports leagues Fans will be hardcore supporters of their local clubs nations or teams like football rugby or cricket and will not care if the team they support is not top tier
Yeah that s a good point
Nah its going to be random group drawings and somehow be all korean v korean and charity case vs charity case in the Ro16 to get some diversity to the Ro8 Ro4 Finals
They system for Blizzcon RO16 this year is different Instead of 1st vs 16 etc in a bracket the RO16 is a group stage with 2 koreans and two foreigners in each group Seeding for that may be the same idea though Best foreigners vs worse Koreans and so on I don t really know
The point is why watch 8 Koreans play when we could watch 16
It may not be the majority preference on this sub but I don t want to watch just Koreans
so youre going with last years blizzcon with the amount of changes that have been done to keep a white guy relevant in this game Watch Blizzard is going to change it to keep the white guys around
I like how it s to keep a white guy I didn t realize that outside of Korea were only white people Making it a racial issue when it s really not
Blizzcon 2013 2014 and 2015 actually I don t get what you mean by keep a white guy relevant unless you re trolling I m just taking your argument to its logical conclusion and saying that all foreigners will get knocked out of RO16 if Koreans really are universally better
It s just like how Korea was supposed to win Nation Wars fairly easily especially with Innovation on the roster and non Koreans are supposed to be trash tier right
You do realise I m being sarcastic back at this guy right
Oops sorry wrong person to reply to
Except its not perfect Starcraft would be a single event at the Olympics where there are qualifiers for based on performance and stats compared to the other countries countries who compete need to qualify for the olympic level unless they are the host country and get an automatic qualification spot Its why you dont see Team Saudi Arabia in Hockey Hell South Korea has given citizenship housing and money to some very very very low skilled Canadian and American hockey players so they can try to qualify the team for the olympic level and put a showing when SKorea hosts the olympics
but neither gsl nor ssl reach the amount of hype there is at blizzcon when you win a gsl or ssl you are awarded a spot at blizzcon not the other way round the WCS system leads up to the blizzcon finals just like the NBA regular season leads up to the playoffs Saying nobody should care about Blizzcon is a really crude assessment
But that s my point The construction of the wcs just doesn t make sense as a viewer because the playoffs in the nba puts the best teams against the best teams blizzcon is nothing like that Imagine watching the nba regular season and then at the end they just pick some good players that season and we watch the olympics It s just awkward as a viewer
Imagine watching Champions League and at the end they all just picked the best of any given country and did something like the olympics calling it something goofy like world series Or imagine if the NBA didn t allow foreign teams to compete
I hear you I imagine the design of WCS is intended to promote buy in from a wider region globally Consider how playoff seeding works in the National American Football League 12 total teams seeded 6 teams seeded per conference 4 divisions per conference where each season s division winner gets seeded 2 wildcard seeds per conference where best non division winning records get seeded This allows representation from each division and to an extent region More vested interest in a team more viewership The 7 9 Seattle Seahawks won their division and beat their opponent in the wildcard round in 2011 this also helps to create storylines and hype Olympic seeding varies per event golf seeding takes the top 15 in global rankings and then 45 others based on global rank at a max of 2 per country
Except blizzcon does pit the best against the best because in all likelihood there will be a all Korean top 8 Your metaphor is close but not quite there
As does something like the Olympics in the later stages of the events such as quarter finals and beyond Domination of a handful of nations in for example hockey does not prevent Poland from sending a team
Not for long because there currently isn t really any way for new young talent to come in Korea You are getting what you want for maybe a year or two at the cost of the Korean pro scene There are only 2 seasons of major tournaments for Koreans now Even the stable pros have just lost their stability if they have a bad day they only have two more chances to prove themselves for the rest of the year In Korea everyone has to go to the military meaning everyone will retire at some point There will be no scene behind them as the stability of LoL is much more appealing to their youth than a game where they only have 4 realistic chances to compete any given year as an unknown
Its too soon to predict the overral sc2 popularity rises or falls till we got to the end of this year While this state will definitely foster young talents in non korea region we are on the trend losing most beautiful plays from the best sc2 players since 3 4 years from now Maru Life Sos Soo Zest are going to retire and nobody is going to receive enough support to be good enough to replace them Maybe in the non distanct future we are going to see foreigners dominate the scene since all we have left of koreans are B level players like Salvation Speed Sorry if thats what you want to see in the future
Why would they retire The main concern is the potential lack of support for new talents in korea And it has to be adressed everyone agrees on it It has already been pointed out in korea and people will for sure work on it as it has been stated in a recent tweet
Everybody is talking about growing new talent in Korea how about growing new talent outside of Korea The basis for the perceived WCS injustice toward South Korea is that Korea has over the years produced too many proplayers starting in the early days of WoL when it was apparent many Brood War amateurs and B teamers wanted their piece of the pie that was denied to them by KeSPA KeSPA was regulating the market so that only the best could play ESP and GOM were far more permissive The Korean proplayer pool got bigger as a direct consequence of the WCS system giving them room to expand No room in GSL Just go over to WCS EU or NA Can t qualify for Code A Attend a Dreamhack for easy money Leenock and Patience were perplexed over the ease at which they won their MLGs and Dreamhacks Now Korea s SC2 ecosystem can t support this many proplayers thus the retirements and problems finding new blood Koreans were able to multiply in the previous system at the expense of foreigners and their region s growth It s quite remarkable that we have as many fresh faces among foreign SC2 pros as we do That s not to say there are many of them but it s not catastrophic
I totally agree with the new WCS system and has always supported the growth of an healthy foreign scene So you don t have to preach me Concerning the lack of talent in korea my only concern is the way the pie is distributed between players If they can adress this concern I ll be really fine And extended format in proleague or whatever for the b teamers having a chance to shine would be a start But all in all it is up to Kespa and the tournament organisers in Korea to make a move
I totally agree with this And now that hopefully the foreign scene is fixed or at least kind of and can grow again the korean scene surely also needs and will get some love in future iterations I don t see any reason why everybody expects GSL and SSL to be the only solo tournaments this year More smaller cups can already be in the making or can quickly be initiated if the fanbase in Korea desires it
I agree If there are really that many viewers that want the best of the best play all the time surely they could crowdsource a tournament or a league for those korean players Its not like blizzard is hardcore controlling the scene the korean players can play other unrestricted tournament Blizzard is the only one putting in the money which is a lot at the point especially when he game doesnt even have microtransactions and everyone else is telling them how they should spend it
The USA in the Olympics along with other nations like the Soviet Union come away with the majority of the gold medals and crush the other countries Wow must been a llong time since he watched ordinary sports Infact he must have been in a bubble since 89 was he even born then
Haha I live in the past xD I forgot to include Russia in that really so I edited it But truth be told The Soviet Union in it s previous iteration did dominate lol
China would ve been a better present day comparison
I honestly thought the Soviet Union thing was a cheeky joke
Community is concerned about state of Korean SC2 Reduced amount of tournaments new system promotes best players more money less tournaments lack of any reason why young Koreans should go pro with this system Instead WCS casters are talking about why tournaments they cast are awesome Then they are mad why Reddit is constantly mocking them or saying they hate Korean region and Koreans This is exactly the same situation like constant iNcontroL got a raise mocking They ignore community s concerns and just talk about why something different is great
thats nice and all but have you heard about our local heroes
Some part of the community not all community
Have you read the article Kaelaris actually acknowledges and addresses the problem you ve stated at the end of his post
All he is talking about is TLO s tweet
Just to reinforce this point As much as yes there are only two scheduled SSL GSL Seasons this year I personally don t believe the Korean scene is going to spontaneously implode in on itself ProLeague is a very important part of Korea invitationals offline IEM Taipei and online are still most certainly a possibility AND reality I may be totally uninformed because i m not in Korea however we re told that people are working on making sure new talent is found Also the recent wave of retirements in Korea are far more coincidental than people think I don t believe WCS 2016 plans were a major reason for those retirements Let s put it this way even Gods sometimes don t like change
What do you think about the new Blizzcon and the fact that it has been won three years in a row by koreans who didn t place top 8
I personally tried to address the matter here EDIT no one cared D if you wanna leave a feedback will be appreciated https www reddit com r starcraft comments 42m04q maybe an idea to fix the shortage of blizzcon
An 8 player invitational 2 of which aren t korean and 2 are foreigner favorite personalities with big streams doesn t do anything to help the KR scene
Everything is fine guys

I am actually in favor of region lock Really I believe most people are What I m against and most complaining is too is region lock AND reduced amount of tournaments for Koreans I had no problems with 2015 system when they kicked out most of Koreans out of WCS and in return SSL was created Now there is one less season of GSL SSL region locked weekend tournaments and even bigger rich get richer prize system than before Why should I be against region lock if I LOVE Proleague No I don t want to lose Proleague players in favor of WCS Especially when there are barely any new faces in the scene
Beautifully written
At least I know I moan like fuck
koreans have 8 spots the rest of the world has 8 spots which will probably field at least 1 2 koreans I don t see the problem here
I read all of this in kaelaris hypevoice I whole heartedly agree tho
See what it says in the corner of your paycheck from SC2 and then try writing that again
It s really hard to take these opinions seriously when they come from people who don t even play the game He talks about the levels of play between foreigners and Koreans but he s not in a great position to do so
I d wager many of us here don t play the game or don t play it any more Sure a spectator can readily see the difference between korean and foreigner play just as a sports fan can easily have in depth knowledge of teams and players in their chosen sport
And him not playing the game affects his opinion on the organization of competition in Starcraft how He s not talking balance design nor really talking about the game itself rather how Blizzard and other organizers have come to organize the competition
Very good writeup Thank you for sharing I think the foreign changes are very good The Korean scene obviously needs more help
Couldn t agree with you any more Kaelaris great read
We ll give the system a chance because we never really had a choice in the matter Money power does what it wants till crazy kills the money and or power
Give this man a shoutout
who listening the guy who casted hots full time and was not loyal to SC2 through which has the job
Yeah Chanman if this is just Thooorin and Richard sucking each other off that ll get pretty boring Best is when they have people to argue against
I think it would be more interesting in general if Chanman would just start expressing more of his own opinions and stop being just the guy in the back waiting for other people to say interesting things He needs to be more than just the boring referee Say something interesting for god sake
He should take more the role of the devils advocate In fact I actually think Thorin does a very good job on his show SI where he frequently will offer counterpoint or force the guests to elaborate further on their opinions
So much this Chanman needs to not only be the one hosting the discussion but he needs to actively participate in the discussion
Problem is that Thoorin will rage quit if you argue against him
This episode is gonna be too annoying to watch if no one is there to counter Thorins perspective on the WCS issue
I would but Thorin told Chanman that he s too scared to go on shows with me He doesn t usually like to talk to people that can articulate alternate points of view and prefers to scream down people instead
So wait they kicked you off the episode to get Thorin on What makes people think his opinion your opinion I bet you have things you want to say about WCS too
There will be 2 different types of Unfiltered Destiny will be on every 2 weeks
I know it s 2 different types just thought it was the same crew and they made an exception since Thorin was on But I guess that makes sense
Thooorin works for Turner Broadcasting TBS TNT etc for the Turner ELeague He s very very qualified to talk about esports Much more than Destiny I enjoy and am entertained by both dudes but Thooorin is way more of an expert on this kind of stuff It s sad they can t get along a bit better though but strong personalities can sometimes clash
Well I was more talking about WCS but I like Thorins rants it s just I d like to hear what Destiny has to say too Even if he isn t an expert
I mean Come on dude We all know Destiny can gather enough experience himself to hold a conversation with Thoorin
yeah he can be expert on every topics if given 2 hours
Yeah ok On most things he talks out of his arse but I think something he has worked in isn t a bad one for him to talk about
Yeah I wasn t saying he couldn t hold a discussion I think more their personalities and previous experiences wouldn t let them hold a good discussion Might be entertaining but probably not good I m just saying if you have to decide Thooorin or Destiny on your first show about esports I d take the guy that has a deal with Turner Broadcasting first
It s a completely different thing we re asking for then I want Destiny and Thoorin both to be on because despite them both disagreeing they have in the past both actually made for good debates Thoorin at times has been extremely rude and curt sometimes same as Destiny has told people to kill themselves far too often
its the first episode so no1 have been kicked
Oh I thought Destiny would be co host on this too
I figured that much he will rant and shit on SC2 without anyone challenging him and his bulshit
The same can be said about you prefers to scream down people instead
Destiny doesn t scream he just talks fast and aggressively rubs his nose
damn thorins a bitch
So what about TLO
Thank you fuck Thorin Like before I started watching you I kinda thought you talked out your ass but as I watched more atleast you usually keep an open mind Thorin is so fucking stubborn and ignorant I can t handle it
Oh yeah Some really articulated alternate points of view https twitter com OmniDestiny status 691311510975594496
http i imgur com Tnikb67 png The full conversation
thanks for making this
I did not make it i got it from here https www reddit com r Destiny comments 42hf6k twitter autism
Thank you for showing this I had almost forgotten why I stopped watching destiny years ago when he told me on stream he would cut out the autism jokes
He said aspie instead of autism thats a first
Top notch banter mate Love it

Thorin pulled the niveau to that level Destiny can out shit him no matter the level
Dude I love Destiny but don t tell me that he sent 11 hilariously dumb tweets because of Thorin It like when Thorin said Destiny baited about Poland
What I didn t said that I just said Thorin pulled it to that level that Destiny has no problem to follow him is given see the first few tweets http i imgur com Tnikb67 png Thorin just got what he asked for
Ok My point was that the show won t be very constructive with Destiny because they both love mad banter
Bullshit They obviously have strong opinions on the matter Let s see who has the better arguments Would be very one sided I guess but it should happen also just to shut this stupid case Letting Koreans suck out the whole scene obviously isn t the best for the system and for SC2 world wide It s only good for Koreans and not even that is true in the long run it would be suicidal also for the Korean SC2 scene As we have seen the last years
I totally agree with you we need that discusion but I think Thorin is too salty about Destiny and I think that Destiny would love to trigger him But I am maybe full of shit and they are grown up able to have a good discussion together
They would knew what they are up to this time Might involve some salt but I think that could be a good discussion The one thing that might hinder it could be that Thorin would have to admit that he was wrong what I think he isn t able to do
But Chanman said it was because you don t like esports anymore
It is just going to be Thorin and Richard Lewis jerking each other off while Chanman sits there and watches
Maybe chanman can compile the part from the interview with carmac and kealaris his pov or maybe get him on for that topic
My thought exactly But looking at twitter not many brought counter points other than insultes
Not having the one starcraft player on the show when this episode is likely going to have a very strong discussion about the region locking is a humongous mistake I would take Destiny on to talk about WCS over thorin talking about literally anything else on a show that was so heavily SC biased in the past I ll be skipping this one EDIT for what it s worth I m still a fan Hope the episode still does well
I really am not interested in Thorins personal opinions so I think I will skip that
Okey you are not interested in his personal opinions but rather other peoples personal opinions If I understood you correctly
Yup Pretty sure that s what he meant I am not interested in Thoorins opinions either
a richie lewis and thorin episode is a pass fellas
https twitter com Thooorin status 691315561670770691 lol
Honestly I don t know why anyone in any Esports scene asks for Thooorins opinions
I mean the guy have a phd in e sport history
Oh god another show with both Thorin and Rlewis These guys circlejerk whether right or wrong the same opinions This will become a rantshow rather than a discussion show I am only gonna watch this if you get someone with actual counterpoints
So is Chanman just gonna do his while chanman thing where he never takes a stand never says anything that s even slightly controversial and is generally leaning on someone else to be the color commentator
Thanks chanman for giving one more opportunity to RL and Thorin to jerk themselves off on another talk show they are not doing it enough already
Watch as a LoL CS GO personality disses the SC2 scene Nah I think I ll find a better use of my time
Unfiltered just got filtered with the exclusion of Destiny
This is going to be the most filtered Unfiltered episode Can t go too ham or Thorin might lose another job
Might as well call this show filtered if thorin is too much of a chicken to have destiny on
And you actually believe that s true
It s pretty obvious
Really Because Destiny said so What if Thorin says the opposite will you believe him Who do you choose to believe Is there any proof from either side
If I remember correctly chanman told destiny on stream that thorin did not want destiny on the show
Yeah but not because he s a chicken Do you even realize how the episode would have been with these 2 people in there at the same time Besides Destiny wasn t even supposed to be on this show as it was about esports He is only there for the non esports shows
Won t watch Thorin without Destiny being there Thorin needs to stop being a pussy ass bitch
No destiny
Thorin wont work with Destiny and Destiny isn t too interested in general esports topics and Thorin is still one of the best analysts Seems reasonable to just have Destiny on for drama streams
Destiny would be very interested to be on the show Otherwise we will get buried in shit from Thorin
Not even sure why this is mentioned on r starcraft
Because it s a Starcraft show quite obvious if you re visiting r starcraft from time to time
esport show Thorin hate sc2 He like koreans BW
He doesn t hate sc2 he has done a ton of coverage on sc2 before
All coverage he s done for SC2 are purely for career purposes He s openly stated or at least it s publicly known he doesn t like SC2 at all
No it isn t a Starcraft show it s a general eSports show with 3 people mentioned who spend their time in the LoL CSGO scene
Really then it s strange that this show is pretty much unknown outside of the Starcraft scene And these people have all been active within Starcraft earlier as well
Have you watched the show since it relaunched It pretty clearly isn t a SC2 show
My argument still stands
Listening to Thorin actually causes me lose so faith in humanity and go into an existential crisis Tempted to listen in but without Destiny there the back and forth with Thorin and Richard Lewis will be too much for this delicate flower to handle
Chanman so beta he literally filters a host off the show called Unfiltered
Polish people are potato pickers Thanks Thoorin
Thoorin Richard Lewis and Chanman with the only SC2 opinions being Thoorin s dumbassery Easy pass
While I m all for stirring up some shit especially on Unfiltered fuck RL and fuck Thorin They talk so much for people who don t know anything Didn t know chanman wanted to see these fellas beat each other off
Good The esports stuff was the only thing I watched it for
How much SC stuff do they talk about now Not whine just curious
zero since non of them care about sc maybe richard a little
im sure sc2 will be discussed
inb4 extra guest is Destiny Kappa
Please change remove the current maps You don t even have to create maps or do a TLMC Just copy the maps from the korean scene they look awesome
Could we have an update on the progress of the ladder revamp Community Feedback Updates going by and not mentioning it is frustrating
I would love that too Unfortunately i don t think they ll talk about it
I think if we can show them how important it is to us they ll respond
I d think they d already know by now how important it is not much more we can do I guess we could pay pro s to type in chat in tournament games Give ladder revamp over and over again
The answer will be We are looking into it we hope to have an update soontm
I wish we could do something more constructive than whining on reddit to show blizz how important it is to us
We ve showed them how important all those things they ve promised to us are Which is why they promised them to us Now we get half assed community updates Half assed and delayed balance patches
How can you still be this fucking naive If Blizzard cared about what was important to use LotV would ve been released with the ladder change already in place with voice packs and skins etc They don t care
Caring is only one of many factors that lead to changes in Starcraft 2
So then what would the other factors be The only reason for Blizzard to bring in the ladder change would be for people who already play own the game The ladder change isn t bringing them in any more money So if it isn t gonna make them money and they don t care about the playerbase then why would you expect them to have it out any time soon
This is a very large change as such it s likely they don t want to have to keep tweaking it so the time spent in decision making considering the motivational effects it has on the player base and trying to find the absolute best implementation is a factor Another major factor is the time spent implementing and internally testing the top ideas It will be necessary to develop new UI as well as more back end type coding to get everything working Its been a habit of Blizzard to try and get things right the first time taking longer to put out a game or feature because they do their best to make sure it s the right call What Blizzard is fairly new to is the level of openness transparency and community involvement that some AAA game companies are adopting and having success with Which is why I m reaching out for an update for information It s most likely that development is happening but I think it would make everyone feel a lot better if we had an update on the progress
Okay thats great and all But if this was something that was important LotV would ve been released with the ladder changes already implemented If this were actually important to them and they thought it would be good for them to do it they would ve done it before release and would have used it to pull people into the game Releasing it several months down the line after the hype for release has died off is not something you do with something you consider important
Holy hormones
over in r heroesofthestorm dustin browder just confirmed that they are working on a ranked system aswell but its not weeks but months away being top priority tho https www reddit com r heroesofthestorm comments 42n0c9 dustin browder on twitter rolling the season
over in r heroesofthestorm dustin browder just confirmed that they are working on a ranked system aswell but its not weeks but months away being top priority tho https www reddit com r heroesofthestorm comments 42n0c9 dustin browder on twitter rolling the season
Frustrating but also good sign Isn t blizzard known to release only when it s perfect If we re in this scenario I don t mind waiting But yeah a little update would be nice
Didn t they say fairly recently it is still a while off
The main problem with the current ladder is you have no idea where you stand You might be top of your division number one out of 100 but actually middle gold Meanwhile someone ranked 50 could be very close to being promoted Points are there just for divisional ranking whereas your mmr match making rating determines your opponents and promotion but that number is hidden A second problem but related is you can feel like you are grub ng away with no sense of progress no real goal Once you hit gold the league is so huge you play and play win and win and still are not close to promotion A goal of platinum could take a few seasons or years so van be demotivating The new system is supposed to solve these Each league will be broken into tiers No divisions of 100 but instead ten tiers per league The tiers apparently based on mmr If you get to tier 1 then you know that you are legitimately in the top ten percent of the league You can set smaller reachable goals Also since your mmr is visible you can tell directly how you compare to other players by skill
Yea a multi tier system solves a number of problems Not least of which many more increments of progress I have been in Diamond for 5 years At times i know my play has stagnated and even regressed and others times i know for sure it has improved i broken into Masters once after the decay put me back in Silver I have to say being in one league for the past 5 years feels pretty worthless Another thing they want to add is if 2 players are on the verge of breaking into a new league they want the preview to show it s Promotion Match
OK that makes sense My initial thought was Well maybe that guy s skill still fits best as a Diamond Surely if his win rate is 60 or better eventually he will hit Master But damn if I was in one league for 5 years I would at least want to know if I was making progress It could be hard though you know when Blizzard makes this MMR and league thing more visible people are going to eventually start nit picking and pointing out how certain things don t make sense still I feel like Blizzard has done a great job overall though
thx for looking it up
I totally agree Yesterday on my stream I went thru all the community update because I forgot when he said he would revamp the ladder I m pretty sure at first they said the ladder would be revamped for the first season of 2016 probably during the blizzcon multiplayer Q A but then after saying what they were planning on doing he said they would do it next year That s so vague and frustrating
Wow so we really aren t getting that revamp
I really don t know why I bother getting excited for any changes in this game
It s okay to get excited just do it because of a blue post not because of speculation
I can t believe so many people got excited for skins and it turned out to be one skin that was bundled with a 3 part DLC pre order
Blizzard announced at Blizzcon that the skins and voice packs are coming after the Nova DLC
They specifically said after the dlc T T I have to wait so long
Really the Expac has only been out 2 months they are still working on balance y all need a bit of of patience Rome wasn t built in a day
people who play this game seriously don t give a fuck about skins The other way around
Let blame Lycan
So negative One skin is announced so far Just because there is one announced in no way implies others cannot come later which is what they said in the first place
We get a lot more support than most other popular games and we take their communication for granted but I can t think of many other games that have to deal with broken promises on a monthly basis sometimes more They make so many empty promises and they delay things for years Who in their right mind thinks it is okay to delay something for years
At least they finally implemented the show offline buttom they promised us 4 years ago kappa
At least we have Facebook integration My mother s cousin s niece would be pleased to see I played 30 games of SC2 yesterday
I don t use facebook do we really have this
I don t either and not anymore It used to be a feature way back in Wings of Liberty The running joke was something like We can t be invisible we have no chat channels there is no social system but good thing Blizzard added Facebook integration
Source
Wait we have facebook integration That s pretty pointless
I added my cousins boy friend on Starcraft REALLY REALLY BAD IDEA LOL
The deckslots are right around the corner
This is pretty much the same ladder post they make every season It implies copy paste more then it implies no change That being said I m not optimistic
When can we be optimistic when it s blizzard
Are you pessimistic about the new Overwatch Do you dread each new patch to WoW Stay frosty man
The proposed ladder changes are front end only so of course mmr won t change The fact that they ve been silent on the later revamp lately is the indicator that no revamp is coming soon
MMR won t change and how MMR is calculated won t change when the ladder revamp comes
They said you can now not be demoted but wasn t that already the case before the season lock
You can t get demoted mid season Or at least couldn t
You ve always been able to get demoted mid season It all depends on the stability of your mmr
no you havent blizzard got rid of that in 2013 except for GM You have always been able to get promoted however
Well I haven t played since 2012 except the past couple months so that explains it
Mid season GM players can be demoted This only happens if their bonus pool gains to many points After ladder lock they cannot be demoted since their pool no longer grows So after ladder lock no one can be demoted
Wait what I thought the season ended on 1 30 at least that s what it kept saying on the play screen I just spent 5 and a half hours playing nonstop today trying to get into Plat and it turns out it was all for nothing I feel like crying
its cool man in a week you can get plat 100 i believe in you
Thanks Honest question though why lock the ladder if the season doesn t end for another week I mean other than just playing for fun to improve that means there s no reason to play during the next week
its just to give people a chance to catch up on bonus pool and get a realistic rank in their division for their skill level well as far as i know thats the reason
I ve never liked that reason Which is why I am excited about the ladder changes whenever it happens Would much rather see my MMR I don t want it to be like how LOL does it with leagues though where you have to get a certain amount of points then you re bumped up Cause in promotions you HAVE to win a certain amount of games out of 5 and it s stressful and awful If you don t you have to re qualify for promotions and ya it sucks I think I just want a range of MMR that correlates to a league maybe I dunno I haven t said anything about the ladder revamp til now but I kind of wish we knew the format that it d when it comes out I hope they somehow keep leagues the way they are get rid of bonus pool but I feel like alot of people will be stuck at 0 points if they go 50 50 So maybe if you won you get more points than a loss I guess it doesn t matter to me since I m towards the top of the ladder but I want it to work for everyone
Well the season DOES end on 1 30 This season is still happening you just can t get promoted
Exactly I m asking why it gets locked a week before the season ends Why aren t we allowed to try and get promoted until the last day
That I have no idea about it always was weird to me
I wanna get some new maps but I also hope we can keep Dusk Towers that map is easily my favorite this season
Why did anyone think it ll ready for the first season Honest question At Blizzcon they said the ladder revamp will be coming this year but no specific dates and knowing Blizzard It won t be ready before May June
i really hope that we re getting some news on the ladder revamp in the upcoming days leave league bug still being abused team game matchmaking is nothing but a joke since hots 3 0
Oh we ll get news on it 100 will But will they do it Idk my hypothetical grandchildren won t live to see that balance patch from DK
Why do they have to make a post on this it doesnt make any difference
really good invites but im sad its only an 8 player tournament
Would have loved to also see marinelord and showtime amd uthermal there But more can qualify no
Says it s an 8 player tournament no qualifiers
Should be a fun tournament Sad its only 8 players though
I don t understand why only 8 Games in LotV are so much faster in comparison to HotS You d expect twice as many
Im soooo glad to see Soulkey and again And ByuN is there too also dont forget the Bosstoss
Top Korean performers of the 10th Intel Extreme Masters season will compete along other legendary players for a 25 000 prize pool Not sure how I feel about Lilbow being legendary
His Blizzcon performance will go down as a legend
Indeed not all the legends glorify their characters
Yeah he really doesn t deserve to be there I bet he s already practicing for Warcraft 4
First Foreigner to go to blizzcon since a long time Yes he did bad once there but still
Did bad as in literally didn t practice for the single most prestigious important tournament of the year and then was made a fool of because of that All while making foreigners look like even more of a joke Yeah I guess he did bad
dont forget basically failing everything he practiced for he hardly did well at GPL too
We re not gonna discuss this again he played one of the two best player of his time who know what would have been able to do another foreigner He made a choice maybe a bad one but at the moment he was a legend among foreigners
Why was Lilbow invited He s practicing for Nova Covert Ops missions
Monday and tuesday early in the morning when in EU
rip
I would get up and tune in if there were more fresh faces to watch Snute Polt and MC can fuck off they always get these invites
looks sick but the timezone is going to kill me
At least 4 players I would count to the top notch But seriously this is what is left of IEM World championship Saddens me
Hey atleast it s better than the 32 B E S T P L A Y E R S I N T H E W O R L D
That statement was really dumb
Why I say a lot of dumb shit but I don t think that was one of those times I m just making fun of how ESL first announced the Katowice event and that I personally prefer watching sOs ByuN or SK over many of the players we ll probably see at Katowice
I meant the statement BY IEM not you p I guess I wasn t clear on that
Ah ok No need to worry my shitposter honour was not hurt at all
It was 100 a subjective opinion It more so speaks to your intelligence that you attribute intelligence to an opinion
Except he didn t
No qualifiers or anything So these players are being invited to come get free money
Yes invite heavy only tournaments have been around forever IEM does it a once or twice a year
sOs fuck yeah
holy shit AWESOME
Congrats herO on winning IEM Taipei
You mean o
only 25k o needs at least 100k to win
His winrate is clrealy proportional to the prize pool in thousand dollars So 100k 100 winrate giving him a 25 chance to take first place
That actually makes a lot of sense
you mean ByuN
Yep
In his dreams this goes to ByuN
In an online match I d give the edge to herO In an offline match it s not even a question Byun has severe nerve issues while herO is a multiple time champion
ByuN has shown far stronger form in LotV than herO though
herO won the GSL pre season tournament
But he also lost the first round in the ssl
I guess one bo3 trumps a tournament win
why is lilbow invited to every fuckin tournament out there like srsly there are so many players that instantly come to my mind life maru inno ty basically every Korean that are so much better than him and if it is for the foreigner pride why not invite someone that actually stands a little bit of a chance like Marinelord or Ptitdrogo or Bly Srsly I just don t get it this guy seems to get an invite for almost every lotv tournament out there just because he was the last good foreigner in HotS and even then he got absolutely demolished by a Korean
Not only does he not stand a chance he already proved he d rather give up before ever trying to play against koreans
Because of how everyone is reacting Guaranteed views
MC vs sOs sadly for MC
Reasonable honestly Lineup is reasonable It s not only the best and the finest but it s not an 8 player foreign handout either Snute and Lilblow have had reasonable results to show for I can accept this it strikes a decent balance between skill and fan favourites
Come down people If the top koreans are as good as you say there wont be any foreigners in the semifinals and if we see Lilbow or Snute in the semis they can t be all that bad can they I think it s stupid that only eight 8 players are invited tho I think something like online qualifiers would be a better solution
Lilbow Legendary player What is this crap
Pretty iffy on the Polt Lilbow and MC invites but the rest are solid ByuN Soulkey and herO enter as obvious favourites Given the upcoming patch really not sure who I d give it to Should be a good n
Watching Polt s stream I m not too worried he almost took down Rain in the WCS Finals if he hadn t done that proxy rush and MC has done well in LotV I do agree on Lilbow hasn t had much success
Lilbow has no real chance If they wanted to invite another foreigner I would rather had seen someone like drogo who seems to be in much better form
I agree but their goal is to attract viewers and Lilbow is more well known
give maynarde pls
Well i would have prefered Maru Inno Life over Lilbow Snute MC
deleted
This has nothing to do with the WCS system It doesn t give WCS points
The spots should go to whoever the organisers see fit
BYUNBOYS
they shouldn t make it this easy for Byun
BYUN IS BACK BOIS
hope to see Byun play VS all 3 races nice field
Yes MC HYPE
I think they meant to say sOs herO partinG Maru Inno Taeja Life Solar Byul
Error 503 Connection timed out
Meaningless Invitational AKA Only chance for Koreans to play besides the so far non existant WCS Global events Still invite Lower Quality European Players GG IEM
Snute has proven time and time again he s capable of taking games and series vs the best I understand the argument of Lilbow more but Snute Cmon man
Lol MC Polt and Lilbow invites rich getting richer It pays off to network in this scene
Lilbow does exactly nothing to network lol
deleted
Talent wise sure but I can tell you which one will have better viewership
sOs will have nothing to do for 6 months they said
No wcs points
WCS points are fairly meaningless for sOs now anyways
Well how could anyone know he would be invited and this only fixes the problem for one player who randomly got an invite
I was more alluding to the point that people have been saying that top Koreans like sOs who don t make it into gsl ssl will have nothing to do for 6 months And yet here is an international tournament inviting Korean players Some chill is needed all around
Kinda confused why they invited Lilbow think he ll even try
I think this is going to be a rather boring one
I don t want to be rude but it seems like there is only list of players nicknames without names or races they play meanwhile there are all details regarding talent crew and even their photos http en intelextrememasters com news announcing the players broadcast team format and schedule for starcraft ii at intel extreme masters taipei It looks kinda strange to me
There are probably so few good Kespa Koreans because they have to focus on SSL and GSL
herO and sOs are the only good players invited rip
wat ByuN Soulkey do you even watch pro SC2
pro olimoleagues you mean
Well he did knock down soo in SSL
8 player invitational so why there is 4 protosses This tournament supposed to be only for koreans and still they invite 2 foreigners but why Lolbow ffs
Who said it was only for Koreans They invite who they want to and having both Koreans and Foreigners gets the best ratings
Compete ALONG other legendary players Never said those legendary players had to be Korean
Legendary player here is for example MC who is retired at this moment If you consider Lilbow as legendary player our discussion end here
I think the problem is your definition isn t the same as theirs But they never said it was only Korean you just assumed
This is scalating quite quickly People just seem to dont understand that all this WCS tournaments acts like regional leagues If foreign scene was big enough i m quite sure there would be like in other esports a chinese european north american and south american league Where for example the european players wouldnt be able to play the iem san jose and the chinese players wouldnt be able to play the DH Valencia Exacly like Fnatic doesnt play LCS NA in LoL or Barcelona doesnt farm the MLS in football or San Antonio Spurs doesnt farm the euroleague in basketball The problem here is that the foreign scene is so weak that it must act like it is a sole region This gives us a scenario with only two regions Korea and the rest So this is not bullying Korea it s just having two regions because foreign scene can not be splitted in more pieces
he went full on sjw This isnt racial segregation simply the fact that the whole rest of the world gets more spots in wcs
So the WCS system and the StarCraft 2 Fans are literally hitler Sorry no
Ugh linking things to Apartheid is as bad as Reductio ad Hitlerum Shows complete ignorance of Apartheid and the struggles that took place To compare the victims of Apartheid to Pro Koreans being left out of a tournament is just insulting to a ridiculous degree Fuck this guy
No offence to petraeus but this is basically the equivalent of a 1st year student grasping at some straws comparing two vastly different things in their intro to soc class I d give it a b for effort and the fledgling critical thinking but holy shit its so misguided
Quite agreed kind of made me think I thought he was like smarter
First thought that entered my mind
Must agree Makes a stretch to a horrible injustice in history and links it to regionlocking a competition I don t understand why people have such problems with this LCS was always locked allowed limited imports and the local scenes seem to have developed well because of this It s like saying its racist if an american team can t compete in the european championships of a given sport If Norway was allowed to compete in all local skiing competitions all other scenes would die
Its a stretch to play the race card but to bring up apartheid is a real head scratcher And MC is Nelson Mandela being a twitch streamer is his prison Glad to see this type of shit posting is getting laughed at

Saying Koreans are excluded from the tournament scene is a damn lie comparisons to apartheid are shamefull The fact that Polt Hydra and Violet are not considered true koreans should give some a good reason to pause for thought The purpose of the region lock is purely in the intrest of competition Playing the race card what an eye roller
I can see what Pet is saying but it s not like Europeans can come and compete in NA or vice versa It s more about regional based play which almost every other e sport has enforced If you want to play in a region you have to go live on that region We didn t ban koreans for dreamhack But they made the commitment to live in the region they want to play in get the visa win the amount of games they need to on the ladder and then they re allowed to play in that region It just looks bad because we re trying to back track from an open model to a regional model It s going to hurt for a bit but people will come to realize this is how it always should have been and why WCS in 2012 worked so well We saw Idra beat I forgot his name a gsl champion or would be gsl champion soon after that tournalent in macro games at the world champs and even beat stephano Then we saw him take on Rain and take a long macro game off of the scariest protoss at the time I think everyone else kind of floundered but it was fun and so hyped to see these heroes from these different regions taking on all of these titans from across the world I loved that tournament alot of it cause I m a huge idra fan boy haha Edit it was roro and I forgot that idra beat hero as well But I forgot so many other players from around the world like vibe suppy lowely vortix scarlett illusion and just so many other players Here s the pagehttp wiki teamliquid net starcraft2 2012 Battle net World Championship I also forgot suppy almost beat parting the guy who won the whole tournament That was right before suppy decided to put college on hold for one year to go pro And he kind of got fucked cause of the new WCS system
Very articulate article from Petraeus I can t believe when I see comments like Koreans have no personality on this subreddit from people who genuinely don t believe themselves to be racist There s no reason we need to separate players based on country of origin in a world where you can play someone thousands of miles away in seconds
Most emotional winner I ve ever seen was NaDa after years he came back to the top again when everyone counted him out he came back and won the finals Before that his father was just recently killed by a drunk driver he wrote an open letter to the sky my dad was very strong he wasnt skinny like me he was big and strong he never lost vs people i realize it now now now i realize yes i have to wake up again having no practice now is killing me if i go back to seoul practice hard so no one can beat me and for sure i will dedicate all those winnings and honors to my father i im going back dont worry im going back to the real nada so remember i will take care of my family dad Exactly 16 months later NaDa won the tournament It s my first time shedding tears after winning the league This is the best day of my life I am so happy I have never been happier I never knew it would be this hard to climb all the way back to the top after having hit rock bottom He cried well not full on crying mode but Idk what else to call it on stage for the first time I couldn t watch it live but even watching it later when catching up with BW I don t think I ve ever seen any this emotional moment by a foreigner
well to me foreigners these days have no personality either so
THIS It would be huge for SC2 for even a medium level personality to win a tournament
It s just that it s clearly not actually racially based it s linguistically based Not a coincidence that the Koreans with the most foreigner fans are usually the ones that speak English And there doesn t seem to be any shortage of fans for people who are racially Korean but live in Canada or the US and are fluent in English You can say it s discriminatory based on language but there s just no basis to actually call it racial when people love MC JD and Polt and MaSa is a foreigner This doesn t mean I agree with the WCS system right now I certainly don t But it is a matter of them trying to foster things in different regions it s silly to say its racially motivated
Fine then make it linguistically based not regionally based Make it so you need to pass a language test to play Then those who can speak English can play while incentivizing those who can t speak to learn You can t change your nationality but you can learn English
I don t agree at all with Region Locking I don t think we should restrict it in any way I m just saying it s not Racism because it doesn t target a race
No it kinda does It s splitting the competitive system into 2 parts the rest of the world and Korea How is this not racism
Because it s not based on the persons race A Korean person born in Germany US or France would be allowed to play And a Chinese person born in Korea is also ineligible to play So again the rules are absolutely idiotic but they are not based on the person s race and therefore by definition not racist It might be some other bad word Nationalistic Anglocentric Eurocentric but not Racist
Somebody of Korean descent born in Germany isn t Korean they re German Similarly someone of Chinese descent born in Korea is Korean This is totally racially divided let s not kid ourselves
No that s Nationality not Race To be racist this would have to attack people of Korean descent not Korean Nationality Someone of Korean descent born in Germany is a German Citizen and Ethnically Korean Racism is discrimination on an ethnic level Nationalism is discrimination on a national level So it s nationalist not Racist And since the real situation here is it s actually an issue of a language barrier it s most truthfully Anglocentrism Learn which term applies to which type of discrimination
Whatever it is it s discrimination and arguing what form of discrimination it is is stupid It s still an awful thing It still shouldn t be happening We shouldn t be taking food out of Korean mouths just to feed less skilled foreign players
Yeah is definitely shouldn t be happening but calling it something it isn t and not calling it what it is is also quite stupid If you don t call it what it actually is then you re going to end up thinking the problem is in the wrong place You wouldn t call it sexist or ageism or homophobic call it the correct thing
Alright I ll concede that Edit It s not like it s any better that it s not racist and simply just bigoted and nationalistic In any case the tangible effect of the rules are literally that only Koreans are affected or close enough to only Koreans which still sucks
Yeah not any better than racist necessarily but it bothers the fuck out of me when everything is racist if people keep just using that for everything then it means nothing when something actually is racist I also think bigoted isn t correct for WCS bigoted is being intolerant to people based on their beliefs opinions lifestyle etc I would say the best title here is Anglocentric because it s the ability to speak English that determines which Koreans are able to get and maintain fans and since primary sponsors are delivering mostly English based messaging that plays into it too So it s more of a non hateful but discriminatory attitude as a result of a language barrier
Also while the rules themselves may not be racist the underlying motivations may not be and reactions of huge swaths of people right in this comment section were anything but
I didn t mean to imply Blizzard was racially motivated They are doing what the player base wants which is a little bigoted in the sense that they are making it harder for players from Korea to be successful purely based on their country of origin I posted above how it s very easy to see the emotion purely visually and would be interested in hearing if you agree that it is enough
I mean but you could rather turn it around as well couldn t you Because I m not from Korea I don t have access to their infrastructure aka ladder and being able to communicate with other Korean players and thus my road to being as successful and as skillful player as them is incredibly difficult Players born outside of Korea experience have their own disadvantages as well Those disadvantages have been pretty well documented through the years Koreans are undoubtedly the better players overall and due to that it made it extremely difficult for non Korean players to be successful I don t necessarily agree with the way Blizzard is handling WCS 2016 basically barring Koreans from playing in WCS Global but anyone should be able to see what they are doing which is protecting the scene outside of Korea If Korean s would have kept dominating I m pretty sure that the non Korean scene would have probably kept shrinking and shrinking and SC2 would have been fairly similar to SC BW was like outside of Korea
It s they re doing it because they re trying to develop the under developed regions though then it s not bigoted I think it s stupid It s a bad idea but it s not bigoted it s driven by a totally different motive
No dude Koreans are a different race therefore the reason they have less support from the foreign community is RACISM There can be no other rational explanation it MUST be racism the new WCS system is literally apartheid South Africa and we as the foreign sc2 community need to sanction Blizzard so they can end their racist bigotry
I m not sure if I m supposed to read this sarcastically or not
I appreciate the sarcasm Next up calling david kim hitler
Nice why not just call him Jong Un Kim right
That s not how it works It s a matter of communication if they can t speak english they can t market themselves The few koreans who have learned it relatively well has almost automatically become fan favourites I don t think anyone believe koreans has less personality in some kind of race perspective
There s more to personality than language I watched with everyone else as Soulkey visibly became distraught after losing 3 straight games to innovation before making the greatest comeback in GSL history as well as his tearful winners speech following it Flash being so upset after losing to Gumiho he refused to come out of his booth Parting thanking his mother and jumping into the pool at HSC These are obviously just a couple examples in a sea of great Korean Starcraft moments and I must be watching a different Starcraft from anyone who says they can t identify with Korean Starcraft I get what you re saying and I understand we can t stop people from favoriting players from similar backgrounds to themselves but it s no reason to impede another player s chances at success due to his country of origin
I am happy to have won today I am disappointed I didn t play better I will try to play my best for the fans https imgur com R3wLBS5 Personalty at its best And that is when speaking Korean on their own soil That said look at tennis There are like what zero players today with any real personality But people find a reason to support different players Often that reason is nationality And it is often sheer brilliance of the player That is why I am able to support Neeb despite hating protoss as he is from the USA I support Polt because he calls the USA home But I also love love love watching Maru and Innovation Brilliant play Giving different regions a chance to grow and shine is good for the game Nearly every other sport does this in some way Other esports do it as well This is nothing negative towards Koreans What other country is guaranteed eight spots into Blizzcon There is a new super bowl between SSL and GSL this year twice This gets the top players the extra money they want and the fans a showcase of the best of he best There is good for both sides of this system And if there is one thing we should know is true if this doesn t work out as Blizzard plans they will change it next year It s evolving and Blizzard wants this to succeed It is obviously in their beat interest for the GE to grow and succeed worldwide
Most of the no personality comments I ve seen were from WoL and most of that was because there were very few Koreans running around the western scene early on When we did see them they stuck to the same interview answers I will try to give my fans good games Cheer for me This was probably because many of them didn t speak English motherfucker and they were probably a bit out of their comfort zone Do you really still see people posting that Koreans have no personality often I feel like I haven t seen one in years
I still see it all the time I downvoted a thread yesterday that said something like finally someone showed some personality when they won or some shit like that It s definitely still around and it s just as gross and ugly to see about this community as it was in 2011
It doesn t sound that gross to me Go watch Drogo s winner s interview with the sound off and tell me how much excitement resonates from it If Koreans can t express how they are actually feeling because of a language barrier they re not going to show much personality after a win other than maybe a fist pump or smile or something
Your definition of how to show excitement are not universal Koreans should not have to assimilate western methods of cultural expression for you to be able to comprehend their emotions
Only if they want to appeal to a western audience
https www reddit com r starcraft comments 42k4zq huk post about wcs changes No personality team out in full force here
Not actually seeing much of that at all in there Maybe you could point some out if you have the time
Some general racism some no personality https www reddit com r starcraft comments 42k4zq huk post about wcs changes czbis6j https www reddit com r starcraft comments 42k4zq huk post about wcs changes czbckw4 https www reddit com r starcraft comments 42k4zq huk post about wcs changes czboxk5
None of that was racist unless your definition of racism is this kind of reverse xenophobia stemming from distress that people from your part of the world are getting constantly shit on for years
you do realize that they re agreeing with the comments you quoted and will therefore defend their racist opinions to the last The alternative is admitting they re racist and wrong which is something no one wants to do they ll fight for their mild racism until they die which is sadly the only way to get rid of racism a lot of older racist people will die by the time we re old but its only going to diminish the racism because there are still young racist people everywhere as we see on reddit
That doesn t really look like racism Your definition of racism is pretty broad to the point where it s not really worth anything You might as well just call it people
https www reddit com r starcraft comments 42nsd7 esports apartheid critical opinion piece by czc2xd9
That wouldnt be a problem There are other sports where top player rarely say alot in English or have a really broken english The biggest issue have been the translater who have not been able to cater the koreans personality to the audience Especially when Host and Translater have been one person this became a big big issue But orgs never really cared about that they took the cheap route buying Smix for the double role and didnt care if koreans could show their personality RedBull 2014 was different and much better in that regard
Sure but people still get cagey about the idea of polt or hydra winning tournaments purely because they re Korean and we know how much people love polt There s a sense that being Korean is an unfair advantage
The main reason for that isn t because of racist bias it s because we need to prove this system first All the naysayers have said that these tournaments will just become easy pickings for the few Koreans that are here We want that to be prove wrong and for these Koreans to become maybe a favorite but a much more equal contender so the naysayers will just shut up about the system
Who has said Koreans have no personality That s pretty bold if you ask me Nevertheless I d argue it s more about that they can t connect with that personality due a language barrier
The language barrier is the real issue especially because translators tend to make all their replies sounds exactly the same The Koreans who do speak English usually never get grouped in with their souless Koreans Dude s like MC and Solar stand out more to western audiences
It must ve been quite a rush for the young Mackenzie Petraeus Smith to discover that he could do a whole lot more with his brain than just play video games all the time Shame it had to be a misguided comparison of a video gaming league with Apartheid ROFL
The consequences are obviously incomparable but there may be a similar thread of racial prejudice being dismissed as something else
I m not going to defend this change like it s the best thing ever But calling it apartheid is just wrong And I think something has to be done to help the foreign teams get to a level where they can compete with Koreans I want to have a local scene of professional players who play StarCraft for a living If that means having this sort of region lock then that sucks but it s a necessary evil we will have to live with until a better solution is found
That s a fair opinion but it certainly is choosing a healthy local scene over fair and equal treatment I think it s hard to spin away the fact that a race country is being discriminated against based on their place of origin
The point isn t the country of origin But it s just a fact that Korea has an established scene that makes it possible for players to flourish and become insanely good while the foreign scenes are much weaker and make it harder to grow as a player If European players had the same level of infrastructure support and funding as Koreans they would be competing at a similar level after some time
If we re talking about fair and equal Korea has a healthy local scene with good local representation at the highest level of play why shouldn t every other region in the world be allowed the same
I don t think that works foreign players are allowed to compete in GSL afaik and they certainly haven t chosen one specific country to disallow
Foreigners are allowed to compete but it s not an even playing field and it s pointless to pretend like one could ever be established The WCS region lock is an acknowledgement that foreigners simply do not and cannot compete with top Koreans and that it is futile to try and encourage such competition at all other than on an limited basis I like rooting for Koreans but the foreign players are being completely shut out in their own local tournaments There s nothing fair about this when it happens again and again and again for years on end
That s a bad use of the word fair in my opinion If a player is more skilled I don t see any unfairness in them winning
We communicate using words because words mean things we have agreed on Koreans are not a race They are a nation This is not racism and it is not apartheid These are charged and incendiary words and it is flat out wrong to use them and intellectually dishonest Now if the best foreigner was an American born to Korean parents and he was excluded from events and shunned by SC2 fans as faceless you might have a point for racism But we already have popular Asian players who are not Asian born or have been long time western residents so that shoots a hole in that theory The token Polt is in the system because of historical curiosities Had Blizz region locked WCS out of the gate there would be no Polt players like Polt ForGG Violet are not token they have simply been extended a courtesy instead of been sent home packing
I think you re using a more serious form of the concept to trivialize this one We don t have to call it racism we can just call it prejudice or discrimination You shouldn t be afraid of those words because they happen in smaller ways Not every mention of racism is on the level of lynching It s very real that careers are being taken away from people based on their country Whatever that is I don t like it much
Unless you believe all Koreans are of the same race which is wrong this is not racism no matter how hard you try This is discrimination plain and simple It s never had anything to do with race Also geographical restrictions to prevent underrepresented nations to lose motivation have existed in regular sports with tremendous success This is not apartheid A black could never play rugby in the same league Koreans or to put it better foreigners will have a chance to play Koreans at the end of the year in wcs globals Koreans will have more spots by nation than foreigners
K I already said we didn t need to use the word racism so I ll skip all that Do you have an example of a sport where one nation was singled out and not allowed to participate The other examples I ve been given have been about isolationism which is different edit at least give me an example with my downvote
You re fixating on the distinction of nation vs region A nation is a region so the analogy applies Soccer has regional tournaments It s only every 4 years that all nations get to play on a tournament together for the best The same thing applies to the Olympics Then there s also a limit of participants per region like in skiing competitions I m sure winter nations would win a the time if winter sports didn t limit by participants even if they end up winning the competitions anyway The current system implemented in the WCS is a hybrid between multidivision sport leagues and geographic protectionism This is because Korea is both much better than the rest and also a single specific region The current wcs system creates two parallel leagues so the rest of the scene can develop throughout the year and compete by the end of the year against the supreme players in a similar way to NCAA teams not having to compete against NBA players Yes Koreans are being discriminated They are discriminated because they are better but not just because they are better Korean eSports scene is at a whole different level Players in other regions don t have access to the same resources the same coaches the same funding or good practice partners It is self sustaining and that s the biggest reason It is a calculated risk I hope pays off As of right now because of the lack of opportunities for underrepresented regions in StarCraft and the lack of new narratives we re in a downward spiral for StarCraft as a whole You can see it in these forums all the time People keep reminiscing I see a light at the end of the tunnel though
I don t need the basics explained The fact that they are discriminated against for whatever reason is the problem I understand that people in this thread don t mind but I don t think it s a good community if we think it s okay to single out a group and treat them worse simply so the rest can prosper at a lower skill level This will shut down careers of better players to serve the careers of worse players I m not hung up on region or nation I m hung up on the difference between isolation from everyone and choosing one country to single out and treat worse I don t think I should need to say that multiple times am I being unclear in that distinction
They aren t treated worse they are treated differently If anything it s about treating foreigners better Koreans still get more money than last year You just want them to be able to farm foreign events because they clearly dominate the competition It would be like banning the NBA from competting in non NBA tournaments because they would rekt the competition and just walk away with the money In that case the NBA would be discriminated against as well Guess what viewership matters There is nothing fun in watching uneven and predictable competition and viewership numbers have shown that Either we level competition to allow regions that lack the infrastructure to get better or we say good bye to the international scene As simple as that You can cry foul all you want but the point is moot Also Koreans don t need your handouts As I said Korea s esports scene was born without foreign money and they will continue to exist long after foreigners stop supporting it if they do Korea never needed us foreigners to help them make a better scene They built it by themselves In a few years all this arguing won t matter anyway Either this shock therapy was good enough to revive sc2 and bring it to 2010 levels or it would have died and Korea will be the only source of games just like it s been for broodwar
Well Canada in Hockey in many situations The Spengler Cup for instance it was designed to promote hockey in Europe and for decades Canada wasn t able to participate they are now allowed to submit 1 National team of Non NHL players The World Under 17 Hockey tournament has Canada split into 5 regions Atlantic Quebec Ontario West and Pacific and are put into a tournament with 5 countries This is an effort to make it fair for the non Canadians and help develop their youth hockey programs The NHL briefly did their All Stars games as North America vs The World You see and hear a lot of discussion about how to deal with developing Women s team sports too They have a tendency to be dominated by the US and Canada Softball for instance now has locked regional events for Europe The reality is usually that most sports are actually region or nationality locked even at the highest levels because their highest level are still country vs country I m sure the Netherlands could have 100 people qualify for Olympic speed skating and the US women could probably send 3 teams and win Gold Silver and Bronze at once but they get limited spots based on that nationality I still don t think its a good idea for WCS but it s far from an unprecedented thing to do in sports
The spengler cup seems like a solid example Splitting up the country doesn t though Wouldn t that be like splitting up Korea into regions The all star game seems like a bad example too That s one single game not a circuit of tournaments
I didn t mean it to be examples of exact mirrors to WCS just situations in which geography was used to intentionally disadvantage one dominant region to help develop others The 5 regions certainly does do that because it s a team sport if those 5 teams could be 1 team instead then Canada would never lose so they were broken into regions as an intentional handicap Sports is full of developing regions being protected from much more developed countries in that sport
Thew New Zealand National Basketball League has a restriction that no team can have more than two imported players to stop local talent being entirely pushed out of the league by American college players who didn t make the NBA and Australians flying across the Tasman for the off season Is that Apartheid too
There s no Blizzard to try to tell us that the New Zealand basketball league is the best of the best and that it needs more money pumped into it Also the world basketball championships aren t half NBA teams and half NZ teams
There s a subtle difference between favoring your own country and a group endorsing prejudice against one specific country
It s totally prejudiced against America The US college system produces far more talented basketball players than the NBA can support and New Zealand unfairly discriminates against them by restricting their opportunities to find work in other leagues
You said the word imported does that mean only Americans
You re really cutting very fine hairs to hold onto your point here Protectionism isn t racism If it was racism Hydra and Violet wouldn t have made it to the quarter finals of Dreamhack a Dreamhack they were considered odds on favorites to take out between them and certainly wouldn t be sitting at 3 and 5 positions on the WCS circuit standings today Comparing it to racism is insulting to everyone involved It s insulting to the people who are just trying to negotiate the incredibly perilous ground between fostering the Korean scene and fostering the International scene and are now being compared to an infamously despicable period of cultural history and insulting to people who grew up not allowed to use the same park benches as white people because they were considered a lower class of humanity who are now having that compared to an eSports demarcation dispute Geographic isolationism and citizenship requirements are standard in sports organizations around the world Let s stick with talking about the direct implications this has on the Starcraft scene and not compare it to a fucking evil racist regime
I don t respect your point that the consequences aren t as bad so I insulted someone I understand the consequences aren t as bad but it s a minor form of prejudice If black guys weren t allowed to buy candy bars on Tuesdays it wouldn t be a big deal but I think we d all still be upset My point from the beginning was that there is a difference between isolationism and prejudice against one by a larger group If you can tell me about a sport that specifically disallows one country or race it would at least be the same situation
Racism is rooted in the concept of racial superiority It is to quote the handiest dictionary prejudice discrimination or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one s own race is superior or The belief that all members of each race possess characteristics abilities or qualities specific to that race especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races Anybody who says that Koreans are better at Starcraft because of racial superiority and not because they happened to be born in the country with the best infrastructure for encouraging developing and training RTS gamers is delusional Even if we did believe that Koreans were genetically superior gamers creating a non Korean competition would still be the opposite of racism Racism in that situation would be pushing non Koreans out of gaming because they re just not worthy of competing against the real gamers If you go to a major city in South Africa you ll still find buildings with elevators that only go up to the floors that black people were under apartheid allowed to visit Because black people were considered a second class of humanity That s racism Equating actual racism to a qualification system that isn t even racial it s purely geographical as the examples of Hydra and Violet demonstrate dilutes the meaning of racism in a particularly disturbing way If you say that any distinction between people on grounds of nationality is racism you give the actual racists the ones who believe that racial superiority makes them better than people of other colors a pleasant area of ambiguity to hide behind
Ahh I see where you re coming from You re not wrong but I don t think it s a huge issue It s close enough although I can totally see why people would disagree and not want to dilute the term I think it should be seen as imprecise shorthand and I think it s generally well understood people don t mean literally racism its hard to get people on the same terms for such a diffuse discussion Edit Although I have one quibble It doesn t have to be favoring the best to be racism there is no opposite of racism favoring a race because they re inferior would still be racism
It s the only country in the world with multiple Starcraft tournaments and ongoing leagues every year
Which may be a reason to be prejudiced for some
Blizzard can t support completely regional competition with an ecosystem for individual countries or areas not even the most popular esports titles do that However it s still obviously beneficial to anyone who wants to create an esport to give people all over the world opportunities to become pro gamers If that means locking out the region that already has the best infrastructure then they should do that
While I disagree with that I can understand people who think that it s best to keep out players that are too good Even for those people it seems like a trade off between fair treatment of all players and helping local players
I hate the WCS changes because it lessens the amount of top quality Starcraft and applauds the charity to lesser players It also discourages the strongest region for new talent in Starcraft But to call it racism is downright stupid Blizzard aren t banning Koreans because they re Korean They aren t banning Koreans for foreigners They re banning Koreans because they believe that is the best thing for the Sc2 viewer ship game interest and longevity of the game I disagree that we will see a benefit to sc2 for any of those things One of the most frustrating things is foreign players casters refusing to ever have any kind of debate about it and either attack the credibility of someone boiling it down to trolling or just insulting them Quite simply though THE most frustrating thing was implied idea that Dreamhack Leipzig was a big deal It wasn t PtitDrogo won a Dreamhack LAN Almost everyone would say that MarineLord s on line victory over Korea in Nation Wars was a bigger achievement than winning a LAN with a ton of mitigating circumstances in his favour Not only this but some of the advertisements of the worlds best Starcraft 2 players should just be illegal Leipzig s roster alone has no player who can even be considered a content for top 60 I don t know yet if the foreign scene will improve because of these changes There are two things that are certain the Korean scene will suffer the quality of play at these global events will suffer magnificently I would rather give up these personalities than these two things personally
imo there is really is no perfect solution if these changes weren t made then the sc2 foreigner scene would be pretty much dead and you would have no more foreign pro s just koreans and I think that would have been a pretty sad day However because of these changes the major events will no longer have any koreans which will effect the quality of the games we see Ultimately there is no right answer because of our small player base almost non existent sponsorship s and low view count Korean sc2 would not be hurting so badly if the game was popular but it s not over there hell broodwar a game made 18 years ago is still far more popular then sc2 Major changes to sc2 are needed and have been needed for a long time to get more people keen on the game Think about this also Blizzard is pretty much the only one pumping money into the tournaments now what happens when they no longer think it s financially viable thing to do
How can it be Racism if it doesn t apply to all Koreans MaSa is ethnically Korean but lived in Canada for like 10 years and surely they wouldn t have disqualified him from the qualifiers just because he was born in Korea right Oh right
Unfortunately though there is a degree of undeniable truth in this malignant racial stereotype Well I ll deny it I personally find Koreans more enjoyable to watch because I enjoy watching the highest level of play However many people enjoy watching the programers whose streams they have followed for years or whose analysis they have found interesting I seriously doubt that the cause of favoritism between Koreans and foreigners is based around racial lines because when we have had Koreans in the past who have gained a foreign following great example is Polt we have not seen this undeniable truth This article was overstated and sensationalist Jumping to racism is a REALLY big claim and it should not be taken lightly If it comes to light that there truly is business being done to actively discriminate against Koreans for no other reason than their nationality than we have a problem on our hands which must be addressed but I sincerely believe that it has more to do with personality and individual connection than racism
I honestly thought the change was because the growth of the other regions was stunted because the Korean power house would come and remove any chance of growth by absolutely destroying all hopefuls It doesn t really seem to have anything anything to do with race or stereotypes even though stereotypes do exist just a need for the rest of the world a chance to catch up to there skill level so one day we can all play and work together and it will be more equal opportunity
I didn t know Patraeus had the chops for this level of shitpost What a god
When the typical football fan cheers for his local club He isn t racist or hates other clubs He just wants to support his local club
But it s not that It s literally the world vs Korea
Thats called tribalism
And is that necessarily a bad thing to cheer for local clubs
The consequences in sports usually aren t a very big deal but yes the idea that you should support something because of where you were born or because some one looks like you is generally bad
Why is it bad Saying one supports local or region doesn t equate to being bigoted nor discriminatory against things outside And no one is saying they should have to support their local club that is a purely personal choice
Here is a short article on why tribalism is bad Like I said in sports it s not a huge deal but the same idea leads to a lot of the worst things that have happened in the world
It s erroneous to correlate support for your local culture customs and people with mindless violence and hatred There is nothing wrong with caring about the people around you and supporting them and their successes doesn t mean you implicitly have to denigrate people who aren t from where you are
If their success means some one else has to lose then your support would denigrate others If you support a foreigner to win you re implying you want a Korean to lose solely because of where they were born
You re suggesting that it s wrong for someone to win a game because that means someone else has to lose Conflict is where all of the excitement of competition comes from which includes rooting for those that you relate with whether that s because of cultural relation or because you connect with that person on an indefinable personal level The alternative would be rooting for people based purely on their skill level which is typically difficult to quantify and frankly soulless when stripped of any kind of cultural or emotional connection
That s not at all what I m saying I never said anything about the competitors doing anything wrong Tribalism is bad If you can t see why you should do some research on literally any major conflict in world history Edit Also I do watch starcraft to see to player s skill The fact that you feel the need to be culturally connected to the players is sad Why not just watch a sport that people from your country are good at
I had you already tacked as idiot once thanks for confirming it
My statement is not false
Quite a lot of response which is nice to see even if a lot of it is in disagreement I don t have time to respond to everything but I would like to address the issues that have been brought up surrounding the so called insensitive or distasteful use of a comparison to Apartheid in South Africa Given its intertwined history with NZ over a number of years I m well aware of the seriousness of Apartheid as a widespread human rights issue My family was heavily involved in the 1981 protests so I ve heard first hand testaments to this If you think the comparison is ill suited for its vague and indirect connection that s fine But to dismiss the use of a powerful metaphor for racism because an issue is not as atrocious and therefore deserving Talk about ignorant Far too many people share this archaic conservative sheltered view on unspeakable acts where they truly believe them to be unspeakable even when drawing attention to issues that literally caused their existence in the first place Get a grip and try to understand that merely referencing something as a basis for a more meaningful argument is not a slant at those who suffered for your humanity Thanks to everyone who read and shared this I hope to write more in the future
Honestly your comparison completely dismantles your argument It s hard to take someone seriously who truly believes that you can draw a very similar comparison between Apartheid and the current WCS format It s not only sensationalist but there also isn t much content in the article People find it insulting and insensitive because you are using it to further your argument in a way that really doesn t apply I would argue its actually more sheltered to use this comparison because I get the impression you don t understand the magnitude of your statement Regardless if you want to strengthen your writing you shouldn t rely on an extremely loose exaggeration but instead have much stronger content with more researched sources
Yes sensationalism is the word here And that part of Parting watching DH through a haze of bitter tears was the icing on the cake
But do you genuinely think this is actually Racism As in it is motivated by a hatred or dislike of ethnically Korean people It seems more based on Anglocentrism because of language barriers You still get to use an ism but do you really think Racism is the right one
The problem with your comparison is that it s illogical Excluding Koreans from WCS has nothing to do with race if so Illusion or Suppy wouldn t be eligible Koreans could have been black or white or as colorful as a bag full of Skittles and the argument to exclude them would have been the same And so not only is your article a bit sensationalist in its comparison to apartheid but it also relies on a flawed analogy to begin with
This isn t apartheid which was a bad choice as a comparison point but to argue this doesn t have anything to do with race Please They are like machines They are like a swarm This is the best decision for white peoples sic so that we can make more money win more tournaments https www youtube com watch v fwPYmyYlTSo And I realize that is from 2012 but those uncensored thoughts are representative and indicative of the intent behind this move I ve said this before but think of it this way what other professional league that represents the apex of its sport actively tries to prevent players of any kind from playing in their league Would the NBA MLB NFL The idea is self defeating you want to see the best For example the previously almost exclusively white MLB now has more players from Latin America than native born This was a game that was segregated explicitly until 1947 They dealt with this exact issue and instead of trying to create American winners so that more people could root on their hometown heroes the MLB embraced having the best product on the field And it should be noted those players speak English with the same general frequency proficiency as Koreans making the comparison even more apt I could go on with this all day did the NBA try to keep Yao Ming from playing in the US just because he couldn t speak any English Did the NBA try to stem the flood of players coming from overseas from Latin America and Europe Does the NFL try to prevent players from Australia Germany Tonga American Samoa etc from playing their sport No they actively embrace it because that is what professional sports do seek out the best to grow the sport It follows that this is not a true professional sport if we re creating national barriers to competition that sure look a lot like what someone would do if they were trying to make sure the winners at the highest level were white and we could get into how historically whiteness is a made up concept including many people today that would have been excluded 200 years ago but that s a bigger argument than this post I want to see the best play each other regardless of who they are where they are from or how opaquely interesting random people on reddit think the players are as personalities
You don t keep pitting NCAA Division I teams against Division III teams and just expect the Division III teams to magically get better and not get completely demotivated to play Division I has better practice facilities coaches training regimens etc etc As a Division III team gets better and starts to improve itself by overcoming the competition in its own tier it can finally start to move up the ranks and have a reasonable chance to improve and put itself in progressively better situations to help it succeed long term THAT is the real analogy that applies here The foreign scene has been getting absolutely stifled for the past two years at least The new WCS changes are attempt to stem the blood loss so to speak and give the scene a chance to stand on its own It has basically nothing to do with race and everything to do with the fact that the Korean SC2 machine is extremely well polished and at least a good decade ahead of everywhere else in the world training wise It just so happens that the tier of players that is above and beyond everyone else at an almost unfair level is entirely from Korea Just look at League and the LCS They have locked play based on region and it works out incredibly well for the game and its viewership and that s another game where Korea far outshines everyone else The WCS changes were NOT made in order to ban Koreans for whatever weird stupid racist motivations people keep trying to claim but because the foreign scene is basically Divison III NCAA while Korea is Division I Watching NCAA football basketball I can tell you those Division I vs Division II or III matchups are hilariously boring It s a stomp almost every time Now just imagine if that was what basically ALL the games were like and you might understand why a lot of people are in favor of this skill lock for SC2
This This is the proper analogy It has never had anything to do with race the wcs changes
Except that everyone including you is arguing that a true region lock whatever that is is going to make foreigners get better Separating Division I and Division III doesn t magically make D3 schools better When a player in D3 gets good enough they transfer to a D1 school If a foreigner is ever good enough to play in Korea again they will probably want to do the same thing and the foreign scene will not be elevated
Exactly I ve said this many times but the way to elevate the foreign scene is for Blizzard to full out fund multiple KESPA style teamhouses each with a full time KESPA coach who speaks passable English Coach Park comes to mind but other recently retired players would do this for the right amount of money Stipulate in the player contracts practice hours regulate the number of vacation days away from the house regulate their food exercise sleep and most importantly fire anyone immediately who refuses to live and practice like a KESPA pro You get two houses of 10 players each doing this for 2 3 years consistently and you will get KESPA level results from those players If you want foreigners to be as good as Koreans they need the drive work ethic and practice habits of Koreans There is no secret sauce to Starcraft or life Throwing money at bunch of amateurs isn t going to make them professionals
It also didnt help his argument when he kept on bringing up team sports Its works cause you bring in a few outside talent but you still have a couple of players from home Also those players that come from outside have to make the sacrafice of leaving their home countries to come and live in the us While there they intergrate into the teams hometown Its kind of like how foreign talent from eu and korea come to L A to play for the LCS and have to live there for 2 seasons a year Wcs in its current is not the absolute best position atm but I think we have to remind ourselves that sc2 is currently being kept up majorly by blizzard If the scene was as healthy as the people who wanted full competitive sc2 to be there would be events outside of blizzards control When you have events like iem and dreamhack wanting to pull out what else is blizzard suppose to do I say put your money where your mouth is and crowdfund your own ssl or gsl tournament where its only the best of the best players play at If dota2 can raise over a million dollars which isnt even adding the amount Valve took for itself sc2 can do the same right All these journalists and analysts are backseat drivers that want little to do with the actual driving and isnt willing to contribute any gas money
I like Korean players I like non Korean players and I root for them both I also understand after watching this game for many years that non Koreans simply cannot match top Koreans except on rare occasions There s nothing racist about it it s a simple fact Petraeus is conflating the underdog effect with some grand racist conspiracy concocted by an unnamed mass of Fans when really people are just looking at the data and realizing that the high level Korean scene just absolutely dominates the foreign scene If anything it s racist to privilege Koreans with the right to participate in tournaments halfway across the globe to the detriment of the local populations who struggle to even place in the Ro16 Yet Petraeus evokes some vague westernized view a ghost of white guilt hence the hamfisted reference to South Africa which is now a total hellhole as a strawman against the idea of region lock And calls an entire community racist for trying to create opportunities for a group that has been marginalized for years
I like the intent of the idea so there s more diversity in WCS even if the rule itself is silly and should be modified to be something better but the idea isn t to directly harm Koreans Comparing apartheid is offensive to talented rugby players in the apartheid regime and in New Zealand at the time It should be changed to be more inclusive but I do believe some rule where they are more foreigner heavy can only be a good thing for competition It s not fun seeing players stomp other players over and over and Koreans vs Foreigners sort of is GSL is a level playing field WCS is a level playing field I want it to remain that way
affirmative action rather than racism would have been better comparison
Not a bad article but I don t think it s even remotely close to Apartheid The fact is having one group of people who wins every tournament in every region all the time is discouraging growth in other groups Why even try to be a competitor if you aren t from that group That these people hail from a particular country is irrelevant in and of itself though I suspect that it took so long to make this change because they were concerned it might be appear to be racist There are advantages had in the Korean scene that simply don t exist anywhere else at the moment and those advantages translate to on average overall better players at the pro level Locking down regions will eventually allow other regions to potentially flourish It s unlikely that there will ever be an equivalent infrastructure for pro gaming anywhere outside of what is currently in Korea at least for the foreseeable future but a healthy competitive scene needs to have realistically attainable goals Being the best in insert region should not just mean that you got the honor of falling in the round of 16 at an event in your home region to someone who flew in from somewhere else for easier competition You should have won there even if you can t anywhere else As someone else said here this is closer to Affirmative Action Sheltered competition and welfare spots at the global finals to people from other regions who will most likely lose handily but they still get to be there and compete If it were truly Apartheid it would be that Koreans would be excluded entirely from competition that any SC2 event held featuring Koreans would be officially blacklisted and Blizzard would probably have some kind of testing to ensure that any competitors at an event were not Korean enough to play That said I do dislike the term faceless Korean which gets thrown around here rather carelessly and frequently The players from Korea are just as human as anyone else given to hopes dreams idiosyncratic behaviors etc That s not systemic racism like Apartheid but your ordinary individual racism about which we have little or no control
Much respect to a guy who has put in more hours then virtually anyone If anyone thinks punishing kespa players for being better because they have a better system of practice is fair or good idk what to say This won t help non Korean players get better just delay the sad truth that they will 95 be crushed at blizzcon Make an American or European kespa and we might see actual improvement
Tell me which sport doesn t have a local or national or regional level of competition blocked off for all those who are not within that geographical restriction His comparison with SA rugby is different most countries boycotted them on the international stage but they could still play internally
I m from Australia and I can t play in eu events Wow they must be so racist There no money in this little scene so why can t I go destroy eu s ecosystem so racist
Patraeus thank you
We don t care about the colour of your skin the country you come from or much else What we really care about is what language you speak and whether you acknowledge foreign fans on a regular basis The comparison is inherently flawed The options for this year were Same as 2015 but no WCS league for foreigners What we have now In the first option all money for foreigners disappears which leads to the very sudden demise of the foreign scene No foreign scene means no DHs no IEMs no Gfinity etc Competition would only happen at pro levels in Korea like the BW scene That would kill sc2 as an esport stone dead People like KT Violet the only BW Korean who really interacted with foreign fans Parting Polt MC and MMA are rare That s why sc2 will never survive on just a Korean scene
daaaamn Pet killed it
Where is the article I only found like the introduction
I wrote my response here a criticism of the article http www twitlonger com show n 1so7u6l new post true
First of all this is a well written and thought out post and I agree with a lot of what HuK says Regional scenes are important and I loved the interviews we got with the local heroes especially HuK uthermal and Bly I think we ll see great stories and higher level games between foreigners than ever this year But I think there are a few assumptions that HuK and others that are very happy with the new system make which need to be adressed First of all most people are well aware that Korea gets more money than before and the number of games in Korea is down not up even if the seasons are more drawn out Now to the biggest point many or most people that voiced concerns these days are actually part of group 3 Group 3 Happy with the changes to the foreign scene understand that the region lock is needed and good for the game no longer wanted to see Hyun and Co farm those events anyway But unhappy with the changes to the korean scene and concerned with the lack of new players in the land of StarCraft So as I said this group is fine or even happy with the changes to the foreign scene but considers this game a global sport and can t just block out the situation in Korea Yes it is true that they get more money than before and the prize money for a low finish is also bigger now But the problem is that all that money is in 4 events 2 are already running so there are only 2 more qualifiers left for Korean players to participate in for the whole year If a player didn t qualify for SSL lost in code A or the GSL qualifier and is not in a Proleague team then he has a huge problem As it stands right now he doesn t have anything big to play in for half a year This player quite frankly is fucked And yes we will see sOs in Proleague and the guy made enough money anyway but Proleauge players are not the ones we worry about We worry about the Code B level and unknown players that are needed since we need fresh blood in Korea For those players there is no incentive to play and that s a problem If a foreigner fails in the DH qualifer he can play the IEM qualifer a month later A korean non proleague player has to wait 6 months instead That s what it comes down to and that s what makes us wonder if we will see a new Life Maru with a system like this That s all what stuchiu s article was saying and I think we should all worry about it even if we are happy with the changes to the foreign scene If Korea had gotten 1 more GSL SSL instead of less and had 8 qualifers instead of 4 this year the situation would already look way better same amount of money just spread out over 8 instead of 4 events Thankfully Canata and GSL are working hard to solve the problem but since it s all part of WCS I wished Blizzard had done something to help Apart from the extra money which will just go to the Lifes Innos Zests that already make enough money anyway they just took events aways from the Korean scene without giving them any in return Tl dr We group 3 are happy for the foreign scene but can t just pretend that Korea is fine We would ve wished that both scenes would be in a better situation this year and not just one Korea needs more tournaments 4 qualifiers a year is not enough Non proleague code B level players in Korea are fucked I m still excited for this year and hope there are a lot of KeSPA cups and some global events in the making which would already make me sleep a lot better Edit added tl dr
Amen My suggestion would be to rebuild the Code A tournament and then go from there So right now Code A doesn t actually exist It s just a qualification match for Code S There used to be a real tournament Code A August 2011 where the winners would get a seed in the next Code S I d like to see that return So for example everyone who loses in the Code S qualification match can automatically participate in the Code A tournament In addition to that we would have a seperate Code A qualification tournament that seeds you directly into Code A 16 32 more players who didn t compete for a Code S spot or maybe the players who came third in the qualifiers And give it a reasonable prize pool so that players get payed Imo this could even just be an online format to save production costs TL DR I d like to see Code A come back
GSL Preseason felt like an old school Code A
deleted
I don t think we should have just the preseasons The way Code A worked was that players who did not qualify for Code S had a chance to compete A preseason includes Code S players aswell who would just always win it So I wouldn t object to it as an addition to Code A but I don t think it s a good substitute edit spelling
I think the code B level koreans that make code A ssl first round are super happy this year getting 2 4k 2x a year is more than they used to make but the Korean qualifiers are brutal Many good players might just lose 1 bo3 5 and be out for so long Money is good but there needs to be more opportunities
Thanks for replying to my post with some thoughts Obviously I m more than open to discussing this and I feel like there are great points on both sides of the discussion I m at the airport still traveling back from Germany so please be patient with my writing So first of all great points A lot of them though are not only Korea problems which seems to be the common trend The fact is that Starcraft isn t the biggest Esport anymore and if you are a tier 3 player whether foreign or Korean chances are you won t achieve much in sc2 despite the number of qualifiers or not The spacing for events this year is gappy for sure In the foreign scene if you fail these IEM qualifiers coming up you basically have no event into DH sometime in May not even having pro league So yes I agree the spacing is bed but Koreans also are getting the majority of invites to events like IEM Taipei which of course will be all the stars Which is always been the way it is The fact is that esports and especially SC2 is a dog eat dog world It s a one on one game where you don t rely on teammates and only rely on yourself and your own skills If you are good enough you can qualify and compete and if you can t then you are doomed There is no coddling like or not a lot of support for lower tiers like there is team games such as LoL and CSGO As someone who has competed in Korea GSL and pro league it is very stressful to have so many things over lapping I personally would prefer the foreign scene was fewer events with higher prize pool Practicing for pro league is intense especially if teams do ranking matches internally to decide who plays Having pro league as well as random events such as IEM Taipei online events as well as SSL and or GSL can be utterly exhausting The fact is there will never be the ideal situation as far scheduling or events unless blizzard decided to just dump a lot more money into the scene they already dump a lot So yes there should be more support for up and coming players for both scenes but the fact is there never was and never will be This is a 1v1 game where the majority of practice happens on ladder anyways You either make it or you don t and that s life If you really want to grind then I suggest playing on the numerous online cups offered Ting being a great one coming up open to Koreans Scheduling is never perfect I would prefer bigger and fewer events for the foreign scene as someone who will most likely try to attend two dream hacks in two weeks later in the year but at the same time if I fail IEM Katowice qualifier I have nothing to play in until May sometime Thank you for your post once again though
This so much
literally this gj musicus
If the changes in WCS work out that could bring new blood in the West there has been new players every year as far as Korea is concerned it s harder the game ain t really that popular there so why artificially create a big scene where there is no such thing
I fail to see what s artificial in allowing players to qualify for tournaments more often than every six months
That s how Korea chose to organize themselves this year Nobody asked them to They could have made tournaments smaller or made them be 3 months each but they decided to do them simultaneously and every 6 months
Nope
They did
What happened was Blizzard realized that they can make less money look like more money by making the prize pools for GSL and SSL larger and then making them occur half as often
Brood War had like 2 OSLs a year because Korean likes it that way
Nope three OSLs and three MSLs Count them
It s actually 2 7 OSLs and 2 85 MSLs You rounded up and I rounded down
If they liked it that way why did GSL do 5 or 6 per year until Blizzard made them stop
Why would Blizzard make them lower the amount of tournaments from 3 3 of GSL SSL to 2 2 The rumors suggest that it was the Korean partners that wanted to lower the amount possibly because Riot wanted to split up broadcasting rights in Korea rather than OGN doing it all This was of course back in the end of 2015 and I m not sure how it all ended up but the 2016 plans for SC2 had to be settled early of course probably befofe Riots plans were finalized
I think the main reason for artificially creating a bigger scene than what would be there naturally is the basis that is already there We have a Kespa infrastructure and teams sponsors invested in a scene that at least until this year have been able to support competition like Proleague If the scene gets downsized to natural levels that entire system might collapse meaning there will be no Proleague not enough teams and at worst it could end up with all the big esports teams pulling out of SC2 What would be left Battlenet clans that have next to no sponsorship perhaps but no more infrastructure like teamhouses and perhaps no broadcasting partners would find justification to put on leagues anymore
There is also a group who only dislike the WCS changes because of the reduction in Korean events and thus agree wholeheartedly with the issue raised by stiuchiu less new blood Excluding the players who switched over from KeSPA there have been fewer Korean pros entering the scene This isn t solely attributed to the changes in WCS however fewer opportunities for no name Koreans to make a name for themselves reduces the appeal of becoming an SC2 pro This in itself shows that the current scene is unsustainable in the long term Other than achieving high ranks on Korean ladder OlimoLeague and GSL SSL qualifiers somewhat ladder related I think I m not sure what else is easily accessible for up and coming players Again this isn t necessarily Blizzard s problem to solve but something the Korean scene needs to address
There has been less new blood in Korea for quite some time actually it hasn t started this year
For sure didn t mean to imply that
I m on my phone traveling to please bare with me There being less new blood is a global problem IMO it just seems less dramatic in the foreign scene since players are more easily identifiable because of things outside of their play and results Someone in another post in this thread also cited that if a pro doesn t do well in SSL or GSL they miss half the year besides pro league That is the same for foreigners now Miss IEM qualifier and next event is DH Austin sometime in May The fact is that most people who think Korean problems are only their own are actually global problems or exaggerated and not problems at all
I agree it s a global problem but the situation in Korea got worse compared to last year while in the foreign scene it got better compared to last year which I m happy about The goal should be to make it better for both In the WCS circuit there are how many qualifiers left this year Ten at least There are two left for WCS Korea maybe four if two KeSPA cups with open qualifers happen The timeframe between the GSL S1 and S2 qualifiers is way bigger than the timeframe between a DH and IEM qualifer I don t want to take anything away from the foreign scene I m happy for them but the Korean scene needs more events
This is more of a Korean problem though Korea can t support more events or they would be hosting their own tournaments GSL and SSL went from 3 to 2 because there isn t enough popularity for more SC2 in Korea If the fans and the money for these tournaments come from primarily foreigners now we shouldn t be propping up Korea so they can have 60 pros while NA can t even support 6
Agree with this completely Definitely seemed to be your target audience A lot of people have a lot of misconceptions about this system and have started getting crazy made when we re only 1 month in Definitely didn t help that the tweet directing to the article was bullshit which is what pissed most people off
You just compared 3 4 events depending on whether you want to include HomeStory cup or not over 5 6 months foreign to 2 events over 6 months Korean Over a full year that s paced to 7 8 foreign events and 4 Korean events And actually the real difference is even greater It s fair to say people would be a lot happier with only twice as many Korean included events
I read that Canata runs an amateur league in Korea too jsyk
I think I heard that on a cast once Am excited to see what other solutions GSL Canata and kenzi come up with https twitter com kenzi131 status 691339964089389056 Hopefully these get broadcast
Yeah Next year they should plan out the scene with a more staggered 6 league system Blizzcon and work outwards from there Anything else is a disservice
Good write up I agree and am excited for the future

I agree with Huk the incentive for foreigners to do their absolute best and train for every single event is higher than ever When foreigners meet foreigners in upcoming tournaments it will be a brutal bloodbath of a match likely to be close great matches each person craving the trophy cause they know it is realistic Storylines will be built rivalries will develop At the end of the year we get to have that hope against all odds that a foreigner can take their shot at the ultimate prize at Blizzcon I love this system seems healthy and positive for viewing at the same time
Wow this is comprehensive and well thought out
I don t get when eSports took this nationalistic turn The beauty of online gaming to me has always been the power of the internet to bridge language cultural gaps and allow players from across the world to compete to be the best While ping across regions etc can be a problem in general online gaming is a pure meritocracy based on player skill Personally I don t care what country a player is from and honestly if I never even saw what the players look like it wouldn t bother me at all I m far more interested in the skill and style they bring to the virtual arena I wonder if all the marketing fluff human interest stories we receive in the West which are intended to make sports marketable to a wider audience has conditioned us to look for the same in eSports It s a real shame to see the quality of the competition so drastically reduced Comparing the recent DreamHack to e g the recent TY vs Patience matches the quality of DH play wasn t even remotely close When you artificially take the meritocratic element of most skilled players competing and winning the entire raison d etre of a competition goes away I look forward to the day when online play advances to the point that players across the world can compete without any significant advantage in either direction due to connection speed Then hopefully we ll see this weird anachronistic application of nationalism to a global arena go away
I love this Keep it up HuK
Well spoken
I think the best point to make is foreigners are more motivated to get better than they ever did and are practicing harder and getting better at the game This motivation is gonna come a long way when they got a lot better than they are now and provide us with even better games possibly rivaling the skill and precision that we grace Koreans to have
Might also encourage more western teams to reconsider picking up sc2 talent I remember CLG was close to getting some players but backed off when blizzard didnt region lock wcs
Not really a few days ago even CLG said that they are not looking into SC2 anymore they are looking into other games but not SC2
If it would work like that then Taiwan and Germany would be second to Korea only as well as China because they ve had this isolated scene for a long while and nothing came of it China is a pretty good SC2 country but per capita not better than say Sweden or France
We don t know anything about their practice habits or the true competitiveness of that scene It also is no where near as popular there as it elsewhere relatively speaking The isolated scene argument is just wrong if you look at Korea In Brood War they were an isolated scene By that logic since there is no one better to play against their skill level will never improve The Foreign scene is larger and much more competitive than China so players will improve
Good points good work
And you still have that in GSL Or maybe you think Dreamhack Valencia 2015 was the best of the best and we need more 3 0 s by Curious over TRUE in the finals
Or how about that one dreamhack were Teaja just showed up and won it all without losing a map such hype there was for that one
I agree with this but I think with the new system you are still going to see best player vs best player in the final and both can be Korean I just think foreigners have more opportunities in the brackets group play And it does make it easier for someone like HuK to make the finals We just want to see best player vs best player and would be great is a foreigner was actually the best Because even Drogo saying i m the best really doesn t hold weight if you exclude the best
He also said that today he is the best and tomorrow it s back to the grind to prove himself again That mindset and drive is what I think was sorely missing in the Foreign scene When it was all Koreans getting actual stage time was a rare dream and when it did happen and the stakes were up players just went Full Foreigner and fell apart
That s not everything about it Drogo won last Dreamhack Some of us know him from back in the days when he was asking advices in the Ogaming forum and made post after getting to diamond and to master He used to stream for the french scene and is overall a fun dude It s easier to cheer for someone you know someone you can talk to on Twitter or else And then again it depends on what you re looking for I love to watch really high quality SC2 I watch almost all korean high level games Proleague GSL SSL and a bit of Olimoleague But I also like this games because of the story telling CJ herO vs CJ ByuL the carries of their team facing each other ByuL struggling to get the first place a struggling Flash all killing for a place in Proleague Grand Finale and so on And it s the same with the foreigner scene These are different pleasures all in the same game In football talking about soccer here if you want to watch the best playing you watch the top three european national leagues In basketball you watch NBA And so on But the worldcups are something else You get to watch a team you can relate to a team you know because you see these players in your national league maybe you went to high school with one of the players things like that It doesn t matter if Canada wins the Hockey cup every time It doesn t matter if the US win the basketball cup every time It doesn t matter if Blizzcon isn t only consisting of the best players You want to watch the best players Go watch GSL SSL and Proleague they re here and it s all year long Since it s a year long qualifier BlizzCon doesn t have the highest level They have the players who had the highest peaks in a year not at a given time So if it has to be a huge event with high level but not the absolute best and a good storytelling I prefer this new system Wether Koreans have enough tournaments is another matter and a valid one though
But his Dreamhack win means nothing when you don t allow the highest level of competitors to be eligible for the tournament Remember Jinro and Stephano What made them so magical is that they were able to go against the best and STILL pull out a win It is quite sad that people lay down and say Well they are just to dominate lets exclude them to make things more interesting Whats the point of competition Whats the point of striving to become a better player How about we give everybody who participates a trophy hot coco and a pat on the back
Its a bit like with those kids competitions nowadays where everyone gets a trophy regardless of performance The times we live in
You don t let the players improve when they have no chance to win Remember these MLG brackets with only NaNiWa or Stephano breaking a foreign flag in a sea of koreans Yeah it was good But players like Demuslim or Feast or ToD had no way in hell to break into an interesting paid place Now it is The competition is closer so each improvment is going to be worth training for His Dreamhack win still means a lot It means he has beaten the best the Foreign land has to offer Not every map not every competition is about the very best winning What s the point of French League 2 What s the point of a national italien rugby team and rugby league if New Zealand is going to win it in the end It just means something different It s not like the top korean can t compete anymore
I m not sure that the comparaison with old sports are really appropriate Soccer for example was a symbol of patriotism for people a way to unite them in an area or a country against others It was important for french to beat german Like it was important for American to beat Russians at Olympic games during the cold war But it was built like this 50 100 years ago Come on we are more evolved educated opened to other cultures We are reading and talking with people living all around the world everyday We should be able to just have the same connection with a german than with a korean Because it is what we are talking about Yes this is great to see someone progress in your area but what about a young American living in the west coast He is not closer to you than a korean He has a lot of social values that differs to yours but you should think he is closer to you than a korean To be honest I would have been happier if they did not have touched the DH IEM and just put region lock on the WCS premier League Now I have 5 events to be hyped for in a whole year that s sad
The problem still is that a competitive scene isn t totally apart of the rest of the game itself If foreigners don t do anything in tournaments then the more competitive ones stop playing It means it becomes quite unreachable for the rest of the population who starts to think it s a game for koreans And before you know it you have no more players on the european or korean scenes because there s just no emulation There s a reason why we call the non korean scene the foreign scene We re all behind the foreigners because they represent us against the very best It s not us vs them It s all of us chinese european american hell even african players versus the Koreans Again DreamHack wasn t the very best level It was a tournament with well known Koreans MMA MC Jaedong and such some of the very best and a few foreigners It was well below de level of GSL People don t want to watch the best games they want to watch good players more And that s understandable But I consider that you can have good games even when the players make mistakes because it s the fact that they re on an equal footing that makes it so exciting Sorry if my grammar is full of mistakes I m not a native english speaker
I meant A sea of korean flags I don t know if I just poorly expressed myself because it s not my native tongue or if you just overreacted But it s strange that you seem to find racism when there s none because you aren t able to understand my argument without the pirsm of racism of white pride or idk what bullshit you can invent
And why does it matter that they re korean
I don t plan in repeting myself a thousand times so I ll just do it once You don t have the same contact with everyone around the world One of the biggest reason is not everyone speaks english As I said PtitDrogo is also loved and supported in France because he was there with the community asked advices years ago on a french forum gave advices streamed in french He was there for the small LANs That s why these guys have more national support Because people know them There s a reason why this myth of the faceless korean still exists because people don t know them as well You re not a fan only for playstyles reason Because you just support the best It s not that easy and it s not that reasonable Or else you would stop supporting a player because he s in a slump You support a player for a variety of reasons and not any of these is better than the others It s just personnal As for the Koreans vs foreigners it s a matter of classification A foreigner is almost always the underdogs people often root for the underdogs I don t see anything strange here
I agree with you However I think the point is overall to get foreigners better at Starcraft Honestly it s boring seeing Koreans win at SC2 all the time Foreigners give us hope for change
Why it is boring My favorite players are all Koreans and terran MMA MVP Innovation I m totally biased for the race I play and I m feeling much closer of Inno MMA and those guys than assholes like Idra Naniwa Avilo that the foreigner crowd always cheered for There always had something wrong with SC2 viewers preferring trashtalk instead of pure skill even for foreign players
TIL the foreigner crowed cheers for Avilo
I ll never cheer for Avilo
I usually cheer for him to lose Does that count
That s good with me man
I don t know I don t like seeing the same people win in the super bowl every year or in the world cup or in the NBA finals Maybe it s the underdog mentality I like people like Showtime State Mcanning As you can see I am a Tosser Nevertheless I like some Korean Protoss plays as well I would just rather see the underdogs win
You re looking for some parity and thats exactly what any sport needs Thats the reason the NFL put in the salary cap It creates parity so you have better closer competition
And region lock is somewhat like a salary cap Now everyone has a chance
I would argue that this analogy is very off though The salary cap from what I know is made to make all the teams have a equal chance to participate it does not lock out the top 10 teams from competing
I guess I m not familiar enough with the region lock How does is lock out Koreans from competing
Koreans cant compete in any wcs event more or less all bigger tournaments outside korea To me that is nothing like a salary cap Rather the opposite if anything since it negates the ability to participate and win based on their skill The koreans who did not qualify for GSL and SSL now have no tournament to play for 5 6 months simply because they are korean not because they lack the skill
I think it s a western thing over a Korean mindset We want to be entertained We appreciate skill but a personality and decent skill goes much farther than little to no personality showing and incredible skill If they were all trashtalk and completely sucked then that person would be a laughing stalk
That s really fucking racist What about MC Parting etc I think you forget that Koreans are humans as well not a goddamn faceless blob Shame on you
What You re overreacting I like Koreans and I like seeing them win But I don t like seeing them win all the time And you missed my post talking about other players I like watching Get over yourself man This isn t racism I like underdogs I like Koreans The foreigners are the underdogs I like seeing Koreans win sometimes But it s just like ANY OTHER SPORT I don t like seeing the same people win all the time Geez man relax It s just a game EDIT You missed the point where I agreed with you I want to see foreigners get better That s all I m saying man
You re creating an us vs them rhetoric that simply isn t there Why are all Koreans lumped together They re not on the same team They don t play a certain race They are different people How many times do I have to say that Literally the only unifying feature is that they re Korean No the foreigners are not the underdogs individual players or teams are Life was an underdog at WCS at Blizzcon But Koreans are not a faceless blob Root for individual teams or individual players I like a good underdog as well I like Serral and when he was up against Innovation in nationwars I was like HOLY SHIT HE S GONNA DO IT HE S GONNA KILL OFF KOREA And no it s not a game struggling against stereotypes and generalizations what every minority has to do It sucks and I really fucking hate that I have to do this I don t want to be doing this any more than you There is nobody more than me that wishes that I didn t have to rant about this Ok and as to your foreigner comment why do you want them to get better Why does it matter where they live Is there something special about Koreans where you can t emphasize with them I m not Korean I don t speak Korean I still manage just fine
Granted you have a point with the us vs them mentality but my intention was not so Regardless have a nice day sir I find this whole situation to be pointless
Ok walk away when your hidden biases are shown
Great write up You are on point
Well said
Another thing we are all forgetting is that the quality of WCS games without Koreans is actually way higher Like in prior years we all knew the top 4 or 8 or whatever of a tournament It d be MC Hyun Hydra herO or whatever So we would have Korean high level semis or finals maybe 2 3 good games Prior to this there was a ton of 3 0 sweeps as MC destroyed foreigners This dreamhack even if the games were high level in terms of perfect play they were so close and scrappy they were way better to watch So many super close games even the 3 0 felt less one sided Evenly matches games provide high level games too
Nice writeup Huk I can really feel the argument that foreign players as a whole improve the most if there is money within their grasp and not Korean players improve ladder to only help a very few Maybe that were the case with healthy competitive scene but not now especially NA Imo
Reading this actually makes me sad and wish really hard that Koreans step up their game even more and do to foreigners what Life did to Lilbow last year but 50 times worse almost as if they re taking a huge cock up in their asses hurting their soul D
the skill legitimacy armada is fighting back D

I worry as to whether the foreign scene will be sustainable in the long run Whilst prize money has gone up and there s a more genuine chance of winning some for foreigners it s also become a lot more top heavy The money at challenger level has all but disappeared Players who aren t top 16 20 foreigners will have a bit of difficulty in the long run I think I m still hoping that this is a stepping stone for a proper league again with MLG infrastructure because I can t see this system being workable long term because there won t be a lot of growth in the foreign scene either
There s lots and lots of online tournaments that go on almost everyday If you check out teamliquid s upcoming events tab sc2online you ll see they have numerous tournaments and I m pretty sure there s more out there If the game grows again we might see more tournaments again which non top players can participate in
The online tournaments aren t really a proper source of income though 100 prize pools don t sustain a scene or help players become pros Prize pools in the foreign scene have gone up but they ve become much more top heavy which will cause problems in the long run unless something major happens which is what I said I want Motivation is a very ephemeral thing once players have 6 months of events where they make 0 and have to pay a lot more than that to get there then I ll not be shocked if they decide to pack it in entirely leading to shrinkage
100 isn t a lot but having a lot of those small tournaments adds up We can t really tell though how next year is going to be but it s always been noteworthy that change always happens maybe next year won t be as top heavy maybe not But as for right now this system is great to motivate lots of foreigners to play better than they ever did
The reason I think the scene is in a good place even with relatively top heavy prize pools is because the skill levels aren t so disparate between the top foreigners and the lower level foreigners We have to have a distinction where we give out the money because we can t give 1000 bucks to a player for making the RO32 or RO64 Ideally those challenger tier players will look at the bracket and believe they can make a deep run and practice hard and do it because it is much more possible than ever
The simple fact is SC2 is not a popular in Korea as Broodwar was in its heyday Blizzard is doing what they can to prop up the game and the two major tournaments But they can t make Korea love SC2 like they love LOL Personally I like story lines but I like the best games Dreamhack finals were poorer in game quality than many of the low round Korean tournament games This is a bit of a problem but hopefully it can improve Maybe the new system will help but so far the best foreigners have spent some time playing in Korea and quickly lost their luster after leaving So maybe foreigners can bootstrap themselves to glory with the hope of prizes and wins but probably not So there is no perfect solution The game is not popular enough and foreigners have shown in 6 years they cannot compete
Guys you are writing to much things
Wait so sOs won t be in ANY GSLs this year Fucking serious
It s very simple the Strongest players should be allowed to compete where ever and whenever Just like players in the international basketball scene many have made it over to the NBA from other countries and have had success and vice versa The changes to the WCS system is a step back in the direction of which esports should be heading
what high level koreans were at dreamhack
Hydra who made RO8 at Blizzcon And arguably had a very good shot at winning against Rogue and Violet who went 13 0 in the tournament till the RO4
Hydra is not high level wtf Violet isn t either
Violet isn t but Hydra certainly is He s ro4 Blizzcon material
He may have been at the end of HotS although that s debatable but in LotV he s been mostly awful so far and calling him a high level Korean just isn t true right now
The Korean leagues are going they ve been for a while Online tournaments have been happening DH Winter happened We already have players that we can say are high level Solar is a high level Korean Zerg for example Hydra was very good for most of 2015 though I wouldn t ever call him Ro4 Blizzcon material but he s been average in LotV so far And that s average compared to the other players who were at Dreamhack Not even to other Koreans
We ve seen Hydra play all of what once Not enough to say how good he really is at LoTV especially given how developing the meta is and how many ZvZs he had to play in a row Hydra played 1 ZvT and 4 ZvZs Not enough to gauge his overall level of performance really The Korean leagues are throwing us lots of upsets where strongly favoured players are playing like retards because they think they are unbeatable So we can t accurately say who is the top player anymore You could have a tourney with Inno sOs and soO yet still not have a top level Korean by your standards then Because they ve all been very mediocre I d go as far as saying bad in LoTV so far Olimoleagues are online and pretty much only have lower level Terrans and Zergs in them Online performance is very different to in booth performance
Hydra played at NationWars and at Dreamhack plus he played in some Go4SC2 cups where he s been doing terribly His winrate in matches in LotV is 56 against non Koreans In HotS that winrate was almost 90 And I don t think any of the players he played against made unbelievable progress as players that Hydra couldn t have matched if he practiced enough Hence he s been average compared to other players at Dreamhack Yes we re being thrown curve balls but we can still look at the picture and say These are the good players RIGHT NOW E g Solar This picture is going to change over time obviously but as of right now the three you mentioned aren t the top of the Korean scene soO even said himself he s been the worst player on SKT in in house practice for a while now Olimoleagues are online and pretty much only have lower level Terrans and Zergs in them Many of the players who ve been playing in Olimoleague in LotV have also done well in the Korean leagues aLive MyuNgSiK Soulkey Solar Patience ByuN all play ed in both offline leagues Most of the others are at least in Code A Sure it s different than in booth competition but it s not meaningless either
no he s not Hydra loses to every foreign trash out there He only beat Dream because that guy was on the biggest tilt I ve seen
You just dont get it m8 only the very best of the very best koreans can win against foreign legends like Elazer Namshar Sortof or even take 2 maps against the god that is Bly
Get that stick out of your ass how is someone who s been RO8 Blizzcon not high level There s more good players than the guys winning SSL GSL Proleague
Lol one lucky weekend doesn t make a good player He s not a top tier Korean There s no two ways about that
Except he had to have a lot of lucky weekends to make it to Blizzcon ion the first place I wonder why the koreans you consider high level didn t have enough lucky weekends to even make it that far I m sorry mate but you re an elitist idiot representing one of the most uncharming qualities of the sc2 community
Lol he beat foreign scrubs to get there
Yeah and he beat Dream in the RO16 but whatever You re a moron
Stick to name calling as you have no worthy argument He beat 1 good player does not make him top tier
All in all he s 100 high level Since you re immune to arguments and I don t feel like wasting my time with some random sc2 elitist I ll stick to namecalling indeed
I think the majority of people who watch sc2 will disagree with you there my man
Well they didn t watch PL or GSL He was Code S once I think
Which one actually lost 2 games to some guy named Namshar lol I think it was violet but wow what a top tier korean lol
Sadly the average reddit hero isn t capable of reading texts that long so even though there s a couple of nice points made the omfg koreanzzzz cowboys won t hear any of it
Huk s opinion is inherently biased since his only chance of even being an even somewhat competitive player is to have a hard region lock He won t be competitive regardless though that s besides the point Not surprised he likes league
Because HuK has never been a top foreigner competing against the top koreans
Those days are long over for Huk which is why he s biased
agreed even in those days the koreans werte still doing a hard transition from BW now that game has really shut its doors they ahve all gone hard sc2 and all the foreigners have had to fix a league so they can stay somewhat relevant
he was and then he started complaining about how much he had to practice
removed
Lol Here comes this argument again You know that Zerg and Protoss are the best races right now right In fact I would say Zerg is better off than Protoss
okay but this still wont make me watch white championship series
To me regional locking means only one region can play in the tournament Why should Americans be let to play in Dreamhack when its a european tourny To let all countries but one play in a tourny is just racist
deleted
Maybe you already know the answer to that question 3rd attempt from you
This guy has to be retarded Do you know his nick want to tag him
Kaserati
thx
I agree with the points Huk made I also agree with the system change and think it s a great opportunity and very healthy for the foreign scene Nearly every sport has tournaments that exclude top players But he doesn t adress a problem I have Many of you will disagree with me here but as a Terran player I m biased I like watching Terrans play It s not necessary about winning or loosing but that are simply the games I m most interested in I think that is understandable Ofc I watch the other games but I don t know if I have kept watching DH if uThermal has been eliminated in the RO16 Yeah he made it through but we couldn t saw a single TvZ nor TvT in the playoffs I can t even remember if a TvT was broadcastet That s 1 3 of all possible matchups missing Overall foreign Terrans doesn t perform as well as foreign Zerg or Protoss just look at the WCS rankings over the past years and I simply fear about my enjoyment watching those tournaments We will see what will happen but that s the part I m still sceptical I simply wish koreans had more tournaments
The thing is we ve never had true region locking for wcs the half hearted attempts in previous years was worse than having no system in place at all
The funny thing about WoL was that for most of it Korea was split between BroodWar and SC2 It wasn t till they fully swapped over that Korea began it s complete and utter domination of everyone

its ok champ I know large blocks of text scare you but you can do it when you re done I promise we can talk about the content maybe I ll walk you through the parts you had difficulties with
Definitely more relevant than a random sc2 elitist hater
deleted
Did you seriously delete your previous post just to say this again He is providing points on why this WCS changes are good contrary to what naysayers may say While he might not have all the facts right there is a lot of truth to what he says He is in a position in the scene that has enough draw to be heard my lots of people if any random reddit poster like myself said the exact same thing he did a lot of people would disregard the post But since HuK is still in the scene it s never a surprise people will read listen to what he has to say
Ure 2nd attempt
is this where we post everything twice ok here I go again its ok champ I know large blocks of text scare you but you can do it when you re done I promise we can talk about the content maybe I ll walk you through the parts you had difficulties with
Love HuK but him saying the new format is better is like McDonald s telling me their salads are healthy It s a massive conflict of interest
Replace Koreans with male players and foreigner with female players and understand the kind of charity Huk is begging for lmao
Not drama Downvoted 10
tl dr HuK is a joke
Watch out reverse uptlo comming your way Go troll somewhere else huk is right
HuK is a joke what important is what viewers want and I want more koreans or top end foreigners fight against koreans not foreigners killing each other back off noob
You are one viewer You cant be seriously trying to speak for the all of the SC2 viewers
Yet viewer numbers are 30 up on 2015 events maybe what you want isn t what the majority wants Deal with it
Or maybe they re 30 up because new expansion Use your brain
Maybe they are But it still means that people haven t stopped watching because there are no Koreans
No it s not See what carmac says what Nathanias says what the pros say and what Blizzard does See the Numbers of Dreamhack Leibzig Listen to the people who DO KNOW shit instead of making false claims Look into the video of carmac that was just posted it is really really really insightful and completely on point right
If you think a new and improved expansion just came out and perhaps that s the reason behind increased viewer counts is a false claim you have some serious logic issues
What you want is not the demand of the whole community
SSL and GSL having a bigger prize pool does not mean there is more money in the korean scene Does the korean scene have more money than before if you count all the money won in dreamhacks IEM s and other foreign tournaments by koreans in 2015 as money in the korean scene Because otherwise that is total bs
Why should it They are foreign scene tournaments that not all Koreans are able to go to Do you count the 1080 that the global seeds won in SSL 2015 as part of the foreign scene The money for noname Koreans well there are very few nonames because the system has been bad for 3 years but the low level Koreans has gone up massively Which was the point
Take Solar or Parting They both made a lot of money outside of Korea presumably they would have made much less money with this system That s money no longer going to koreans I dont see why you wouldnt count it Both those players would have had a really bad year especially Solar if it werent for those foreign tournaments and might have retired There might be more money in Korea but if the koreans are making less money then it doesnt really matter And I dont see why you wouldnt count that money as part of the foreign scene it was literally guaranteed for foreigners
I am a fan of many Esports one of them being League of Legends Thats the only sentence I read What a fuckhead I never liked that idiot

Show them your dick you ll see what I m talking about
Don t forget Q What are you going to do with the money A Going to my family
Do they feel obligated in Korea to pay their parents for raising them up or something
I m sure someone else could give a more accurate answer than I but you re pretty close It has very much to do with the more family centric seniority structure aka they are my parents and we re family therefore money should go to the family
Are Koreans trained to say that in their team houses
I want a Sojung reaction headshot for every interesting moment like they have on Japanese TV

Korean Starcraft so interesting apart from the players
I don t find anything entertaining about meaningless drama between fucking video game players so I much prefer it that way Quiet respectful dedicated to their craft That s interesting to me if I was interested in drama I d watch a fucking reality show
Oh come on you gotta admit that MC s shenanigans and Parting s bombast were entertaining
MC was fine by me he was cocky but nothing overly offensive I was referring more to all the stupid shit that went on in the NA EU scene a few years back The SC2 subreddit back then was completely inundated with the worst type of drama KELLYMILIKES BROKE UP WITH MOONGLADE OMG WUT A WHORE NANIWA DID SOMETHING AUTISTIC OMG LOL
Not overly offensive He dropped a manner nexus on July I love the man but that shit was heresy

Clearly you re not into the fighting game scene It would change your opinion Having beef between players make the match feel like more is on the line Having players with personality gives you someone to root for their journey becomes your journey as well If you think that having interesting non robotic players wouldn t improve starcraft 2 then either you are a robot or have never watched any other form of competition and seen how much it s improved by some personality being injected into it
You can also find them in lower league games and League of Legends Ragers ga lore
Or UFC
I don t tune in to watch a goddamn soap opera Some trash talk is fine but seriously I don t care about this week s Twitter drama or whatever crap happened in DesRow s chat for crying out loud I feel like it s a slap in the face that Blizzard is supporting these mediocre players when there are plenty of much more highly skilled Korean B teamers who would kill to have the opportunity that an NA or EU pro will get in this system
There is value in having a personality If your 1000 hour practiced play style matches the other 500 competitors how do you know who to root for
I m not saying that there isn t value in having personality Many of the very best Korean players have styles that differ from the standard meta But I really get annoyed when people are like Wow that guy is white and he almost speaks English RELATABLE STEPHANOUSA PLSDONTNERFINFESTOR
Spider Hyun say goodbye
MC Hyun and Parting being the exceptions
What are you talking about Innovation is such a funny and emotional player
Haha even more funny when you know that Innovation is even one of the more interesting Korean players lol
WHY WOULD YOU USE A KOREAN TEAM FLAIR THEN
There are many Korean and Foreign players I cheer for The tag has nothing to do with that And Nationality has nothing to do with my love for SC It s just a small support and thank you for TB and his wife Axiom never was my favorite team but I endorse was TB is doing for Starcraft I am a starcraft fan Not only a Korean Starcraft fan

god damn that beard is awful on him
That beard is starting to look like the longest pubes ever glued on his face He was much cooler with it less scraggly
Man Tasteless s beard looks awful What happened
late nights trying to defeat adepts kappa
I love that beard though
American men seem to love shitty beards right now It s very weird
But that s just like my opinion man No need to be a jerk about your opinion
Sorry
Don t worry about it man
That s actually an ISIS beard To grow out the beard and trim the moustache like that is described in the Sunnah and ISIS follows it closely
Taliban thinks its a funny beard I heard about it from a podcast about a guy who got captured by talibans and they found it funny to just shave the mustasch and leave the beard
Its not the beard that looks bad it just doesn t suit him He looks much better clean shaven or with some stubble than a full beard
Sorry to all the beards out there I offended with my comment
The shadowing makes it look worse than it is it needs a trim
So is he still casting then How come I never see him EDIT This is a legit question I m being sarcastic
Jeepers her English is perfect Wow
thats why a dreamhack quarters with 7 8 koreans is boring as hell
Since I care mainly about the gameplay I soooo much prefer 7 8 Koreans instead of foreigners that are worse than Korean b teamers
I like a mix of both Right now the main issue with WCS is that Korea needs a bit more money or support from somewhere injected into it They also need better support for amateurs because unlike the rest of the world Korean players have a relatively timed life because they have military service and many don t come back to the game after that
That seems more like a 99 useful fact
For a 99 uncommon scenario
For the 1 of games a battle cruiser is made
shit he s making immortals rush to battlecruiser
shit he s making battlecruisers have the immortals attack each other
Shit the immortals are attacking each other Build another cruiser and double Yamato them
Or just shoot them normally because immortals can t shoot air
Oh oh yeah huh
Or just activate shield
or activate the shield manually xD
Well in the last 1000 games I had played I haven t see one BC I m terran by the way
And who s fault is that
David Kim duh
mech terran all day
Make more BCs soldier They are super sweet and badass and therefore must be utilised
I m in bronze and I ve seen them in every game I play Why are they so bad
Their position in the tech tree combined with their cost build time and supply And the fact that they re not very good units in general
Do they just not do enough damage Aside from the yamato cannon of course
You better ask a Terran player for that All I know is that they re not worth building
They re in the same league as carriers shit until you have 10 or more of them then they re unstoppable
Yeah I got that shown to me about 15 minutes ago got killed by things other than battleships but survived then swarmed by them and then surrender
Indeed but still a very nice change of tone for the day
Bad advertising shameful work feardragon
A second 99 useless fact about the battlecruiser solely because it s about the battlecruiser
I wonder if the PB nerf will be enough to bring it back into late game TvZ My brain says no but my heart says believe
Whats PB
Parasitic Bomb AoE anti air Viper Spell Its being changed from 90 damage to 60 damage
thanks
Peanut butter
Parasitic bomb probably
Right because the reason a 400 hp unit wasn t being showed in game was because of a 15 dps spell
Correct Because to make cruisers work you actually need a lot of libs to deal with with the mass corrupter the Z will build And the PB nerf is significant against the lib
What s a Battlecruiser Next you re gonna tell me Protoss has Carriers right
New player here what is so bad about Carriers At the higher ranks to people micro their AA to just ignore the interceptors
It takes an eternity to build them They take almost 50 more time to build than Battlecruisers and Battlecruisers already build quite slowly It takes over 4 minutes to make 6 Carriers if you have 2 Stargates And then another 4 minutes when those Carriers are dead
Is it not worth it just to have 2 from 2 stargates I find them useful for taking out enemy medivacs and punishing his bad micro with AA because they will target the drones and not my mothership or void rays
Sure if it works for you but they re not used competitively very often
Question If you have the shield on autocast Does it activate before or after damage from a random attack is done
After I believe This is why the battlecruiser will normally one shot the immortal with a yamato cannon unless it s manually activated
Ah okay I wasnt sure since spells are sometimes speshul attacks
Legit question I agree with your line of thought
Now I m just waiting for that awesome PvT where there s a base trade situation it comes down to the last hit points of each players last building and the Terrans BC arrives at his base where the Protoss has just one Immortal left that s slowly been chipping away at the buildings HP The Yamato Cannon is charging and literally a split second before it hits the Protoss activates the shield allowing the Immortal to tank the hit kill the building and win the game Also it s the Blizzcon finals last map
The attack that would activate shields does full damage Then the shield activates
So it has come to this The panel layout is top down left right I tried reading it in the natural order then in the anime order and only then figured it out Do Chinese folk arrange panels like that Are you secretly Chinese feardragon Otherwise that s a pretty interesting fact
Haha sorry I tried to use the white line divider in the interest of showing it like a side by side comparison of the situations
I read it just fine
Yeah I noticed that after the fact And I understand why you d want to arrange it like that And maaaaybe my problem was that I was a little bit drunk But in the future please make the vertical divider bright green or red or something because well it s not noticeable enough the way it is
Sounds good Thanks for the feedback
Chiming in to say I m not drunk and also had a bit of confusion trying to figure it out A bigger divider might help or some arrows or just arranging it in typical 4 panel fashion
Don t dead open inside
Fuck I ctrl f d the thread to check if anyone allready said it I couldn t make sense out of this for the first 30 sec
You said it and I found it so here s the relevant link you didn t ask for
For what it s worth Chinese manga reads from left to right 3
Too bad Battlecruisers are absolutely useless 99 of the time anyways It s really a shame honestly as they are my favorite unit by far
Battlecruisers are great if you treat them like support units Plus having a Fusion Core around unlocks research options for making your units way more annoying
Same thing happens when 21 banes blow up on an immortal simultaneously vs 20 blowing up then 1
Upvote Upvote this post may be able to save this subreddit from spiraling into a pathetic vortex of drama
battlecruisers exist
What is this twitter drama you speak of if you don t mind my asking
Blowup Tuesday came early
To make the post more relevant to our sub it would be good to let everyone know that the immortal criticized the BC s penis size prior to this test
Minor nitpick the picture seems to imply that activating the shield with the BC that s going to yamato somehow increases the ability of the immortal to survive But that isn t true since yamato cannon has a 2 second duration and so does barrier By the time the yamato cannon hits the barrier would no longer be active However the fact is still relevant if you were to use another unit to activate the barrier first But the picture doesn t really show that so it s kinda misleading
That was my first thought in reading this post It would seem it is better to intentionally shoot the immortal activating the barrier and then wait another half second before using the Yamato to ensure that the Yamato canon will kill the immortal regardless of whether the barrier were activated manually or automatically as long as you were timing it correctly Perhaps teleporting in a second Battlecruiser and activating the Canon a split second after the first one after the initial regular shot would ensure a successful cannon shot How great would that be if battle BCs became the most micro intensive unit in late game TVP
Manually activating Barrier is often better Widow Mine is probably a much more common scenario Mine damage can be fully absorbed by manually activating Barrier but the Immortal will take hull damage and burn its Barrier if it s on autocast
That one is not useless Not at all
Feardragon did you hear about your competition
This scenario is wayy too useful to be here
Yeah attacking an immortal increases their survivability you re meant to attack once and then ignore it until the shield wears out
So much butthurt I almost want to make a meta post that this is a game that us early technophiles grew up with and a lot of older gamers respect and newer gamers love getting into What happened people Esports are a real thing and pretty awesome that it is recognized but still what in the 17 hells have we become
great another shitpost by a dunecoon
When a battle cruiser tries to yamato an immortal But when a battlecruiser yamato s an immortal that has its shield activated either manally or attacking it once It will kill it with one shot The immortal will survive with only shield damage taken So attacking the immortal before a yamato actually increases its ability to survive r CrappyDesign
Apparently the obvious white division down the middle was a bit more than you could handle
Apparently common sense of occidental way of reading things was a bit more than OP could handle
CSGO s real sport is entirely drivin by underage gambling
Yeah the business model preys on people with a problem It s all cosmetic but some people just can t help themselves
Omg now i really wished it would have been a 4 3 final so they could stand there and talk awkwardly for like an hour more And imagine if we still were in the swarmhost era omg
With the last game ending in a tie after 3 hours and a lifted CC The salt would have been real The CSGO guys are backing us up at least
Yeah most of those comments are really nice Good to see
Those comments are heart warming Counter Strike has had a very long history with an awesome competitive scene for many years Plus While I suck as CS GO I can t deny that its fun
real sports remove skins and watch 75 of their community instantly dissapear 4Head
And still have way bigger game than SC2 BibleThump
CS GO was a joke before they implented the skins
The dreamhack before the skins were introduced had a massive increase in viewers While the numbers would not be as big if there were no skins its a bit foolish to call it a joke Valve done some serious work to sort out the mess hidden path left The game was getting better and the community was growing a fair amount without skins Obviously skins blown it up but lets not make things up and say it was a joke
Really Because CSGO before cosmetics to support esports teams was much smaller than SC2 is now
That s because everyone was still playing Source and 1 6
The competative source scene was never existent http wiki teamliquid net counterstrike Premier Tournaments Just look at the big amount of premier css tournaments 1 6 wasn t that big either at that point of time cite needed CS skyrocketed with cs go and the fucking skins that is kinda the sad news but also ok I guess At least its an esport and not candycrush
I remember when css came out I think they switched for 1 major tourney then went right back to 1 6 because source fucking sucked
cs 1 6 had a long storied history It was played for money for 12 years I have no idea what point you are trying to make Source was not a good game It was like seen a less skilled nooby version of 1 6 A bit like Broodwar to sc2
I never said that 1 6 was not played also I never said that it was not played for money as I shared the premier tournaments history it would pretty dump to say sth like that I said that the scene was WAY smaller then cs go todayespecially if you think about the fanbase and viewer counts for streams and events 1 6 was played a lot I never wanted to question that
Yeah was is the key word Even if 90 left CS GO it d still be bigger than StarCraft It s on a completely different level
Thats not true sc2 has a current ranked 1v1 player base of 300k just for lotv And another 100k for wol and hots players However the majority of people that watch starcraft dont even play the game The total viewer number is much higher The stream numbers werent 10x the sc2 numbers cs go averaged around 75 k on day 1 2 and sc2 averaged 30 40k
OK so let s talk about numbers SC2 let s take 400k as playerbase in total which is people who played at least one ranked game Add people who don t play ranked and assume we got 500k in total CS GO players in last 2 weeks a little over 7 5 million Overall almost 18 million has played CS GO so let s assume they have around 10 million active players I don t think it s very generous on my side and a reasonable estimate StarCraft 2 has 5 of CS GO playerbase There are more concurrent CS GO players than total SC2 players Now do we really want to go into viewership numbers SC2 Final 43k peak 31k average That s less than polish caster had during VirtusPro CS GO games Take into consideration people who watch CS GO in game It s not even comparable SC2 is nowhere near CS
Numbers are boring and fairly misleading I played Broodwar on professional level so did I with Starcraft 2 I played from CS 1 5 through GO and greatly enjoy all games CSGO is a great game and I love that eSports is growing with it but saying viewership is greater is misleading Viewership is greater if you compare the raw data but its not greater if you compare the of playerbase vs viewership You will find out that tons of players that play CS do not watch CS Ofcourse thats the case for Starcraft 2 as well but its way less viewer vise Starcraft II is amazing 40000 of 400000 is 10 of the whole base watching If you take those 18 million and even if you mind say every major peaks at over 1 million its still no where near the of viewer that Starcraft gets Also in terms of records Broodwar holds the record for the biggest live audience 120 000 SKY Pro League Finals It simply bores me that people like Sadokist show no respect or try to be funny I don t blame CSGO or CS for it but it saddens me Because I want all eSport to grow and to spit on the thing that played a huge role in creating eSport overall which seemingly gives him is absolutely unacceptable
Well you compare different numbers 18 million is total number of CS GO copies sold all time LoTV sold 1 million in first 24 hours so how much did it sell in total 2 million 40000 of 2000000 is how much 2 That s actually less than 1 18 which gives CS GO better numbers If you look at people actually playing the game it s very similar 1 million of around 10 million is 10 but CS GO has more than 1 million viewers It be around that number on Twitch but there s also shitton of people watching it in game So even this viewer statistic is in favor of CS
Nice to see numbers for once Too many people just spew out nonsense
Nah shall we predict the viewer counts for katowice finals I would say 1 3 million for cs go and 100 000 150 000 for starcraft
70 80K for Starcraft and 1 15 million for Katowice
During the community event in the summer hosted by Blizzard they reported the unique monthly SC2 player number at 2 million
That includes unranked arcade and customs It s anyone that opened sc2 at all Ranked 1v1 is a very small part of the player base
Way bigger game yet way less prize money in tournaments source and that s a teamgame vs 1v1 Considering how much money valve presumably makes from those skin sales it s kinda odd people aren t more suspicious of that business model tbh
3340 tournaments vs 571 tournaments It also doesn t count sticker money that teams receive
Oh thanks for pointing out didn t know about team benefiting from sticker sales any estimate on how much players gain from that personally If you compare the other games in the top 5 all except SC2 are 5v5 games so it s kinda natural to me to have less tournaments because there s simply more people to consider no All I m saying is if you look at the raw numbers earned per player through tournaments there seems to be quite the difference between CS GO and SC2 yet if you look at viewer numbers revenue made by respective developers through skin sales etc it just doesn t seem Valve is pouring much money back into the scene
Actually I believe Valve is screwing the scene super hard but mostly in DOTA case I think Compendium and amount of money made from it compared to what we receive in return is disgusting Players teams received 4 2 million dollars from stickers from IEM Cologne I m not sure what the split is withing the teams with org but I believe in most cases it s 100 for the players VirtusPro received 1 5 million and that s only 1 event Every major tournament has stickers so you can do the math and see where the money is
LOL
Then why not Blizzard have more skins for LOTV Genuinely curious because there are so many skin slots which are empty
They are plannign to release skins and voice packs it has been confirmed shortly after LotV launch if I recall correctly Along with the new ladder I hope it will revitalize things a bit Honestly they should have pushed that co op missions are free can be played with starter edition much more I think their marketing is really lackluster
To me this just seems like a failed attempt at humour by somebody who is chronically unfunny Leave the poor man alone
Yeah He d do anything to get a laugh Except say something funny
If he uses Twitter it is most likely broken right now
Lets not continue the trend of shitting on other games just because our epeen gets called out This hurts me as someone who enjoys watching playing CS GO alot but it makes me think less of Sadokist not the game Lets be better than that
Thank god
Played two games of Protoss Must not be a real sport Logic
Too bad he didnt play two games of terran he would surely have seen the light and abandoned his filthy CS ways
Its a joke
We make fun of other esports mainly LoL though all the time its all in good fun
Doesn t really seems like it s in good fun for me but to be honest I don t really care what they say
WORDS CANT BRING MEEEEE DOWN
Sticks and stones may break my pylons but words will never hurt me
I AM BEAUTIFUUULLLL NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY
There s a difference between fanbase shitting on other games thinking their game is the best and a professional that gets payed by the tournament organizer host talking shit on it they were likely told to give an update on the delays and he chose to place the blame on SC2 instead of literally doing the job he was hired payed to do fill time between games series keep audience engaged and interested in what s to come
Our CSGObros are backing us up
Our CSBrO s 3
Would have been fine if they had something funny or witty to say but now it just leaves bad taste as it wasn t intelligent or funny in any way or form Just trying to straight up insult other esport but failing to come up with something good to say This short clip makes me realise of how good we have it in sc2 with our casters and analysts
Would have sorry it s just one of those things
Thanks feeling silly for making such a mistake
Except all the CS GO kiddos think that was really cool and is the truth
Go look at their reddit then most on there thought it was stupid
To add a bit more When faced with time stuff like this casters have previous games to go over to remind people of what happened or key points that allowed teams to advance They have the option to talk about the venue crowd plays sponsers hosts They Can talk about the excitement of the other game currently going on or help fill people in Hey there is currently a SC tournament on the main stage which is currently a best of 7 If you want to watch the live stream check out twitch dreamhack SC In the mean time we are going to go over the major points in which each team is going to need to address if they want to push their edge in the upcoming games If E sports wants to be taken seriously By large sponsors companies coperations ect then the castors and hosts need to lead by example The hosts we had at this event did an excellent job I hope they do not return fire at any time because Esports in general is looking to get bigger and we are all on the same boat if it sinks
paid
I m not trying to defend Sadokist here or anything as I play both games but just this week Tasteless and Artosis did the same thing Saying that SC2 and Brood War were tied for 1 in the world and the rest were all tied for silver Which as was said about an hour earlier or something silver is the first loser I don t think it matters though SC2 gets to take pride in the fact that it is 100 the most difficult game And this is coming from a 1 6 heavily competitive player cal m LANs etc
The tied for first and all seems like a much healthier jab though it s very obviously playful and reveling in the fact that eSports everywhere is huge now This guy is straight up smug BM
I see what you mean but that s kinda just Sado I m not saying it s right and in reality we should all be backing each other up But he talks the same type of smack about teams in CS all the time I dunno I guess I just don t see him as being serious But then again I don t even like his casting in the first place
hahah yeah I m not a big fan of CS personalities but you re absolutely right on both fronts We all smack talk each other at the end of the day though we should and do back each other up
SC2 isn t even the most difficult starcraft game
I think he really didnt mean anything by it To me it seemed just seemed like a bad decision Im sure later when he thought about it he cringed like the guy in the middle
As someone who primarily plays cs and watches sc2 for entertainment I don t even know who any of those hosts deskmen are They re no name idiots trying to make a name for themselves casting at a minor event
I don t know I don t have a problem with someone making fun of something I like as a joke but this wasn t funny at all and he didn t even really make a joke it was just Starcraft 2 sucks but I haven t played it and that s literally all he said It was just an awkward unfunny joke
Yeah I agree with you lol all esports make fun of all esports These guys seemed maybe a bit doucheyer than usual but this sub massively shit talks LoL in a similar manner
I don t see how you can think this is a good comparison This was the host of the CS GO panel at dreamhack claiming SC2 wasn t a real esport not some random scrub on a subreddit
Passion stone Heroes of the passion League and Dota have been poked at in majors before I know Tasteless and Artosis do it As I said in the original comment the razzing these guys gave seemed a bit too far but I don t think it merits a thread of outrage
Tasteless was a top ranked Cardstone player a long time ago and I think some of the EU panelists Tod Maybe I don t remember play Heroes of the Casuals Plus those two are both blizzard games
I really don t mind people talking shit on reddit or people talking shit in jest But starcraft casters would never shittalk another esport in a similar manner because it is showing less respect to our common scene and the event organizer I think they would rather say while you are waiting maybe check out the cs go final its looking pretty exciting etcetc
Passion stone heroes of the Passion and League albeit only once or twice on league get poked at on stream that said I do think these guys came off a bit too bm see original comment
well I mean CS is an esport made for the cool kids who cant really play an actual computer game that requires skill like starcraft so they just settle for some twitching on a 5 year old map and allow themselves to shout because some random guy with a sniper rifle managed to headshot a guy 15 meters away from him
I feel like you are the Trump of this sub
my bad I shouldve added this
Nice Joke
Thanks
This sub is fucking great sometimes
To play devils advocate CS takes alot of individual skill like starcraft as well as team work and some of these maps are pushing 15 years old Haha
sure they take skill if youre not american no seriously im kidding I thought it was obvious sorry
you sure showed those people in the video who s the better man
Dust 2 is a lot older A lot older If I have to guess I think I played on dust 2 15 years ago
His joke isn t funny though it just sounds mean Thats like a football player saying golf or tennis isn t a real sport because it 1v1 or 1vall
yeah at least usually when the subreddit jokes about LoL it tries to be witty that was just awkward
Sorry i ve never seen Starcraft commentators saying LoL is shit on stage Making fun is one thing but this here is something different
This is what we call a bad joke executed poorly It s still making fun it s just not funny I honestly don t see the big deal and wouldn t mind if commentators would poke fun at other games in casts in situations where the topic made sense like in this example where the caster gets info on the SC2 finals progression in terms of when their finals will start
2013 CS GO at Dreamhack called It said be thankful for what you have now
Meh didn t seem that malicious he was just circlejerking for the CSGO fans
Yeah this post is a bit of an overreaction if you ask me
a bit of
Rofl in 2012 2013 CS GO was the most dead game it could be If SC2 community would be 10x smaller than it is now it still would be bigger than CS then They had like 2 3 tours a year could not even compete with any e sports at all EVER IEM didn t even want to do their events XD No tournament matched any viewers Dreamhacks main stage was SC2 and CSGO was played in some shithole in the building I don t remember SC2 community making fun of cs then at all
Skin betting is the biggest reason why CS became popular in the first place sadly besides the competitiveness of SC2 there s not really much to offer as an esport compared to the current big names
See the parallel here Today its the other way around Thats because Valve actually saw CSGO in the state that it was shit and began to actively fix it I remember that it really was a badly built game but Valve fixed it What Valve also saw was money potential They monetized skins and created a marketplace for people to create skins FOR them basically free money Id buy skins in SC2 Where they at Now blizzard has been improving a bit by implementing tourneys and making the game less boring but its really not the same magnitude as Valve
Well it was mentioned by blizzard that skins may become a thing in the near future
I completely agree
Eh but at least they re doing it Eventually
but what about now
valve realised the hats in dota were working and they would work for cs go also
Now they ve annoyed the hive
Yes let s bring up even more drama out of nothing
Oh come on they were being dicks Our professional casters wouldn t do such a thing
The only thing we are actually good at in this sub
Watching this helped me realize why there was 0 hype in the crowd Also helped me realize why only the finals were shown on the main stage
What a cunt
it s a joke please chill out haha our casters analysts should make a joke about CS next time
it s not about the joke itself but the delivery Not only they went with the most basic meme which is the ded game because they know no better the guy said Starcraft is not real sport What the fuck It is THE eSports game Passionstone is funny because it implies Artosis and the whole story without being condescending You can go full le epic memester but have at least some wit or respect
It wasn t a joke and it wasn t funny It was an obnoxious comment about SC2 and a direct attack He said to put 5 computers in the booth as it should be And claimed SC2 is not a real esport He s a complete moron
Sorry to correct you but bw takes much more skill than sc2 not saying it s better or not but difficulty and skill ceiling are much much higher in bw
This Real sports do it all the time I enjoy gaming as a whole but being able to make light of each other in gold nature will help us grow together No need to white knite your community I welcome the return banter from SC2 hosts as with LoL and Dota
Do they Have you ever watched sports Their broadcasters are so concerned with creating interesting storylines and analysis for their viewers about the event at hand that they don t have time to ever mention another sport How do you honestly think it would come across if during a basketball game preempted by the super bowl the commentators made concussion jokes and said football wasn t a real sport because so many people never touched the ball and besides a football isn t even round Look man I get that it s hard to be on stream for so long while stalling for another game to wrap up and that this might just be a bad moment for you being highlighted unfairly but that string of comments was flat out rude How is calling the grand finals of another esport at the event irrelevant supposed to help the genre as a whole There was nothing fun or in good nature about what you said and your delivery was just terrible if that was the mood you were trying to convey If you wanna poke fun that s fine Very few of us are so uptight that we can t take a joke but that wasn t a joke it was more like some kid pushing you in the mud and calling you a faggot and then telling a grown up it was all in good fun when he gets in trouble Just be more aware that you re a professional I can only assume you would like to be viewed as one and right out shitting on another game is the antithesis of professionalism tldr being a dick is not making light of each other in gold sic nature
Never seen a commentator from a sporting event make fun of another sport dunno what ur talking about
No one recognized that you re the one in the VOD
ugh Like I love the counter strike community but that was such an ignorant comment who is that guy anyway
That was in really poor taste but let s not put CS GO down over it Both are good games I prefer SC2 by a good margin but I wish I had enough time to get good at both
Problem is that his delivery cannot be definitively interpreted as joking He did not say just kidding or laugh at himself instead his presentation is easily correlated to a person who s serious about what he is saying It can be interpreted both ways as a deadpan comedy or as an arrogant statement Anyone who concludes from the video that the analyst is 100 joking is making a wishful assumption on behalf of the guy It s entirely the analyst s fault for making himself ambiguous
Wow these guys are terrible They look so awkward in front of a camera it really makes you appreciate our casters
Meh I m all for bantz All in good fun
Seemed like he was quite serious If he had accompanied it with a smile and a chuckle i would ve thought nothing of it but now i m quite disappointed in Sadokist
For proper bantz the other party should be able to defend his or her self
except in my experience csgo players have always been the worst of making fun of starcraft As well as this segregating a community that should be working together to become mainstream is a pretty bad idea
Uhh CSGO when it came out was actually dead It was poorly balanced poorly optimized maps were buggy and there weren t any skins I have no recollection of people shitting on CSS or 1 6
The csgo analysts make fun of dota 2 as well and probably every other game no need to get upset about it
Let s find this guy and sacrifice his first born to David Kim Three Two One GOGO
Guys are just having fun Do people have to take everything so seriously
It was the way he delivered it that made it seem sincere
Meh he s just taking shots anyone who has watched played sc2 knows it s by far the hardest esport and the only one you can make me a high level cs go player and dota player call a sport it s the only thing even close to being a real sport in this world of electronic games drawing viewership and therefore money edit how about we make these people try a starcraft 2 game it ll be hillarious
how about we make some starcraft player that has never touched the game try dota lol or cs go It can really go either way The same goes for soccer and basketball basketball and tennis People could go for ever This trend of My game is superior and harder and a real sport is so fucking cancer and cringey specially when it started right here in the SC2 community when LoL started to get huge and the SC2 scene to die out If someone actually thinks that way seriously I don t know what else to say
Sure there s a learning curve to every game but that doesn t mean that those other games are more difficult that SC2 all around
At least our analysts don t look so retarded Apollo can put that host in his backpocket
Who are these losers
Fuck this guy and the other one and the guy in the middle too Fuck the cameraman also Damn i feel way better now
fuck this guy
While poking fun is okay this is why making dead game jokes is so terrible
Other people not enjoying the things I do doesn t make them bad people or make me enjoy it any less I don t know how we as a community can criticize them for making fun of Starcraft when we as a community say things 1000 times worse about the game the pros the casters and the developer on a daily basis Edit Typo
CSGO more like CS1 6 real game
hahahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha OMG that joke bets of 2016 CSGO a real sport man that comedian is so good man ohh he is a real caster talking for real oh well Rip
real sports lmfao probably doesn t know how much skill and knowledge there is involved in high level sc2
probably wouldn t care anyway
Csgo is a very difficult game
sc2 is a very difficult game
Both difficult games
exactly
LoL is a very easy game
At least Valve cares about their game
Valve aside from their Steam platform only cares about their money making games CSGO and DotA 2 I would say TF2 but it just seems like Valve stopped caring about TF2 Also I hadn t heard any news about Left4Dead 2 which quite literally seems left for dead
Ye thats why they some months ago released a fucking revolver weapon that was better then rifles at the begninig Valve is not doing an amazing job with cs go that people think
Can t we all unite to collectively shit on mobas instead
Nothing to get butt hurt over Our community shits on LOL HOTS and HS all the time A little unprofessional of them but who the fuck really cares
Community Those are on the stage being employed Unlike the anonymus people that are only doing what they like those guys have a responsibility as analists being payed That being said no one should care really Even if you do the best action is to ignore idiots
The fact of the matter is CS GO and MoBAS are more accessible to casual players SC2 However makes inexperienced players quiver at the thought of memorizing hotkeys and having to be perfect with your game play It s obvious to anyone who plays both game which one has the higher skill cap
I play and watch both CS Go and StarCraft this makes me very sad Why should we differentiate E Sports when there is already so much competition with other entertainment industries This man and his mindset is stagnant
Is dreamhack rly OK with this
Holy shit this sub is mature when thorin did a similar joke about dota everyone on r dota2 lost their shit
You guys need to stop being children who gives a fuck you guys make fun of other esports all the time
Wow that s kind of disgusting
Just seems like awkward banter to me
Haters gonna hate alivegaem
itt people can t take a little banter
An alive game cringe
Am I the only one who can t play oddshots on a phone
Does anyone have the exact time in twitch where he said it I d love to see the twitch chat s reaction during this time EDIT Found It I didn t know what I expected
i really hate how people who play videogames insult the talents and skills of people who play other videogames that said i tried cs go recently i didn t play it ten years ago i played it for about 30 hours i m not insulting the game i haven t played it even a small amount really just 30 hours but i honestly find it to be about the most uninteresting e sport around i really just dont get it i d honestly rather play metalgear solid 5 fob missions i did that for like 30 hours in itself and i d be more than happy to for another 30 hours i m pretty much done with cs go got it on steams holiday sale though for like 7 00 7 for thirty hours is a pretty good deal i guess
protoss master race
Well Sadokist is always shittalking nothing new here i guess
It was a joke
Hmm Suddenly i don t like that guy anymore Oh well CSGO and Sc2 are still both awsome games
I ll take the Starcraft 2 scene over any other FOREVER
This is what kills the scene
A real sport game a easy game to master Starcraft Hard game to master
I think the guy was genuinely pissed that he had to wait for the main stage Poor baby Too bad we didn t have an epic 5 hour final series
Wow you guys really can t take a joke
God some people in the starcraft community are so precious about the game dying off as an esport It was a joke its not a big deal I will watch sc2 till for as long as they keep having high level games Chill out
CS GO players Never played Starcraft Starcraft players i play like 6 hours of CS GO a week
What a moron Tried to be funny but failed
Wow this was totally unprovoked and those idiots are actually have a responsibility for being employed Way to go sparking quarrels and shit throwing really professional Please do not make a deal out of those idiots they don t deserve it
Jesus Christ guys stop overreacting It s just a fucking joke They re not actually shitting on sc2
They too could enjoy Starcraft had they developed their cognitive thinking abilities
ahahha D
I dunno why but I felt that guy in glasses was legitimately salty for not having the main stage lol It s all good fun tho don t get so upset guys
a real sport everyone and their mother knows Starcraft is probably the HARDEST esport to play It s like bowlers making fun of basketball players for not playing a real sport
Ye because CS GO community is so nice where you can solo que and always have good and nice teammates s If you are not earning money from CS I would more defiently be a part of SC2 community if I had to chose Because in SC2 you can actually have a good game whenever you like And not like in CS GO where you only can have a good game if you are full premade
It s all fun and games If there is anyone being offended by this Don t Please
The sc2 community shits on all other games all the time lol DansGame dota DansGame csgo DansGame We show no respect to other games now we are made fun of and you are upset
tbh csgo is an esport that lives off of the skin market and the betting gambling that comes with it A while back some teams even got paid with skins Without skins csgo would be as dead as starcraft That said i enjoy playing and watching csgo too
Then sc2 needs the same thing as csgo
I don t think any SC2 professional or caster analysis that is paid has ever outright on a live stream called another game straight up dead or not a real esport
The live game comment by the other guy I can see as just a joke but the real game comment was just idiotic
It s some light hearted bantz intended to be heard by the cs go community This is literally the most defensive gaming community I ve ever seen been a part of Lighten up people
What ever happened to this https www reddit com r starcraft comments 2zp21v kespa announces monthly sc2 rookie league
Maybe it s this https www youtube com playlist list PLNYMRZg6wLuRoqnes9KSsxgBv Tukbm8l
TIL whatever that is exists
This is amateur league casted by Canata Canata s the most popular figure in SC2 right now The fans love this guy because he s funny very good at sc2 and really loves this game
Sup Canata
Nice try Canata
any english casts i miss Husky or HD who would cast any replays they can get their hands on
Falcon paladin on youtube is filling that niche
We have ran a rookie league for the past few months It is not broadcasted though but you can find information here http e sports or kr board php module data page list b no 6 b category column b subject keyword B7 E7 C5 B0 B8 AE B1 D7 x 0 y 0
Well you should get on it then foreigner fans are really eager to support the korean scene and to see new blood
This The ESV TV Weekly s received hundreds of viewers and sometimes the finals were in excess of a thousand Its also where I first learned about Life and Taeja
And even if you can t get a regular broadcast for the whole thing going which I d understand What if the finalists of the amateur leagues would play a showmatch their final before Proleague matches so they could get some publicity and we could take a look at the new talent With only seven teams in SPL the schedule should have some free space no
Wow thanks for bringing this up I never saw it I d love to know
First positive tweet today
deleted
TB has his own problems at the moment I don t think he s focusing on SC2 And that s not a crack at his health it s a crack at his unofficial subreddit which is basically the same thing as what is wrong with him right now
What
It s a cancer
I was basically calling the majority of the Cynical Brit subreddit community cancer at the very least they re acting like children Edit Oh they re following me I see how cute
They love you
I am gonna try and be optimistic I know a lot of Korean elitists as some would like to call them i am one of those elitists btw come off as jerks degrading the achievement of Drogo today and when MLord all killed Korea they came up with excuses for the Koreans thus degrading MLords win Just wanted to say I am happy for the Foreign players and the scene in general I hope with this new system the scene grows and gets better I am pretty sure EVERYONE wants that There is a lot of frustration though because Koreans are actually fucked over Yes there is ProLeague but ProLeague isn t for all Koreans What about the mid tier players who easily can compete and beat Foreigners as proven in the last years and the lower ones They now only have 2 seasons per Year and MAYBE 2 Kespa Cups I get it the community figures in the foreign scene are defending the new system and for good reasons It is aimed to help the foreign scene which is great and all but whenever they say yea just watch ProLeague GSL SSL and be happy with what you get it is an indirect fuck you or at least to me that is how it feels Hope they can do something for the lower and mid tier Koreans and please bring back 3 seasons worth of GSL and SSL ProLeague is awesome but not every Korean is in a Kespa Team and let s say one Korean you really like who is NOT in a Kespa Team is out of GSL and SSL That is 4 months or maybe more where he won t be playing anything except for a few online Tournaments maaaayybeee PS Sry if my english is not understandable at times and for my lack of punctuation skills
I find it hard to not be one of those Korean elitists When I got into StarCraft the foreign community was a small and tight community of enthusiasts The mainstream esports events were all Korean and we were so god damned thankful when a real Korean progamer would lower themselves enough to stomp on a bunch of foreigners How ungrateful to try and get rid of Koreans from foreign events Even worse to put the Korean SC2 scene at risk by locking Koreans out of so many tournaments In 2010 and earlier Korea was the StarCraft esports scene My position is so simple if StarCraft remains strong in Korea StarCraft will never die The foreign StarCraft scene was so much smaller than the SC2 foreign scene even now but we were all held together by our love of what was happening in Korea by watching games and supporting our favourite players learning from what they do trying to play more like them Korea showed no signs of mortality StarCraft was a big business like mainstream sports But Blizzard has been hitting them with curve balls ever since StarCraft 2 came out trying to control a scene they didn t create But if Korean StarCraft as we know it does eventually die our horcrux is gone When the foreign community peters out as the majority of the community moves on to new games like WarCraft 4 whenever that ends up happening there won t be much left for StarCraft That s why people like me are so upset by everything Blizzard does to make things harder for Koreans and the Korean scene in general I feel like that is our greatest safeguard against StarCraft 2 dying because it carried the foreign community for so long It s like foreigners are biting the hand that feeds them
Well there s the OlimoLeague which Olimoley has done a fantastic job with but I suppose that Patreon is mainly backed by foreign supporters so it doesn t really refute your point but it is a weekly KR tournament and it does help a lot
That link is from 2008 I m pretty sure you re talking about bw not sc2 and there was a reason that the foreign scene was like that back then it s cuz sc was never huge outside of Korea and by 2001 02 most foreigners that were able to play in Korea were retiring as the Koreans were starting to dominate bw was so big there it was on TV it was never very big outside of Korea though Sc2 on the other hand was bigger outside of Korea at the beginning
Oh yeah sorry I meant when I got into StarCraft in general Typo
What I don t understand is the idea that the changes will actively bring in new viewers It serves euro pros and people who just root for local heroes and it alienates the rest but I really can t see where the gain that will offset the loss is coming from
Maybe not new viewers as in people who are totally new to the game but maybe a way to at least get back older viewers who stopped watching because it is true Lots of people just wanna watch Foreigners duke it out which is fine I enjoy both and that is why I am happy for one side but when I look at the Korean scene atm it hurts a bit
Yeah maybe As a concept that s weird to me though alienate the current fans in the hopes of drawing in people that are no longer fans
Maybe it s just me but I really don t understand why people don t prefer watching the very best play instead of people they can relate with I m Canadian and when I watch nhl hockey I want my team to draft the very best talent not some scrub from my hometown that can t compete vs the very best I don t give two fucks what happens in interviews or outside the rink I just want the best fucking product on the ice as possible if that means all Russians or whatever I could care less less than half of the team I cheer for actually speaks English but they compete every game I really don t understand why it should be any different in e sports I don t want to be a dick but I feel if any foreigner wins any of the new wcs they don t really deserve it because it should no longer be called the World Championship Series it should be named Minor League series or something because to me it s second rate compared to GSL SSL etc
I guess I ll rephrase what I said I get why people think it but I think it s ridiculous oh wow twitter and interviews someone s been around for a while but never really won anything major because he s obviously not good enough to win but now that the skill level has dropped he s a contender My opinion is that the skill level of a game is what makes it fun not whatever these idiots say afterwards in most major sports when they interview players it s just terrible generic shit responses but nobody gives a fuck because those guys are the best at what they do Fuck if that s really what makes the games more exciting they would be better off just paying actors or having the casters playing in tournaments cuz they have the most well known personalities and can kill all the interviews if e sports wants to be taken seriously they need to get away from this we want personalities it makes the games more fun and stick with the formula of all major sports best players drafted Best players play Best players teams win
I am also one who enjoys the best play more than personalities and gimmicks That is the stuff I am looking for in streamers and not professional players That being said I have no problem watching Foreigners play against each other It can be fun though like I said I prefer the Koreans I just feel like there should be a way to salvage the situation for both Foreigners and Koreans I guess the next step for Koreans if they aren t getting more help from Blizzard is to start more community based stuff like Olimoleague Ideally Blizzard would support the Olimoleague and help create one or two more amateur leagues so the Korean scene can have some new blood that helps keeping the scene there alive
Totally agreed To be fair I don t mind the idea of minor league tournaments that don t have koreans but WCS is supposed to be the best in the world It would seem more honest if they took their name off the foreign circuit and admitted they didn t have money to do sc2 anywhere but blizzcon anymore
I have no problem with them running foreigner tourneys as well just change the fucking name
The WCS Not Korean haha
Sure just don t make it seem like these tournaments are world championships cuz new viewers will get the wrong idea that these foreigners are actually the best in the world and I don t think that s fair to all the Korean players that practice harder play more are more skilled deserve the distinction of being the best in the world
I always think its bs as well to call it World when you dont actually allow a certain skilled group to join w o some loop jumping
I think Don Cherry would disagree Everyone loves the good ol farm boy from Saskatchewan
Don Cherry is a fucking racist old man though Nobody that actually watches the game feels that way I don t know why you d even bring it up Of course we will love a home grown player but only IF that player can compete
Well let s not go that far I think he likes pk subban He does say some stupid stuff that s part of his schtik But some people do agree with him I was just using him as an example of those feelings in a different setting
People do agree with some things he s said but I certainly have never heard a hockey fan nowadays that would prefer hometown kid to a much more skilled player from somewhere else sure there may be some people around that think that but the overwhelming majority do not Also I love Don but he is quite the biggot there is alot of interviews sound bites that show this quite easily Also he thinks PK has tons of talent but he constantly talks shit about his attitude and how cocky he is while he will praise a good alberta kid that s white for doing the same shit he may not be completely racist but he is close
The theory is that the people who only want to watch Koreans are in a minority and that in order for Starcraft 2 to survive we need retain the majority of viewers who want to see local players
I think you need to prove that it s a minority then you d need to prove the other people will leave if this change doesn t happen or you need to prove that new people will suddenly care with the new change That all seems hard
part of the current fans i couldn t be bothered to watch any big event the last years because of Koreans i watched them if i saw it online on twitch but never set my alarm for it I did for this dreamhack and overslept T T I ve been in sc2 since 2010 gotten into masters many times and like to watch high quality games but korean1614 winning tournament x is just boring
Honestly I totally respect you for that I just wish the people who shared that opinion would stop pretending everyone wants that or that people who don t are wrong somehow
With the old model everyone was constantly complanig about the steady decline eventually it would fail this might work And we usually got tier 2 koreans winning foreign events maybe a few tier 1 that could come and mop the floor but we never saw gsl level games the whole tournament
I feel like you never watched tournaments from that description Yeah there would be some koreans that cut a swath through the rest but there would be plenty of euro matchups that were cool and as you got higher you got to see really good foreigners do their best against lower tier koreans always my fav part and then at the end you got solid korean players kicking the shit out of each other Made tournaments really varied and cool imo
I wish I can answer this without seeming salty at all because this discussion is indeed being pretty reasonable As for my understanding there are some misconceptions going on about the matter I honestly think all of us love to see games being played at the highest level so by no means I would deliberately screw koreans to favour foreigners The fact is that from the standpoint of a mostly SC2 fan that only used to play some BW offline the idea that talent would carry SC as an eSport is related to the way the scene worked in BW days i e a scene related to the undisputed biggest eSport of that time driven by the passion of hard core and competent fans that wanted to watch their top notch heroes fighting each other We find ourselves in a completely different situation now not only there are games that are WAY bigger than RTSs overall but especially in Korea SC2 is no longer able to be on par and has been shrinking and shrinking since 2010 for a lot of reasons Blizzard tried stuff like WCS region locks etc to allow SC2 business to re start on a different business model They thought they had to focus on the success of it among the foreigners to try make it bigger That s clearly the focus of the new 2016 WCS rule I don t know if it s right or wrong for certain I only know that with LotV coming out that was probably the last chance to try something really different What s the point in bashing this policy in the name of the hurdles of korean players Did the scene based on the skill of the top korean players take Starcraft in a better situation this 5 years not at all Does the sacrifice of the lesser ideally as small as possible part of korean professional scene to relieve the game and give it a future make sense It absolutely does Will it work Nor I neither anybody can answer the question yet Blizzard did their move let s wait and see it s not gonna take long to know
I bash it because it s racist change the fucking name if you are going to region lock Calling something the World Championship Series then saying sorry Korea can t participate cuz they are way better is a joke it s not the World anymore so if they wanna change it to NA Euro Championship Series then ok whatever
Is your username a reference to Shadows of Destiny
Actually it is taken from an anime called Full Metal Alchemist which i really enjoyed I played Shadows of Destiny and enjoyed it too though
Exactly And we should do more to help the mid teir basketball players in the USA They are being kept out if many foreign leagues in favor of local talent And what about the many better than the USA soccer players in Europe being kept out of MLS and other leagues We should also put together a fund for them Seriously this is not that uncommon The Korean players can play here in NA or EU if they are willing to move It is actually easier for them than basketball and soccer players that have quotas working against them At least the Koreans have the world s best training environment and the opportunity to go elsewhere
The difference is even though the whole comparison is sry that I say this stupid lower Tier and mid Tier Koreans hardly have a salary if at all which means if they get no support they will stop playing The High level Koreans will start retiring because they are bored wanna study military service etc and the scene will slowly but surely die Or maybe it will stay but we may no ProLeague anymore Even less tournaments and so on I NEVER said we should open foreign tournaments up for them That doesn t make any sense for the lower tier and lots of mid tier Koreans cause they don t have the money to fly themselves out and nobody is gonna do it for them Makes sense Why would a team send out their B teamer when they can send out their star player who will get guranteed money No what i was saying is that this year little was done to help the Korean scene compared to what was done to help the foreigners AGAIN because apparently I can t stress it out enough I am not saying to to take away from the foreigners
The difference is so great or stupid In both cases people want to be professional athletes People train hard And some people don t find an opportunity to succeed in their chosen sport despite being better than players in other parts of the world Very similar Sports is not a charity its a business As such the growth of the sport is of mist importance and not the success of individual players especially mid tier ones That is the goal of the limitations in WCS and the goal of the quotas in other sports
Why not try and have both foreigner scene that hopefully will grow and be better and the Korean scene be healthy It does nit have to be one or the other at least that is what i am hoping
I am hoping for the same thing Having a couple Koreans win a few foreign tournaments a year was not going to accomplish either The middle tier of Korea wasn t helped The foreign scene wasn t helped This new plan is supposed to help both independently Foreigners have better chances to be seen and compete in their own region Koreans have more money being pumped in and better streaming for visibility around the world There are still only 8 players advancing to the big stage during Blizzcon and they will probably all still be Korean but now there is a better chance at least one foreigner can crack through And finally there are several WCS Global events through the year where potentially foreigners and Koreans can both compete Sounds good We ll see how it works out
I think this is really awesome I hope this mean we are going to see some new faces very soon and not soonTM hopefully the KeSPAevryday and the Rookie guy are going to get picked up they seem to attend every Korean qualifier already
Kenzi is the best
i wish he clarified what the fuck he means by his tweets he never extends the info into more than a tweet his english seems passable but he never clarifies if its kind of vague and hard to understand people are left wondering like for example kenzi would post on tweeter about some piece of news say last year s announcement of an amateur tournament and we never hear anything about it from that source so much of what is actually happening in kr is in the dark to us it really makes me wish I knew korean I d translate stuff to clarify for people I m sure it d help a lot if we had specifics and follow ups to these announcements
Maybe because there s nothing to announce yet And he doesn t want to screw his sources by announcing specific info before it s supposed to be
Whoop Canata to the rescue It s been a long time coming but it s great that they are looking at solutions
Kenzi saving Twitter StarCraft ESPORTS
Nice plug Rifkin P
they should make a show of a group of rookies preparing for qualifiers Id totally watch that
Brought to you exclusively on Dingit the number one choice of all true fans of Sc2
dingit to sponsor a new sc2 team
If it does move forward It has been in spite of blizzard not because of it
i dont understand how you can just solve the new talent problem surely it either exists or doesnt
Honestly why doesn t Kespa step in and do something if there is such a problem with new talent in Korean sc2 scene I thought they were the be all end all of the Korean e sports scene
Does Korea have an equivalent to BasetradeTV Homestory Cup or any of the smaller tourneys I see going on
I don t think there even is a talent problem Either the game is popular and there are enough opportunities that young people want to give it a go or it keeps shrinking but at least some familiar names keep playing
This seems short sighted There are fewer opportunities for mid tier koreans making the scene harder to break into and not worth giving it a go
Why is that important for the success of the game as an esport I honestly don t understand currently
Did you just ask why it s bad for the esport that it s harder for new players to make money
It all depends on the influx of money from the sponsors anyway which in turn is determined by how much popular interest there is You could always argue for less top heavy distribution of what is there I guess but actively trying to recruit new young players is a different thing and doesn t seem like a priority when current players are retiring left and right undoubtedly partially because the money isn t there even for them
I feel like you re changing the subject At a low level if there is less incentive for new players the scene will suffer
Well it s not like these things exist in a vacuum and are completely independent of each other I guess I just don t see why you should be trying to create incentives for new players if the old players are leaving in masses because they don t have the incentives
Yeah that makes sense
The problem that Koreans are retiring usually isn t because of lack of incentives Many of the retiring players are still passionate but they have to go do military service and it is very rare for a pro to come back after those two years Because of that the Korean scene has more hard limits on the length of a career of a pro which means new players are even more important
the problem is a lot of top tier Korean players right now are around the same age group Say players like Zest herO soO sOs Classic etc are about the same age There s a thing called mandatory military services in Korea and they must serve in it so they will eventually have to retire and they are going to retire probably at the same time If we don t have new players to replace by then the scene is pretty dead What we need is young and new mid tiers Koreans to join the teams so by the time those players retire we have a brand new set to replace them The problem is we haven t really see any new players in a long time or simply we re not seeing enough of them
There s a lot of room to choose when exactly you do your military service as we ve seen though People like Bomber and MMA pushed it back because it was worth their while to stay in the scene but others have gone to do it earlier probably because they saw it better to move on now rather than later I d say it s all connected to how SC2 has been shrinking for years now Thanks for discussing my question rather than just downvoting
Well even if they delay going to the military they will go eventually then it comes back to the problem that we don t have anyone to replace them doesn t it Also with a game like StarCraft 23 which is where many of the top players are at some older is already considered past their prime SC2 apparently can keep people around longer but not much So would you rather we have youngsters coming in now and getting experience learning from the best while they are still good or would you rather we wait 1 2 year until our current players conditions are no longer great some already have left by then to start bringing in newbies who are also not that good Not even counting if there are actually newbies who want to join by then since the big names have been dominating for so long taking all the money
Because making the step to go pro and essentially dedicate your life to sc2 by practicing 12 hours a day means you no longer have time for school work so if there is no legit way to make money when you make that step then why would anyone even bother even if they have the raw talent to become the next flash they probably will decide to move into something that gives them a better chance at some success instead of a huge grind with no salary less tournaments no way to make a living
Oh the fucking irony
it s like 1 retard making fun of another
Retardception
no this really was funny
I think you are both right
I think you are both wrong
a feud between TumescentPie and Avilo could be hillarious I would love to moderate a debate between the two
And I would love to watch Bring it on big boy
I think that Tumescent is the most delusional person ever but this thing was so funny XD
I m fascinated by how delusional he is The other day he was set on building a YouTube audience Asking chat how to get a million subscribers He is an idiot He is tragic He is hilarious But I will watch him whenever I get the chance
Dude streams for hours and although he is an idiot that shit entertains me But genius hehe that s going a bit far
inb4 he earns 5 figures a month on people like you
his stream is pretty small and his attempt to do this full time didn t work out
More power to him Though I very much doubt this will happen
I mean That s not really all that delusional of a question to ask though Is it
This made me laugh Probably his only useful contribution to the sc2 community ever Thank you
Dunno the context if this is in good fun or more malicious mocking intent either way i lol d This is all i have to say https www youtube com watch v qp6mXmHNPlg D
At least you have a sense of humor about it
Well if you lol ed then why am I banned in your room http imgur com 8loSmz7
they re both retards
Reading at the comments I feel like I m the only one who doesn t know this guy Fucking cracked me up I think this is hilarious sorry
hes probably most known around here for this https www youtube com watch v IJ8yfkLQ7So Hes a plat diamond level streamer and a chronic complainer of all things non terran He can be annoying especially to zerg and protoss players but I admit his stream is pretty funny sometimes both intentionally like in OP s post and when he gets mad and it turns into a train wreck like in the youtube video

This dude has scary eyes Like when he smiles they re just kind of empty o o
I played badly
He might not be a top player but the dude who made the video is making fun of him floating 2k with a 200 supply
Did you notice his hand placement One on the mouse one on his chin Then it zooms into the minerals pilling up
He was around 170 supply
was watching potato quality it was 169 though it was 199 anyway my point was that he lost that engagement for so many other reasons besides economy
You shouldn t be floating that much even when maxed especially as T You should be making more production and orbitals if you are maxed and have a bank
We know this We play Starcraft almost all of us
I tought the general consesus was that no one here played the game
I was replying to the guy that seemed to not know
I thought it was CombatEX at first
He s pretty much making fun of himself
Nah this is actually pretty funny shit Tumes is well on his way to meme dom
At least avilo is a GM player who kinda knows what he is talking about Tumescentpie is literally just a rager balance whining noob
HAHAHAHAHA this is amazing
tumescent so desperate to be relevant that he has to make fun of somebody almost as dumb as he is
You guys shouldn t make fun of Avilo and Tumescentpie They have uncontrollable aspergers and it s no laughing matter
I actually do feel sorry for Tumes and I don t make fun of him Out loud
all of the autism none of the talent funny if this were someone doing a tumescent impression he d be crying his eyes out about someone stealing his content
that was dank 5 7
Avilo at least got out of Platinum league right
Can we just go one day without seeing an Avilo pissing match on the front page
No
wow that s kinda funny
Sounds like HotS a week ago
I dont like avilo bashing but this one made me chuckle
This guy s a plat Diamond player who complains alot and gets alot of viewers Damn im a High diamond player who runs my own starcraft club in my university I should start streaming my complaints too
I m in the same boat we should make a podcast called The Weekly Salt
My favorite parts of Tume s stream is when he is getting ready to go out but keeps the stream open and answers questions I assume he never actually goes anywhere and just wants to make it seem like he has something better to do
Well he certainly goes to the gym so he has something to do He s also not hideous to look at so I would imagine he can at least get somewhere with temporary companions on a night out
Dont know why you d get downvoted for that comment Seems like a reasonable guess
This subreddit in particular isn t know for being reasonable Lots of kids here I suppose
He used to be married and has a daughter iirc
This is some next level bullshit from this sub
this made me lol
wait that is avilos room
Let s listen to the plat make fun of the speech impediment of a GM player that seems cool
Wow he even got the whiny bitch voice correct
shitty post
sounds more like boogie from youtube than avilo
I can t stop watching this WutFace
Damn almost an Incontrol level impression Hilarious
For a second i thought Avilo invited him God i hate this guy
I watched this and I thought it was really funny I don t know who this guy is Apparently this guy complains about balance as well at a diamond level BUT I still found it funny Can we enjoy this content
Of all the things to make fun of Avilo for this is the least legitimate Korean pros and coaches of Kespa teams have been complaining about the same thing Regardless of your position on balance it s pretty damn obvious that the game needs a patch The more people that push for it the better Blizzard isn t proactive about these things I dunno how you can fail at making fun of someone who paints as big a target on their back as Avilo
This trash player attempting to stay relevant
hahah i made that oddshot D
Actually kind of funny but if there s one person that complains about balance more than Avilo it s TumescentPie Downvoted simply because it s about him
Like I give a shit about the rules Come at me iBleedOrange Also what is this adding to the conversation mate Just another shitpost GTFO
This is considered Content Just because you disagree with the guy featured doesn t mean you are supposed to down vote it u iBleeedorange
Why do the majority of people in this subreddit have to act like this is preschool Grow up
When in Rome You ll find that the majority of people on r starcraft are of preschool mentality
u iBleeedorange you mean this guy
OH NOES YOU TAGGED A MOD IN HOPES I GET BANNED Keep shit posting bruh
https www youtube com watch v OGp9P6QvMjY
are you the reddit police
No he just seems somewhat mature Might even be an adult If only we had some of those around here
lmaoing IRL that one fucking turbonerd who read the rules LAMO
this is bullying
it s satire
As you can see further up in the thread Avilo took it in good humour He s a big boy now he can look after himself
This is outstanding I give it 4 out of 5 Kappas
At this point they should literally just reset everybody s MMR and remove the leave league button I m sure there are other ways to fix it but they don t seem to be capable of doing it
Or they are once again thinking that waiting 5 months or so till the ladder revamp is ready is fine It s not Not at all I m sick of wasting my time trashing players who think that it s cool to play vs players miles ahead of oneself
I m just tired of getting 1 and 2 points to be honest I don t mind trashing trash but at least give me 10 points for wasting my time smh
This alleged bug doesn t actually exist Either they fixed it or it never happened at all I leave I get matched right back where I was A lot of noise about a absolutely nothing
I think new ranked system is going to reset everybody s MMR anyways
Why do we even need the button to begin with Let us be promoted and demoted like any other game and your league will eventually be accurate
How can it really take this long for Blizzard to fix this bug Is there something im missing
The technology isn t there yet
Please understand
passion
incentives
wat
INCENTIVES
good shit good shit
Wot
I dont even know man I didn t understand what he meant with incentive But it s all good all good I love you all
this entire post is stupid they locked rank so if ur mmr is high enough u can be in plat but reach master lvl and perhaps face GM just take a look at the picture of the plat vs GM the stats on both sides are close and it doesnt seem like it was a bad game pretty sure that plat isnt really plat but master or high diamond
A bit of a ridiculous question but one to which I d like an answer as I don t really understand this leave league bug will the leave league abusers actually be placed into higher leagues in the new season or is the MMR boost completely artificial and temporary
The leave league glitch basically gives you top gm mmr but still makes it so everyone you play only gets 1 point for winning and 20 for losing It s complete bullshit I left league after tilting once and had to buy a new account just to ladder
That s absurd I guess my next question is whether or not these people just abuse the glitch to play against top GMs or will they actually receive promotions based off of their new MMR when they complete the placement game s
I was playing against high gm for 5 placement games after I left league my previous mmr was high masters and was placed into platinum league None of it makes sense Haven t played on that account since
I guess that s good news in a way The glitch would only be worse if people were obtaining false promotions from it and inflating the higher leagues Still I can t imagine the pros are having an easy time finding practice right now
I actually thought it was fixed on NA I haven t played any leave leaguers since they reset gm
That s not true I lost 20 in a row and my mmr was still high gm mmr
Yeah the glitch doesn t just hurt GM players It makes the Leave League button a permanently kill my account button Anyone who presses that is screwed
I used the leave league button a few days ago because I wanted to see what it did Nothing like that happened I just had to redo my placement matches
nope you can just play an automated tourney and your mmr is fine again
Can t they just tank their MMR back to Diamond level or whatever
Yeah but Hyperbole is more fun Than 50 loses in a row D
No it doesn t seem to give out free promos as far as we can tell You get shoved back into dia plat but it does permanently fuck your MMR so you have to go on a losing streak to get back where you were
If they know this is a issue can t they just disable the leave league button for a temporary fix until the issue is fully solved
i agree When playing a game like league of legends you always see broken shit disabled with reasons right at the top of the launcher Dont understand how they can let things go for so long Especially in the first season of a new expansion when you hope to hook in new and returning players
wat this is still a thing
I don t understand why blizzard isn t doing anything This ruins a lot of people s experience and lots of pros have been complaining for months now Seems like the easiest fix in the world
If it seems like the easiest fix in the world and you re not a computer programmer it s probably an incredibly complex and difficult problem to fix
Then why not disable the button until it s fixed I also can t believe it to be very difficult when simply putting an upper limit on the placement matches MMR would fix the issue
In the time Blizzard hasn t fixed this NASA could ve probably programmed a small rover to land on Mars
If it only happens sometimes it may be very difficult to determine exactly under what conditions the bug appears If it happens everytime and they can reliably reproduce it then it should be fairly easy to fix I used the leave league button and I did not experience the bug so it is at least somewhat intermittent
Yes There is actually an easy to spot problem but it s got nothing to do with programming https en wikipedia org wiki Dunning Kruger effect
Yeah I would agree that the the starcraft community and gamers in general when complaining about games represent pretty much a textbook example of that This thread is littered with comments about Blizzard being the laziest game company and don t care at all about the game etc I mean if you think about it for one second comparing the overall quality of blizzerd games vs most other companies it s just such a ridiculous thing to say I just shake my head and wonder how these people don t realize they have literally zero knowledge of what they are talking about
Well if the problem is easily reproducible it won t be hard finding the cause and working on it
That reminds me of Maximus Black playing League of Legends last year on a boosted account He went onto a long losing streak and went on complaining about how bad his team was playing etc while being oblivious to his own mistakes I do love Jeff though
That s probably true but i m a developer p
Same I m a software developer and it really can t be that hard to fix they clearly just don t care that much
The toxicity of the community has made it the opposite of easy Has that really gone over your head all these years
It can t be that difficult to trace if it s easily reproducible The difficult things are when you can t reproduce
Yes people who do not program huge codebases with dozens of people tinkering on hundreds of individual moving parts do often think that things can t be that difficult No Just no You have no clue what you re talking about like someone else above posted Starcraft fans and gamers in general are so off base when it comes to knowing how systems programming works it s unreal
I do that It s not difficult if it can be easily reproduced That s literally the lowest common denominator There s literally 2 things you need The issue needs to be raised and the priority needs to get high enough to allocate resources to work on the defect The developers need to be provided with the steps for reproducing the defect You re just trolling if you can t understand that This will at least lead to identifying the technical issue Yes there may be some other team coordination stuff to determine what the correct fix is once the issue has been identified depending on if there s some governing team that has to approve changes Again it all depends on priority
It s shocking that they re not rushing to hire you for that masterful analysis
It s amazing that you re still trolling this post Clearly you ve never worked on a software project with a team
how would you fix it legit curious
Lock the Leave League button Reset everyone s MMR back to the value they had before the clicked the button They maintain a database for the leagues So just check for a massive MMR increase and flag that account
Similar to what zokker13 said if they don t know what s causing it lock the leave button if they know what s happening but don t know the cause put in a workaround since that outcome is never correct
Is it too much to ask for a We recognize that a bug exists and are working diligently to fix the issue from blizzard
What does this bug even do
Leaving league sets the person s MMR to grandmaster level When they play the next matches they ll be matched against super high level players This is bad for the players because if they win they get almost no ladder points but if they lose to a snipe or all in then they lose 20 30 points
it s not so much the point gain loss more so it s a complete fucking waste of pro players time who want legitimate practice on the ladder
you re totally right but lets be honest here and say that if the defending GM got full points from the win they would complain a lot less
Why is the button even in the game Your placed in a league bc thats where you sit skill wise
Wanted to play ranked got matched with 4 grandmasters isntead fml i left league when blizzard did the early ladderlock to get to masters now i can only get to platinum
Why does the leave league button affect the actual mmr I thought it only affected semi relevant things like points and win rates It wasn t this way in HotS what changed
Won t be fixed until the ladder revamp
Oh yea and along with the promised skins and voice packs and all the other amazing things they promised Blizzard chat shit they always have done dont be surprised if they just completely botch this game for years down the line like they did with WoL Blizzard have not changed they just wanted to get this game as hyped as possible to see if they could get enough money out of it Im seriously done with promises that arent kept by this company mad
r sad and true
I was thinking this for a while but sadly I don t think we re getting that revamp First it was coming early December then it was coming late December then it was coming early January then the season was extended for the ladder revamp then it just disappeared How many times have we been promised things like paid name changes What five years
Oh i didn t say we would get it next season x Btw the season end wasn t extended to prepare the ladder revamp Blizzard would have told us if it was the case Some people say that we won t get the ladder revamp until the nova s mission are released according to a Blizzcon panel don t know which one tho
Yeah I don t think it s ever coming Feels like Blizzard makes a lot of empty promises for sc2 teases some stuff from time to time but never delivers them Just look at the rewards tab Blizzard promised custom skins and animations a long time ago added half a dozen initially and never touched them again Famous people like Lycan can deny that but the truth is that Blizzard doesn t really care about sc2 they are focused on bigger projects like Hearthstone HotS and Overwatch
While I agree Blizzard does a shit job of keeping their word the paid name changes isn t a fucking issue anymore The only reason we wanted them was because you didn t get them every season so once you used a name change you had to buy a new account if you wanted a new ID With a free name change every season there is no reason to complain about no paid name changes
So never
What exactly is the problem with the leagues Forgive my ignorance but I ve just recently started playing again and haven t really been following happenings in the scene
I am just hoping that this ignorance is because of the new ranked system which is around the corner
notice in screenshot its TAPRO They are the ones that abuse that leave league shit Bunch of cheaters and trolls better to ignore them not give them any attention
It really feels like Blizzard doesn t care about the active players that login every day and play on the ladder It s so weird
Can t they just let us set up our own league system like iccup or something that can actually be managed by people who care
What are some potential improvements
the leagues can be managed by the community more ranks than just bronze silver gold plat dia masters gm having divisions mean something and being able to track your progress in the game and not having to use 3rd party websites in order to see how close you are to promotions etc etc etc blizz have talked about changing and improving the ladder pretty much from WoL and they have done basically nothing except for totally fucking it up for the large part of HotS
What ever happened to visible mmr I dunno about how league division could be meaningful while having even more leagues though There s already so many tiers but I suppose another level between diamond and gm could be nice
The best every time I had on ladder when in the HotS beta because everyone in my league knew each other and so the game got soo fucking meta being in a league with people you ve played before and know is so so much more enjoyable than being in some random league playing no name randoms you ll never play or meet again Playing ladder is so fucking dull unless your going to be the next stephano or something and are just grinding and team games are total fucking garbage thanks to Blizzard doing NOTHING but making the most cancerous maps possible If the community or a team was able to come up with there own league for 1v1 team games the ladder would be SOOO much more enjoyable and it would cost blizzard nothing
I ve never really understood who are the other 199 people in my league Why are we split into subsections of our league It would be neat to get to know some players on ladder I think this sorta happens in masters and definitely in GM
It doesn t happen in masters because even masters is too big it happens in the higher leagues in betas and it happens in GM for sure but I ve yet to come across it in a final version of the game because there are so many divisions leagues and players and your mmr is so all over the place
If lag isn t an issue for you the SEA server is awesome for this reason At diamond and up you play the same people fairly regularly and then you re playing mind games and it s awesome
Blizzard easily the laziest company i have ever seen When you consider how many people worked on this game and are still part of that dev team they just sit there and change nothing and fix nothing Let the game to rot im actually so pissed off with how this game has been so poorly managed If only someone who actually cared for their games like Valve actually made SC2 we would have the most incredible game ever and the game would grow so so much No excuses for no fix to this stupid bug nearly 3 months have gone by and they just let it go on forever I could say so much more but Blizzard wont read and wont care and they have proven this over the past 5 years Community deserves an apology atleast
Well they have a monopoly it is human nature for a company to rot from the inside then You need competition to cleanse bad behavior nobody is allowed to use SC2 code and earn money on it so it rots
Well then what is exactly the point of us being here then I make my comments because im passionate about this esport im passionate about this community Today i reached out to blizzard on twitter and asked them to give clarity on why they have no fixed this ladder bug Obviously they wont give a shit about me but if nobody in this community sais or does something then we literally wont have anything anymore for SC2 Lots of people expect this game to literally have no scene after this year that my friend is not acceptable Blizzard need to wake the fuck up and make more efforts to help out we can only do so much
The real question is do you guys actually think blizzard cares They ve already got your money when you bought the game
Dumbest reply on this thread
Does anyone know if Separate mmr will be implemented in the next season too
When nothing is going on avilo shitthreads When there s drama everywhere avilo amazing gameplay Literally bringing balance to the force
Only avilo would hit that nuke to destroy an entire zerg army then proceed to sit in his base more
Map was split at 32 minutes It d be nonsensical to move onto creep in an endgame scenario in which the Zerg army can instantly remax without first identifying the composition and location At this stage it s resource management which matters most I know your intent was to garner cheap laughs from the anti avilo bandwagon but there s a method behind the madness
I encourage you all to listen to this audio only no video LOL
It s getting too hot
Somebody call for a sexterminator
ESPORTS STATUS SAVED
I hopped on his stream just in time to see this I couldn t believe my eyes
lol same I guess the force of MECH called upon us both I got just when the nuke landed and avilo ran away from his computer
why were you hopping on to avilo s stream in the first place tho
When did he take his hat off
He looks a lot older without a hat
esports saved
Hey send out enough nukes and eventually you will hit something
right I don t think I have even seen him actually land something live
Please please please please huuuuuuur huuuuuuor hoooooor hoooooooor
Massed Ravens and siege tanks Avilo game confirmed
Were this any other streamer It d have 88 upvotes Only because it s Avilo we re at 63 I find this stupid
why is it dumb people perceive someone as toxic to the community and the best way to shut them out is to attempt to get rid of their content
As far as I know OP isn t Avilo And this has nothing to do with Avilo s toxicity it was about a great play
i know OP isn t avilo but my point is that if people think avilo doesn t display the sort of attitude we want in the community the best way to respond is to shut him and his content out of it
No wonder your dear community is soon to be dead
I m not even an SC player I ve dabbled and find the game cool so I stay subscribed to the sub The issues keeping people from playing have fuck all to do with this
Yeah so why practice censorship and ostracizing until he acts the approved SC2 way Fuck you fuck this sub and fuck the community if dissenting views can t be expressed and embraced even if they are considered toxic What a bunch of pansies in an echo chamber Do you need a safe space now boy
Haha dude there s a difference between having to act an approved way and just learning not to act like a fucking child
Look at the minimap now tell me how exciting his turtle gameplay is
Yeah SC2 community is a joke Back when Idra was active he basically whines 24 7 about zerg being underpowered and generally being a far bigger asshole than avilo and get tons of adoration but Avilo does the same thing but with Terran and yet for some reason people hate him
I agree that Avilo gets way more crap than he deserves but that s not a fair comparison Idra was by far one of the best non Korean players and probably the best American player ever If he hadn t been so good he wouldn t have gotten the adoration People rooted for him because they thought he might beat top Koreans in tournaments The badboy thing only worked for him off the back of his talent and ended up getting him fired from EG Though I imagine he s happier now since he hated the game
While both Avilo and Idra are whiny complainers Avilo is much more annoying with his squeaky voice yells and cackles Idra just speaks in a robotic monotone and only rages while typing
I wouldn t say he got tons of adoration Also Idra was literally the best foreigner at the time Avilo is a whiny NA mid GM player
lol whut idra was a gigantic fucking faggot i hated his guts skill aside he was a douchebag avilo is idra 2 0 dude
Haha who is this cupcake
There s too many zergs
Because although this was a sick nuke and a great clip avilo is so detestable justifiably so he s toxic and spiteful it s not just his raspy voice that it garners a lot of instadownvotes automatically
where is the youtube mirror
I think he is a maphacker KappaHD
e shport shaved
One good thing finally happening on his stream
Even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while
This will be Avilos reaction if he ever loses his virginity
I don t understand why one person acting like a teenage idiot means you have to too
Found the virgin
that was not a very nice thing to say
Well isnt that a shame Avilo hasnt been to most nicest person neighter
Nukes can make even an avilo games epic
HUUUAAAAGGHHHH Kreygasm
i LOVE the ghost voice acting
Epic nuke is epic
That s the best nuke I ve ever seen in Starcraft
What were you doing watching Avilo
parasitic bomb needs a nerf
terran confirmed better than zerg
Oh my gooood lol So much ded tier 3
I ve seen so many avilo vods posted here and actually never seen his hair before now
Still loses game
Actually
I ve no idea haha but I wouldn t be surprised it wouldn t be the first time
the zerg GGed probably 3 sec after the video cut out
WOO saving esports aviKungfu
Avilo has the best games If I wanted to see 5 minutes games with 2 base all ins or cheese every game I could ladder myself
i think zerg purposely did that lol felt bad for the autist
I opened this link in a new tab and didn t immediately view it I just let the audio play whilst opening a snack lets just say the raw audio of Avilo alone without proper visual context is somewhat distressing if not outright horrifying I fear my freshly opened packet of choc chip cookies will go uneaten for some time now
I hope everybody understand the enemy runs into it on purpose
Wtf You just pulled that out of your ass
dude lol just watch the video and you will see that he even pulls the vipers too so they can also die to the nuke In addition his reaction was xDDDDDD because he knew what he was doing obvious shit is obvious
Or maybe he wanted to broods and vipers to be together
The Vipers moved there and then stopped Because they werent clumping but just stopped above the red nuke dot you can be sure he used hold position on purpose Anyway it was a great nuke but I see if you say something which might sound anti avilo which this clearly isnt you get downvoted to hell
The guy was so fed up playing against avilos turtle style he Suiceded his army on purpose then rage quilted
Rofl all the fellow autistic terrans dick riding avilo hilarious
meh he is entertaining at least It s fun playing Terrans on ladder trying to copy his shit only to fall flat on their face and do the Pause Leave Always makes me laugh
