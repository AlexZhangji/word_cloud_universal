Current Version:
    more efficient and accurate word processing:
        1)merge singular and plural words
        2)merge verb and adverbs
            can be sloved by NTLK WordNetLemmatizer, but kinda slow

Future features:
    Making this as a Restful API using Python/Flask.
        currently working on this one, 60% done.

    Customizable color, selected color scheme.

    Smart auto generated image outline for any given keywords or sites.
        via OpenCV, Google Image Search?
        made a crawler for Google Image search for given words, but Image processing is whole different beast...
